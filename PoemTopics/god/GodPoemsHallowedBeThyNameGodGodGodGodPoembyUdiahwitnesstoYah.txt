Hallowed be Thy name
Hallowed be Thy name we do proclaim
Blessed be Thy sacred name
Hallowed be Thy name
Our Father who art in heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Thy Kingdom come Thy will be done
On Earth as in Heaven the same
Hallowed be Thy name
Hallowed be Thy name we do proclaim
Blessed be Thy sacred name
Hallowed be Thy name
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our shame
As we forgive those whose trespasses
Done unto us came
Hallowed be Thy name
Hallowed be Thy name we do proclaim
Blessed be Thy sacred name
Hallowed be Thy name
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from blame
For Thine is the kingdom and the power
And the glory's fame
Hallowed be Thy name
Hallowed be Thy name we do proclaim
Blessed be Thy sacred name
Hallowed be Thy name
