There are only two possibilities
God the result of imagination
Or God the Lord over all creation
With supernatural abilities
Considering the liabilities
The former, a finite observation
The latter, spirit rejuvenation
With its infinite capabilities
Choosing the former one has to reason
What's wanted is some final solution
An end to it all with no life ahead
I choose the latter for a new season
Trusting in God as my resolution
Gaining promised eternal life instead
