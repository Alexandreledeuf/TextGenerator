God is the greatest artist
To whom no one can compare,
Streaking sunsets very beautiful,
Painting rainbows in the air.
Brushing green the hillside scene,
Blotting blue the sky above,
Splashing flowers 'cross the ground beneath,
Shading white clouds with His glove.
Of the wonders God has made
There is none that is so fair
As the smile He paints upon your face
When you realize He's there.
To The Greatest Artist, whose natural beauty and wisdom both inspired and guided me in writing this little verse
