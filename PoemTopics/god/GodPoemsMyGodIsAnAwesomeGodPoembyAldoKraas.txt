My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
And I have my eyes fixed on him today
While I am walking to school
Because God is coming towards me
To greet me
And there is something going on with my mind
But I don't know what my mind is trying to tell me
Or if God is coming to give me a message
Or to walk with me to school
And to make sure that I am safe while I walk to school
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
He forgives everyone that sins here at home
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
He lives inside of my heart everyday
Because I made room for God inside of my heart
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
He will let the sun shine here at home every single day
And I look forward to the sun every single day
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
Because he is the maker of heaven and earth
