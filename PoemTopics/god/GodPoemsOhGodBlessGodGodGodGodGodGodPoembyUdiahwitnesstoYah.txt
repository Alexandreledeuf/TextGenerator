It's not money that makes you evil
But the love of it that's wrong
Way back during times primeval
Lucifer became headstrong
And tried leading a great upheaval
One third following along
Oh God bless the seven thousand
Who were standing firm that day
Forever lend them a hand, give 'em strength to stand
And guidance in your way
God gave to sinners a reprieval
Until this earth age is done
And before the ages medieval
He sent His begotten Son
For all of His children's retrieval
Away from the wicked one
Oh God bless the many thousand
Who will come to Christ this day
Forever lend them a hand, give 'em strength to stand
And guidance in your way
