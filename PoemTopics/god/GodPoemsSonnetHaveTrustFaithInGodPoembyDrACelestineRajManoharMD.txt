Have trust in God and things will turn out right;
Have faith in God and mountains melt like ice;
Have trust in Him- temptations you can fight;
Have faith in Him and Life will become nice.
Have trust in God for He can do all things;
Have faith in God who solves problems we canâ€™t;
Have trust in Him who selects Leaders/ Kings;
Have faith in Him who feeds Ants /Elephant.
Have trust in God for He is our Friend true;
Have faith in God who remains always near;
Have trust in Him who brings the rain and dew;
Have faith in Him who is our Father dear.
Have trust in God who is so kind yet terse;
Have faith in Him who rules the universe!
