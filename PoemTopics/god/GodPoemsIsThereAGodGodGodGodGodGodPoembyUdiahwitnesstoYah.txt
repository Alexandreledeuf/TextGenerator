One may ask, 'Is there a God? '
For me there can be no doubt
'Cause I learned His sacred name
And in anger cursed it out
God said in His commandments
To honor His sacred name
And to those who broke that law
He would hold them to the blame
The Lord graciously forgives
Is a fact that I do know
While I bear the punishment
I rightly earned long ago
He alleviates symptoms
That from my illness flow
Thank You very much for Your Blessing!
