God is our father, God is lover,
Go is our mother, God is life,
God is our breath, God is light,
God is super power, God is love.
We cannot live without him,
We adore him searching happiness.
God is our teacher, God is preacher,
He grants us to live here peacefully,
God is the creator of this garden,
This is Earth we say as nature shines.
God is professor of many scientists,
Super power he is of trillions of suns.
Great-great-great-many great universes
Trillions of trillions of trillions of such,
He has created by his power, no one can do,
Every soul is self luminous point of light,
Soul is his eternal son who shines like star,
Point to point we note his every word.
Our God is only one eternal God, the creator,
We have much love and respect for him ever,
He never misses and watches us on daily,
His administration is very strong and lovely,
God has made universal laws are truthful sure,
Many changes happen, his laws never change.
Eternal God gives us guidance and we obey,
He is super philosopher and infinite ocean,
He is infinite ocean of knowledge.
