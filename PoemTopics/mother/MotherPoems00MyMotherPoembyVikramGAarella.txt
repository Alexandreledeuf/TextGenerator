In life’s ups and downs, good or bad
She’s always with me happy or sad
I will always long for my mother’s blessings
No matter which way my fate swings, .
Just ask her for help to do,
And she’ll sacrifice everything for you.
If you ask me, have I ever seen god,
Yes, it’s my mother for me, I’ll say with a nod.
Happy birthday Mother[14/5].
