A mother is a mother,
Always caring,
Always protecting,
Always concerned for her baby,
Always holding and embracing her child.
The baby delights in her mother's care,
The baby thrills in her mother's caress,
The baby enjoys playing with her mother,
the baby trusts her mother implicitly,
The baby knows no God other than her mother.
Whether human or an animal,
Whether an elephant or a bird,
A mother is a mother!
A mother's heartbeat resonates along with her child,
A mother's love for her child is nature's purest gift.
