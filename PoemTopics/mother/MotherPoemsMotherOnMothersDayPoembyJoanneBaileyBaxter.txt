You were the center of our universe
The mother of us all
You gave to us your everything
We only need to call
And soon your strength was tested
Though you put up such a fight
For from a distant spiritual land
The angels called you in the night
For someone up in heaven
Looked down upon the land
And chose mom  for her strength
To come and give a hand
He knew that her legacy
That she had left behind
Would withstand the pain and grief
Over a period of time
For she had fulfilled his prophesy
Spreading love, honor, and hope
She instilled in those she left behind
The ability to understand and cope
