My mother, my dear mother, oh!
You love me more than me!
Are such rhymes rather cheap today?
I write them heartily.
How I wish I could ever be
Just crying like a babe
Upon your arms with pain untold
But you would not mistake.
But since today I’ve been a man
I’ve more to live and run.
I’ve loved as much to all I can
But you’re my dearest one.
My mother, my dear mother, oh!
You love me more than me!
Are such rhymes rather cheap today?
I write them heartily.
