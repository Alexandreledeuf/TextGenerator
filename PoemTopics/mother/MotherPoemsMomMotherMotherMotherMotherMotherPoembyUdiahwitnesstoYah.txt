You've been the greatest mother to me
Teaching me many things that others never see
And so I write to you this very day
That The Lord may bless you in every way
Through the years of heartbreak and toil
You've always been there for this boy who you spoil
And now I'm a man whom you trained in the past
Though sometimes I may tell you to 'just kiss my ass'
Anyway I just wanted to say
Thank you my mother for starting me on His Way
For without your teaching I'd be lost today
But because of you and God by my side
Maybe I will find the bravery inside
The strength to withstand every personal attack
That mine enemies throw at me and I might just lack
And so to you the 'world's best Mom'
I'll remember you always as I drop this bomb! ! !
Thank you, I love you Mom
Love, Your first born son
