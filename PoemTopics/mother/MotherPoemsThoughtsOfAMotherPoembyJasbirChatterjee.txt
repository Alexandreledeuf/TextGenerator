My daughter would turn 10 next month…
I find it hard to believe!
It seems only yesterday
That she was born….
As my thoughts wander
Down the memory lane,
I am transported
To those restless days
In the balcony where I sat
On a low stool
With swollen feet and a heavy body
With waves of nausea and anxiety
Drowning me in the abyss of depression
Wondering if I was in for a second nightmare
Much more frightening than the last….
My daughter would complete one decade of her life next month…
I find it hard to believe!
It seems only yesterday
That she was born….
As my thoughts wander
Down the memory lane,
I am transported
To those long, peaceful days
In the balcony where I sat
On a low stool
With needles and threads of different colors
With a pink cloth and an embroidery frame
With my lips moving in a silent prayer to God
Wondering if He was going to make my daughter
As beautiful as the flowers I was embroidering…..
