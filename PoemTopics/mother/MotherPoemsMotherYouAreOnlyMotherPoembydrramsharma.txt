MOTHER, YOU ARE ONLY MOTHER
Mother, you are only mother,
because of you,
i got thoughts and rituals,
because of you,
i got my face, my existence and my prestige,
mother, you are neither goddess nor god,
mother, you are not away from these,
mother, you are my soul,
you are within me,
mother, you aren`t a materialistic thing,
you are omnipresent earth,
you are a firm foundation,
mother, you are away from words,
mother, you are life
