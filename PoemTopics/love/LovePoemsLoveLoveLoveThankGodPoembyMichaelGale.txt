Love, love, love...
Thanks goes to the all mighty one from up above.
You've brought my mate just to my side...
You've led the spiritual path for your son's holy guided stride.
He gave up his life for your good holy loved wide spread word...
Many people were forgiven,
of this fact forgiven ex-sinners have world widely heard.
Fate united me to my bride...
Cupid's arrow gave me such a wonderful wild crazy ride.
Thank God...
Amen!
