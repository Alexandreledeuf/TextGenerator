I know where shall he go
Seven seas or oceans as he lives
In my heart of flesh and emotions deep
No gold I want but love forlorn
From earth to heaven stars and moon
With one glance of love he shall be mine
Away the seductress the arms you bare
My lips parched of my garment unaware
And thou sayest my love thou steal
My love so pure so pure like a child
From Eden descended and anointed with waters
That I brought from my spring of love
