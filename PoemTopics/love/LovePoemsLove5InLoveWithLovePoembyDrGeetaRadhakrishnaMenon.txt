In Love!
But……………………..
Not with love that dazzles and disappears,
Not with love that rejects and recedes,
Not with love that deliberates and deceives,
Not with love that demands and dominates!
I am not in love with any of these,
I am in love with ‘Love' itself!
Love that is unquestionable,
Love that is unpretentious,
Love that is unpremeditated,
Love that is unparalleled!
Yes! In love with love-
Love that is pure bliss!
