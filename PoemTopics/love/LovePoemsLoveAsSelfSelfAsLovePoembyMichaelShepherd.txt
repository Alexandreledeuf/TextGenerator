We do not have to seek for love
nor fear it ever go:
but simply, rest within ourself;
then, love perforce must flow:
for who’s the sweetest company,
as parent, sister, brother?
Those restful ones, always themself;
as one who knows no other..

[This came after watching ‘The Big Sing’:
every seat in the Albert Hall taken
by those singing their hearts out
to fine words; while simultaneously and
in unsought parallel, love flowed..]
