My heart is a wanderer in love
May it ever remain so
Roaming in the pathless land
In a caravan
Just going where the winds blow...
Sometimes rendered miserable
Blown in all directions
In search of my eternal love fable
Inspite of all defections
Always singing the song of love....
Longing for the moon
Searching in the dunes
Will only be still when it becomes crystal
That there is no breath left
For me to fulfill.....
