The seed of love is lying in my heart
the clouds are becoming heavy
the air has become cool and breezy
mountains stands tall and steady
and my hopes are floating on waves
the leaves are rustling so my wishes
and all are desperate to see the dream come true
and this spring is on door steps
the first droplet dances past the eagle
peacock opened its wings
the breeze carries the fragrance
and in seconds the spring zooms
