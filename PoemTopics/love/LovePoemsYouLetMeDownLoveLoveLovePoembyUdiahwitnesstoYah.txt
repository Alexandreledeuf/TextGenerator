Something makes me sad
Something makes me mad
Something makes me glad
You're not aroun'
'Cause you let me down
Wishing you were here
Wishing you were near
Wishing you were clear
But you confoun'
'Cause you let me down
Now that I am blue
Now that we are through
Now that he's with you
I hope you frown
'Cause you let me down
You have gone away
You have made his day
You have lost your way
Your sin aboun'
'Cause it's him you foun'
(a song)
