If true love is love truly
then let true love be true
don't rip a hole in my chest
and crush my blood pump
if you are not surely sure
then walky walk out the front door
cause i'm not playing tricky tricks
or hide and find
with your playful mind
If true love is love truly
then let true love be true
stay with me and love me
and i'll stay with you and love you
