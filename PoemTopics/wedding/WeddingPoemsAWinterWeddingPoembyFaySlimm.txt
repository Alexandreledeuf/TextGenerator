Everyone knew we were heading for snow.
Lowering banks of menacing clouds trying
To threaten cold wedding guests told us so.
You and I cuddled close. I was crying.
After a night of passionate rapture
You would be gone. Yet these moments were ours.
My body, heart, mind and soul you captured,
Snowbound, we then bound ourselves to love's vows.
Your presence has stayed, 'tho war took your life.
It shines in your son, and comforts your wife.
Dedicated to all war widows.
