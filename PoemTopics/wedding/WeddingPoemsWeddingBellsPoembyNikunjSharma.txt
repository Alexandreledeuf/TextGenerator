The stars shall shine little longer
tonight, little brighter as well, for they
need to match the spark of her eyes. The
flowers ' fragrance shall have to live
Longer, for the night is still young.
The Music shall have to fill the air, reach
farther, for the hearts have just begun
to move their feet. The nuptial
dance of destiny waits for  the curtain
to be raised. The eyes shall have to
remain awake, for they need to witness
the genesis of a journey, that shall begin
tonight. The wedding ring finds a new
home, It shall enjoy a new freedom out
of the velvet box. The road
needs to convert itself into a runway
for the wishes shall take off and kiss
the clouds with their wings, aiming
for the horizon and nothing less. The
night sky has to create some space
for the eyes are full of stars tonight
The echo of music, shall resonate
till the doors of the dreams open
and welcome the couple  in their home.
* For a friend who is getting married today.
