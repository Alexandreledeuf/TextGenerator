Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
that should have been ringing
out for you and me.
Now down the isle you walk
with someone else on your arm
instead of me.
We thought in our love
we had everything
until he came along
and swept you off your feet
taking you from my loving arms.
Now up the isle you go with him
to take your wedding vows
as I stand watching,
just another face in the crowd.
I could say something
but I wonâ€™t,
as this is your wedding day.
I shall simply slip into the shadows
and then slowly slip away.
You have a new life before you,
one I hope will bring you joy
as the wedding bells keep ringing
for your wedding day.
