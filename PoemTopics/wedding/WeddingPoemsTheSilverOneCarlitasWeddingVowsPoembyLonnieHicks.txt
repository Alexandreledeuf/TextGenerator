These are twelve rose buds
in the bouquet
I give to you.
1.
This one is my Mind
for it has learned
that our two minds
melding will provide
light for our way.
2.
This one is my Heart
for there can be no
courage without it,
Faith its underpinning.
3.
My Body here now
unfolds
for only you
and under your touch
it blooms.
buffeted by that Innocence Betrothed
which smothers the Cynical Twinge.
4.
Our Future resides here
curled up fetal-style because
indeed our marriage
is just beginning.
5.
Home in this bulb
making it our mutual effort flower.
6.
This one is my shy
steel Devotion
which will not waver
or fall.
7. Here is my wish
for children
who reflect what we seek to grow here.
They are the earthly angels
humans are allowed.
8-9
My Spirit and my Soul
are these rose spheres
which inhabit our aora
these precious buds bring;
and this last is the
10.
Silver One
which is my Love
which opened its flower petal wings first
with you
taking my own breath away.
Under your touch
I,
for the first time in my life
bloomed
reeling from the smell
of rose-bud
bouquets;
of Tomorrows
Futures
and Yesterdays.
These in the end
are not mine to give
but I merely pass them
on to you and us
in the way that Nature
intends.
From these
are made
true Weddings.
