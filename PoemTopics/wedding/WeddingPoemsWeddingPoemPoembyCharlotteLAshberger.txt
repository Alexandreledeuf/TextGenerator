This is your wedding day
and in your eyes
the light of love
is brighter than the stars.
Your heart is full of hope
with all the joyful promise
this all brings.
And the promise will come true,
if you remember this one thing,
Just love each other
as you are,
Don't try to change
this person you found
and learned to love.
Let your love be
the greatest gift
you both receive
and when you do
the love will last through all
as the light that lights
the evening sky.
