Sit down with me awhile, my Love
Let's leave the world behind;
This hour belongs to us alone:
Our moment etched in time.
Lean upon my shoulder, Sweet
And press your cheek to mine.
Let's set our eyes to spy upon
Our promised
ever after
, find.
Rest your arm upon my knee
And hold that smile again.
Another spot is next in line
On our wedding photography.
