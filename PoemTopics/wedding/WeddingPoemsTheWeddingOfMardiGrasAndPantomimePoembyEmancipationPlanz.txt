When Mardi Gras wooed Pantomime
they danced through all the streets,
the gods, whose Credo was the time
sent fireworks as treats.
As time does not stand still, you see
beauty unlocked the door
allowing spirits to be free
and scribes record the lore.
From New Orleans to Times bright squares
Verona, then to Rome
ignoring gawkers and their stares
so far away from home.
With sequined costumes everywhere
spark-lit harlequinade,
of apple shapes or stately pear
enlivened the charade.
As slapstick played with comedy
Toto digging out yellow road bricks,
and under the rainbow's canopy
there was Lion who juggled his tricks.
*****************************
Paparazzi were shuttled in
lenses clicked at the dropp of a pin.
There was always a crush
for celebrity lush,
cover page means you fight 'til you win.
Many dwarves did attend the event,
Mardi Gras, in a wagon or tent.
Pantomime at the door
for today and for more,
'twas Uranus who claimed love is meant.
Pink chrysanthemums tickling the paws
of Koalas (to flaunt local laws) ,
there was Tarzan who stripped,
a much shorter, tight-lipped
Popeye Sailor, who's singing the Bla's.
Theatre audiences, all were in awe
crowds were screaming, 'Mesdames, nous adore'
came Dionysos too
and the Socrates crew
Cleopatra not wearing a bra.
***********************************
As blue smoke pirouettes to the sky,
and the quivers from Burgundy moan,
there's a lady who flashes her thigh
and a tightrope surrounded by stone.
Gays in gowns then assemble, true Queens,
with their bitches performing as maids
Monkey saw, monkey do dancing scenes
of CanCan in their petticoat shades.
Seven dwarves with Snow White and fresh tears,
Pantomime on a horse of pure white,
dressed in blue are the three musketeers
bearing lanterns to light up the night.
Cinderella threw slippers, she knew,
there would come a young lad to her aid,
not a mermaid she needed her shoe
her two sisters preferred masquerade.
Twas a wedding to beat all events,
as white rabbits tossed roses around,
there was Romeo, near the big tent
little Blueboy asleep on the ground.
There was art, there was craft on the stage
and the witch had brought Haensel to town
and trapezes swung high in a cage,
Big Bad Wolf was dressed up in a gown.
On the banks of the river so blue
Papa bear from the Yellowstone Hills,
little Bambi andSkippy the 'roo,
they were smiling amidst all the frills.
**************************************
When Mardi Gras wooed Pantomime
and led her out the door,
she turned and said: ' I give this rhyme,
myself, and so much more;
I pledge my body and my soul
to you my Mardi Gras
and if you like I shall be whole,
discard my finest bra,
and, like a wedge of Maasdam Cheese
I slip right in between,
to have you kiss my cleavage (please)
outside the mens' latrine.'
**********
So now you've learnt the history
of how these lovers met,
and not a hint of misery
a perfect match was set.
When LOVE itself joins hand to hand
no end will ever come,
and all of us must understand
the music of our drum.
