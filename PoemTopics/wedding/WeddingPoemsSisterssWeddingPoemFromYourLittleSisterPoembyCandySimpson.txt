My Sister Has Always Been In My Life
Right From The Start
Now She’s About To Become Darren’s Wife
Because She Loves Him From The Bottom Of Her Heart
Having A Sister Is The Best Thing In The Ever
We Can Never Be Broken Apart, No Never
Having A Sister Is Not Just A Trend
Because I Know She Is My Bestest Freind
Sometimes We May Get Mad
Or Begin To Fight
But That’s The Fun  Part About Having A Sister
We Both Think That We’re Always Right
Now You Are Getting Married Zo
You’re Life Will Soon Be Complete
But I Will Still Come To You
Whenever I Feel Defeat
But Here’s My Chance
To Thank You For All You’ve Done
Because In My Book
You’ll Always Be Number One
To Me You Are An Angel In Disguise
You Are Happy, Intelligent And Wise
If I Had One Wish It Would Surely Be
To Give As Much To You As You’ve Given To Me
Thank You Zo, My Sister, My Freind
My Thanks To You Has No End
Through Our Ups And Downs
This Much Is True:
You’re A Sister, My Sister
And I Will Always Love You!
