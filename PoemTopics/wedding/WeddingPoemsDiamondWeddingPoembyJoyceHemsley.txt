A Golden Wedding had to be
A celebration to remember.
Dancing through the years with thee
Steps were sure ~ kisses tender.
Sparkling  words of love to share
Brimming over with such kindness.
Satins and lace, and beauty of face,
But glamour is now far behind us.
Does love still linger, can it be true
We will celebrate in heaven?
Death us may part, but take my heart
And there will be - A Diamond Wedding.
