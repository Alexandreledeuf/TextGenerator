In our wedding night
I saw the bright stars
Promising us happiness
Through all days to come
My bride I much adore you
You have my unbound love
Your shining beauty
Your gleaming eyes
The doors to paradise
Your cheerfulness
Your radiating delight
The candles lead our way
In the journey of life
The golden bells
The silver bells
They will all chime
Announcing merrily
For joyful future
For beautiful family
Crowning our love
