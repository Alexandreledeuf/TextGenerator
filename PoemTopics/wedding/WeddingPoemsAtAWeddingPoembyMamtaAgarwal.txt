Unlike the days gone by
When the veil covered the eyes,
And the bride couldn’t even catch
A glimpse of one she was getting married.
My niece stepped out with parted lips,
Radiant, swaying to the beat with her hips.
It was the traditional ladies sangeet,
All the naughty songs were played to tease.
The boy was there with his friends,
A formal invitation had been sent.
There was warmth and bonhomie,
Both young and old were acting naughty.
Men too danced with abandon and energy
I too longed to join in the revelry
Come on dear, what… he said with a start,
Let’s too dance, I feel young at heart.
Disgruntled, 'you know I have two left feet',
Let me lead,  and you move with the beat'.
'Mam, that's what I have done all my life,
From the day i took you for my wife...'
Ladies sangeet is a musical evening, a day before the traditional north indian wedding ceremony.
