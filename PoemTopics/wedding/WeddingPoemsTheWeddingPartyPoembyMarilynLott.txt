How special it was as family and friends
Gathered to welcome husband and wife
Happiness was felt by everyone
As they start this precious new life
Pictures taken to collect memories
To pass down for generations to come
You can see by the smiles on faces
Fun and food was enjoyed by everyone
No happier occasion can there be
That brings folks together again
Than a wedding filled with loved ones
With wonderful wedding trends
What a perfect way to start a new life
With a love that is forever true
Congratulations to the bride and groom
We wish only the best to you!
