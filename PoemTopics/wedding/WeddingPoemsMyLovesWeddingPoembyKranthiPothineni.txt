One said, its a secret
So don't say to anyone
Said, she is marrying
That she is, my love
The one, don't knew it
Heart stopped for second
And started to pain badly
My throat too had felt it
But my lips had smiled
And said, its good news
The one said me date
And told me to come
By then heart was broken
But my lips still smiled
Said, wish i can do so
The one started to say
About my loves only love
So my ears were on job
And lips carried the talk
But rest of me had died
The one told me all
About my loves love
Then my dead heart felt
My loves love is better
Far far better than me
So I wiped my eyes
Said bye to the one
And placed hand on heart
Said, its time to sing
For my only loves wedding
Wedding, which i can't go
My broken heart is weak
It can't break down more
But its each broken piece
Sings a happy marry life
Forever to my loves wedding
