Isn’t it funny how all of a sudden you care
But when we were together you were never there
Isn’t it funny how to make me jealous you’re with her
But when you see me with him, everything starts to blur
Isn’t it funny how you want me to miss you
But when we were together, other girls you’d pursue
Isn’t it funny how you think of me when you’re alone at night
When im across the street in his arms wrapped up tight
Isn’t it funny how you sit there thinking of me
While im in the sky, completely carefree
Isn’t it funny how much the tables have turned
I hope from all this, SOMETHING, you have learned
