Were born, work hard at school, then work
hard for a family. Everything is right or
just about right, then death reaps. Makes
one wonder, about a pulsing heart beat
away from death. Just seems, GOD, in
heaven gives and then takes. All vanities
and lusts of life, appear fools play in the
grand spectrum.
