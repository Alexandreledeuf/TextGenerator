Beautifully
you enter the room
Everyone turns
to absorb the splendour
of you.
Your angelic way
shines, as you lower
your chin and smile.
Flawless eyes
like diamonds keep
the room mesmerised
filling their
hearts with smiles.
Your long
flowing brunette
hair, as if touched
by the hands
of angels
caresses the beauty
of your soft neck.
A sweet aroma
floods our senses
to the very perfume
of you.
Elegantly, you
glide over the room
as if carried
by the hands
of God.
You gaze into
my eyes with your
arms out wide
and reward me
with the kindness
of your beautiful
soul, and so romantically
say.
Here, eat your bloody
dinner before it
gets cold.
