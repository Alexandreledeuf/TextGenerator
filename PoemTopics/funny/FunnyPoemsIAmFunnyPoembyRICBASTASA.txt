i am funny
i cry upon hearing the pleas
of the goats
transported from the
market to the
slaughterhouse
it is ridiculous
as others think of the
goat meat well spiced
for their next
sumptuous dinner
i am funny
thinking about the mass killing
of natives in the south
as other still think of the gain
on the next delivery of
guns and ammunition
i am not just funny
i am crazy
and they are not ridiculous
they are serious
for wars to come and shall never end
for the violence they create
so they may have all the profits
and gain
reality is not funny
war is a serious business
the government is crazy
worshiping a master
this great puppeteer
