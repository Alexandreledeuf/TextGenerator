I want to untwine
my youthful body aches
more pills make it go away
it's mind blowing
intertwining worlds, of hate blood
horror pain and mud
you've become a shadow of yourself
your eyelids shake when your eyes close
yes you are still all alone
you are the endless stars
you are the colors in the sky
you are the sun that finally shun
to remind me another day had just begun
destroy, create, repair,
it's all in the open air
and I'm back again.
Dissect my quivering relapses
before everything collapses.
