It's funny how you said you loved me, then you left me for someone else.
It's funny how you would talk to me as often as possible, and now you completely ignore me.
It's Funny how whenever I was with you I always felt like I was special, But now I feel like a fool for wasting my time on you.
It's funny how I believed all your lies...
But the truth is it's not funny at all.
