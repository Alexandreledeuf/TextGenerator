You used to say
'Dreams never comes true'
You used to think
'You are just cheating me'
But time speaks by itself
and stronger feelings
can't be hidden so long
Now, I have seen your arm get turned
I have seen your sight changes
Cause now you can't keep blocking the sun
with a single finger
Cause now is too late to block your heart
I am already living there!
You know is truth
You know is reality
No matter time
No matter spaces
No matter how
No matter why...
Cause Love has no rules
Cause Love is law
Love has no limits
Love is an endless power
and change us in his weird way
This is Life
just suddenly changes
Getting us in love
Getting us on pain
Getting us into new learnings
Just getting us
Into his Funny way!
