Tears come in funny places
when you least expect them too.
All of a sudden the eyes well up
crying out, with sounding vocals of ones, boo-hoo's!
You'll find them sometime appearing
while bidding a loved one, 'ado.'
Some are shed in a moments sadness
they are just that emotions, emotional fuse.
One might try to restrain their tears
from flowing down ones cheeks.
But you will never be able to stop their flow
it might cause you to spring a leak!
Joy, sadness, fear and anger
and from ones laughter, sometimes too!
Tears come in funny places
they can and will happen one day to you!
