The other day
I woke up feeling low
I tried not to think about you
to stop the inevitable tears that threatened to fall.
Funny things tears, they linger yet do not fall.
That night I got angry
as I walked fron the bus stop to my home
My mood slowly dissipated into sadness
I felt the bloody tears linger
am guessing they showed because some ladies looked at me
gossiped and actually stood to stare
Funny thing tears are, they know no shame.
Yesterday I drunk myself into a stupor
because I couldnt bear the thoughts
the happy memories, the questions.
I smoked because I wanted to burn away my pain
my loneliness, my intense craving to end it all
Funny things tears, they come when you least expect them
Last night I hated you
Hated my intense stupid love for you
Hated that my life was blank without you
I went running, jogging to absolve the pain
to numb myself, but pain is stubborn
I ran for miles but still felt that swift flash.
Funny things tears, they burn.
Today I woke up
ignoring my phone I tried to resist it
to resist the urge to call you,
But I did,
Lunch, drinks, kisses more promises
apologies more excuses
smiling, laughing, forgetting
Funny thing love it forgets the tears easily.
Tonight I sleep soundly
But Tommorow I work and the cycle begins.
Funny things tears sometimes they cleanse you.
