Down on the Funny Farm
where some say I was born
where laughter is the key
that trips a smile
to whoever visits there.
There is no time
to feel moody or forlorn,
not with a crazy sod like me around.
Howls of laughter echo
from every room.
Now even the animals
have joined in the game
at our home the Funny Farm,
the place some say I was born.
