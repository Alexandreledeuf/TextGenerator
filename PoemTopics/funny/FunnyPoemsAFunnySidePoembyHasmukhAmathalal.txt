Oldie is dreamy
Really it is funny
Sun may not have remained sunny
It might have been witnessed by you and not by many
It might have come out from west
You might have gone for its test
Your may be searching for the rest
You prove to be dreamer and try for best
We see so many irrelevant things
It certainly to do something
The chain of thoughts goes on continuously
It is useless thinking if we admit honestly
We can’t base our plan on dreamy side
The reality and fact may remain open very wide
It may have pleasant side in the isolation
It has nothing to do with facts or relation
Still it is nice resort
We have so many comforts
Things move on as per our wish
The end has got very nice finish
Why it makes you so much happy?
You find beautiful girls to marry?
The sun doesn’t get set at all
It is always pleasant and happy call
Reveal it not for even for amusement
You may invite adverse comments
For you it may be fine moment
Enjoy it to self and make good movement
