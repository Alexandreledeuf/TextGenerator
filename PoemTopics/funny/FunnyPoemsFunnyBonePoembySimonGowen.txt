I need to ask a question
While I'm sitting here alone
Why on earth did someone name
The elbow, Funny Bone?
Ev'ry time I bang it
The last thing on my mind
Is laughing out in ecstasy,
And shouting something kind
Instead I want to lash out
And jump and scream and curse
The pain runs through my body
Only toothache could be worse.
So if you are a specialist
Please do your best to serve
A clumsy man who's sat in pain
I've banged my Ulnar nerve.
