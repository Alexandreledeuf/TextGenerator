uncle john badly wants
to be the president  of
the United States
because he thinks
that's  the only smart  thing
an old man can do
and auntie Sarah badly
wants to be his
Vice President
because she thinks
that's the only pretty thing
a lady from Alaska can
hope to do
she even thinks it can
keep the body warm
better than the moose
and the polar bears
and who does not want
to be a VP of a president of 72?
it is just a step, a breath away from
becoming President
and  the shoe fits so well
but there is a little hurdle
uncle john cannot seem
able to cross
uncle john cant  see
the difference between the
A and  Z of the costs
to run the country, on
gas, regular petrol or
on premium
and when the banks come
tumbling down
he is laughing and rolling
cheering everybody: up:
'dont dont run, dont cow,
it is just the money
rolling down.
the foundation is
strong. the foundation is strong
just dont  you run,
it is just the banks'
new investment calls.'
and  and auntie Salleh
oh oh no, no, no
while sitting  on television
for  the interview of her life
she cant think about anything
but begs to call  her friends
to help her out
Oh my lifelines, my lifelines
where are the moose?
where are the polar bears?
the pitbulls? hockey moms?
and my lipsticks....errrr
