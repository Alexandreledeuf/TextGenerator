Taking my little concerns and miniature
plans too seriously instead of laughing
at myself, telling all with shiny eyes of
my new ideals, taking new medication
enabling me to eat less and sitting still
for longer periods
The sitting still is happening, but without
a large dose of interest, is quite useless,
mind growing bored tries to veer off, yet
discipline keeps me at my desk without
accomplishment, boredom grows as I
fail to find islands
Of glorious escapism to give my feelings
a break from cold emptiness, floundering
I cast about, the world shrinking to fit into
my aching head changing me into a use-
less robot without interest, passion or
ideal - immobile
Without feeling and emotion - without
conscience to power movement of my
head and eyes, reading words without
understanding anything, unable to set
priorities - I have become a useless
robot - at least
I used to be a funny human being
