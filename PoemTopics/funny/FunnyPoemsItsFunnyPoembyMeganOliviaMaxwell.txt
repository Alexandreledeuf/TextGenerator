Its Funny...
When im happy I have a bad day
Its Funnny,
That when I wish it was hot it snowed
Its Funny,
That when the world is finally at peace War begins
Its Funny,
When I fancy Chicken my mum cooks pork
Its Funny,
When I get a new phone It breaks
Its Funny,
When I tell my friend a secret and politely ask her not to tell a soul but she does anyway
Its Funny,
When my mate does something wrong I get in trouble
Its Funny,
I want to watch a movie on T.V but theres a powercut from start to finish
Its Funny,
When I ask for a cat for my birthday, I get a fish
Its Funny,
When I say I love you
You reply....I love you too and I always will
