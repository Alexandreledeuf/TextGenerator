When olive branch, we show the world,
They think, our weakened stage has come,
And treat us worse than ev’n before!
When flag of truce, in hand we hold,
They stiffen conditions on us,
As though we can’t fight anymore!
When bow we as mark of respect,
They look down upon us askance,
As though we are worthless on earth!
The world today is suspicious;
The human lives are less precious;
There’s dearth of people more pious!
Man wants to do whatev’r he likes;
Money decides the things he does;
The love in families seems gone.
One wants to make a quicker buck;
One takes more risks and tries his luck;
One feels things can be got by pluck.
Oh, what a funny world, it seems!
The human face appears well-masked;
The heart of man is ne’er contrite!
