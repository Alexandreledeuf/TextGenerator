I had a funny dream,
about a marshmallow ball...
he made me so giggley,
then my skin started to crawl...
that cute little puff,
of sugar and sweet,
was very soon,
a scary little treat..
he grew and he grew,
out popped feet and hands,
and then i woke up crying,
after being eaten by the marshmallow man.....
: '(
im now officially petrified of marshmallows...
