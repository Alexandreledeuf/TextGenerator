Isn't it funny
when people flick their hair and look
down at you, snickering?
hehehe
Isn't it funny
when nature whips its lash and rips
through the sky, thundering?
roarrrrrroarrrr
Isn't it funny
when machines go bezerk and leave
a trail of broken pieces, destructing?
crrraaack
Isn't it funny
when you realize that these things
are not at all funny and
want to bonk yourself on the head?
No, not really. But humans
often find horrible things hilarious
as long as they are not the source of the
Funniness.
