isn't it funny,
how the world likes to be?
isn't it funny,
how much you don't mean to me?
isn't it funny,
how much i care?
it really isn't funny,
when you're not there.
isn't it funny,
how we used to be?
isn't it interesting,
what you meant to me?
isn't it strange,
how we fell apart?
isn't it great,
we both miss our hearts?
one last thing,
before i throw this ring,
wasn't it funny...
to see what i'd do?
isn't it laughable,
how i still love you?
