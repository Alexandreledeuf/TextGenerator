There are many funny things
that people take with them,
when they are desperate,
and go into the loo.
My boss the other day
took some long handled grabbers in with her.
I am assuming she took them with her
to help pull up her knickers.
I once found a five hundred-page novel
ever so well read.
Iâ€™m thinking the person who left it there
must have brought his bed.
He would have needed it
with that many pages to get through.
The next time you go to the loo
just look around at the funny things
others have left behind
and try to work out
what they wanted them for.
