It is funny, isn't it,
how fast one can go
from joy to sorrow
down life's twisty road.
It makes her laugh
even as she cries...
Turn the other cheek
or let love die.
So, he called you a liar,
he says it's true,
no matter what you say
or what you do.
'Tis soul-killing
to suffer so,
to be thought as less
than the truth you know...
Well, time goes on
and another day comes;
feel the soft air, the sweet warm sun
and hold fast to this truth:
that you aren't over; life is far from done.
(9.3.06 - The sun shines for you too, Little Spirit.  You're not finished yet...)
