Isn't life funny sometimes?
The ups, the downs,
The smiles, the frowns
The utter beautiful confusion
We find ourselves in?
When doors close and others open
When the rainclouds disperse
And the sunshine warms your face
Rainbows dancing in your garden
But you can't hold that pot of gold?
And then there's love.. love?
What is that? Is it a mutual sharing
A pairing of souls that 'match'
A slow dance in your irises
And a flash of lightning in your heart?
Or is it a cold, harsh thunderstorm
That doesn't abate, that ultimately
Leads to that word, 'hate'?
I don't like that word, really no
Hate isn't something for me
But I enjoy living, and feeling
Even if that feeling is often
Hard and difficult to understand
And faith, when held in your hand
Is so fragile, delicate and pure
This tango of life, this passion
That jumps into my heart and spins
Trips over itself, haunts me
Is all I ever want to feel, to be..
And I am so unashamedly thankful
To everyone that has ever touched me
And made me, Me.. otherwise
What would I be? Just another lost soul
Walking along the road of life
Without ever scuffing their feet
I love that my soles have blisters
And that scars are worn with pride
That this happy, fantastic wonderous ride
Is a journey I'm glad I didn't miss
It is surely, utterly, bliss
