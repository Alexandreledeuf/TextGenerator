it's funny how hello is always finished with goodbye
it's funny how good memories can make you cry
it's funny how forever never seems to last
it's funny how much you would lose if you forgot about your past
it's funny how “friends” can just leave when you are down
it's funny how when you need someone they never are around
it's funny how people change and think they are so much better
it cant be packed in one letter
it's funny how one night can contain so much regret
because the funniest part of all, is none of thats funny to me
