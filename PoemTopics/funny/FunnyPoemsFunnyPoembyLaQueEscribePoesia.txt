Funny you should say,
That the world is spining,
Funny you should say,
That Manchester is winning.
Funny you should say,
That time flies fast,
Funny you should say,
That's all in the past.
Funny you should say,
That death is dawning near,
Funny you should say,
He turned a deaf ear.
Funny you should say,
That life is full of honey,
But for that you need money,
Hmmm... funny.
