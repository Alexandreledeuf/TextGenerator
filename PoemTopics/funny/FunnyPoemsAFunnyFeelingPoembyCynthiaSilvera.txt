i get a funny feeling
it comes for deep in side
i get all mad and angry
wanting to go and hide
my doctor calls it depression
my dad says its just me
but the thoughts and feeling
no one will ever be able to see
some say im psycho
some say im weird
its like im a different person
and the old me just disappeared
i get really edgy
i want to die real bad
then i get a headache
followed by feeling sad
i wish it would go away
maybe if i keep praying real hard
it will someday
