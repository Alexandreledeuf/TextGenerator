Love makes many lose temper
Others get hurt
Some even cry and forget about their existence
Unlike my funny man
He is always happy
Laughing and cracking jokes all the time
Amazing how funny he is
When in trouble he stays calm
He stands still and plans ahead
No time for worries
His presence hinders me from remembering
all snares the world brings
Because of him I refuse to think
the world contains stubborn men
His funny stories never cease
and my happiness will last forever with my funny man
Little by little he is turning me into a funny woman
I can feel the changes in me
There is always a smile on my face
Whenever I talk, he laughs and becomes happier
I know I am his funny woman
What a pleasure to have my funny man around!
