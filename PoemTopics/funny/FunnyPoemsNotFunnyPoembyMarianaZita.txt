It's not funny when
you laugh and call
me names
I don't smile  when
you push me down
and laugh
I don't find it very funny
when you dis me and
say it was just a joke
I'm not the one who  laughs
when you call my name but
turn away
Your jokes  are not funny
and never will be so stop
saying them
