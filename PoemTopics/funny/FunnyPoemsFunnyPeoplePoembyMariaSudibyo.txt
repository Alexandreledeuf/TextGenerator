Sometimes you get laugh
For something that really funny
Sometimes you could laugh
To something that doesn't intent to be funny
Sometimes you make laugh
Because everybody understand what's funny
Sometimes you laugh alone
Because you are the only one that think it's funny
Sometimes you try to laugh
Just to be looked funny
Sometimes you are forced to laugh
Despite it isn't funny
Sometimes you can't help to laugh
Even though it is not actually funny
