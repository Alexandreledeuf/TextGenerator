see that woman
flung over her son's dead body
howling from the depths
of her womb
what has she
to do with war
or war with her?
*        *      *
if all the mothers in the world
denied war in their mind
and in their speech
what would happen
in the mind of men?
what is the powerful
compared with the power? *
(* ancient belief: man is the power-ful, woman the power)
