as you trapped me
as you attacked me
I saw it all
I saw you change before my eyes
I saw the mask fall
I saw the true you
the evil you from inside
how could I have missed this
for I lay there trapped
trapped staring into those eyes
evil eyes
I could see your evil mind at work
for you were laughing as I screamed
as I cried
you laughed when you broke me
you enjoyed it
you torn my body in two
leaving me in pieces on the ground
you enjoyed it all
all the pain you caused me
when you were done
you smile and said
'I know you enjoyed it
they always do'
it was then I realized
I was not the first
and I wonâ€™t be the last
