you trapped me
you cornered me
then you attacked me
why didnâ€™t I see all the warning signs
you broke me beyond repair
for when you attacked me
you stole something that can never be returned
as you stole it you laughed
for you enjoyed it
you enjoyed it as you torn my insides to pieces
you enjoyed tarring my body in two
you used and abused me
and when you were finish
you tossed me aside
and moved on
just like that
you changed my world forever
and you just stood up
and walked away
when you reached the door you turn
and I saw
all that I was once blind to
I saw the evil in your eyes
I saw your evil mind
I saw the smile I once thought was kind
I realized in that moment you were pure evil
the purest I had ever seen
