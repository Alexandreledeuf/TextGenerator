in that moment
I realized
what I had to do
I could not let this happen to more girls
for I know I wasn’t your first
and if I don’t do this I will not be your last
I now you will not stop on your own
so you will have to be stopped
for if the girl before me realized the same
I might still be whole
but instead I am in pieces
I am broken beyond repair
you stole something from me that can never be returned
so I own it to your next victim
I own it to myself to fight
to stop you
to make you pay
and I will make you pay
pay for all those you hurt
pay for everything
