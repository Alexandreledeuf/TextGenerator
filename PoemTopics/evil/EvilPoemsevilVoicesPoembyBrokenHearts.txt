A sense of evil lurking around
I lay broken on the ground
Forgotten in this place
That has no grace
A voice telling me
To go get that knife
Don’t put up a fight
Just commit suicide tonight
You’re already all alone
You are dying inside
So just make yourself bleed
Everyone will be pleased
When you are dead
They have no need for you
In this world
So go get that knife
Take it down your arm
Go down the vain
It is one way to kill yourself
With less pain
Please just do it
They want to find you
In a puddle of blood
On the ice cold floor
As you lay there dead
The evil still fallows me
I just sit there and listen
Taking it all in
But I can’t decide
What I should do
Get that knife
Or just sit and listen
