The modern world seems crazy to the core;
We strike a balance in most things we do;
Money appears to solve problems many;
Muscle does some things that money cannot.
The Media makes celebrities o’er-night;
Influence guides bureaucrat’s decisions;
Merit is given a back-seat most times;
Merchants make money paying taxes least.
Most honest citizens are taxed the most;
Success smiles on men without conscience;
The righteous eke a livelihood of toil;
The lazy ones make money rather fast.
God allows ghastly crimes to happen too;
Nevertheless, both good and bad things end;
The evil-doers have a mighty crash;
God gives a longer rope to most such men.
This does not mean that dishonesty lasts;
The wicked suffer punishments on earth;
They fizzle out like soap-bubbles in sun;
Untruth can’t rule the roost on earth for long.
Reality will bring justice to all;
The day of reckoning will seal all fates;
All evil hearts can’t escape God’s judgment;
Their harm will be disclosed in great detail.
God’s mercy may not save them from Hell’s fire;
The upright souls will get rewards from God;
The God of goodness loves the righteous;
He takes them to His own Abode- Heaven.
