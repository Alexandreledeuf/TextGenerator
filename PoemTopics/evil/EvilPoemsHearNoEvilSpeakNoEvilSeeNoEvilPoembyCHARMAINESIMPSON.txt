You left behind a bad taste in my life
Not unlike a cold cup of sour vomit.
You left behind a bad odour in my memory
Not unlike maggot infested rotting flesh.
You left behind a bad sound in my mind
Not unlike the screams of a tortured child
You left behind a bad picture behind my closed eyes
Not unlike the vision of a tortured nightmare
You left behind a bad feeling in my heart
Not unlike the sensation of abuse I once suffered.
You have left behind a scar on each of my senses
So that I can remember you,
Not unlike my memory of a cold, heavy, dark sadness.
