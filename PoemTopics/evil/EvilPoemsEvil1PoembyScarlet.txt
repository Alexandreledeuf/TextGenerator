with just a glance
a small glance into your eyes
I saw your evil
evil eyes
and evil mind
I felt it in my bones
but I didnâ€™t understand it
for you looked so normal
besides those evil eyes
such a kind smile
I thought
I must be wrong
for you are but a normal guy
for you were a pretty boy
beautiful blonde hair
that perfect smile
you had it all
everything a girl wants
and even more
for I found out
your were not just what every girl wanted
you are also what every girl fears as well
you are both what we search for
and what we run from
such a deadly combo
