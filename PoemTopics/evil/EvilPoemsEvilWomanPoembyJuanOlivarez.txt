A woman, made you cry,
A woman, took your breath away,
from deep within she drew your sighs,
and left you dreaming in the day.
A woman, made you play the fool,
A woman, made you bang your head,
at four in the morning, creeping like a ghoul,
wishing you were some place else instead.
A woman, laughed as you played the clown,
when you tried to impress her with your wit,
when you thought there was no one else around,
but she toyed with you, as she saw fit.
A woman, with ice around the heart,
A woman, that you never knew,
she broke your spirit, like a poisoned dart,
no, you never knew her, you had no clue.
For love of a woman, you gave your all.
For love of a woman, you walk alone.
For love of a woman, you had to fall,
a woman with a heart of stone.
