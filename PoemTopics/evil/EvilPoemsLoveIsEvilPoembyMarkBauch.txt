Love is so evil
There is a certain pain
When you feel it
It can make you go insane
The feelings you feel
Are at the bottom of your heart
You feel love from the very first spark
You bottle up the love and put it on the shelf
Take cupidâ€™s arrows and shoot your self
So you feel like a soaring dove
Wanting to be with your special love
Letting the feelings take you away
Drifting you to the very next day
So love can not be all so simple
This is why love is so evil
