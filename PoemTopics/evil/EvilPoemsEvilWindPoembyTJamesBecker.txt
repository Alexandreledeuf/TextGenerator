Sun scorched barren ground
Like spreading lines on shattered glass
Cracks split wide the arid terrain
Thirsting for much needed water
What once was full of fish and plants?
Is now a dry useless river bed
Skeletal remains of life rot in the sun
Animals thirst for a dropp of lifeâ€™s liquid
Garden full of beauty now withers
Limp and stringy vines droop, barren
Birds gather round to pick the last seeds
Soon move on as death has come to all
Children cry as hunger invades tiny bellies
Nature is in control nothing can be done
Warnings long ignored the evil winds blow
It bares the name of Global Warming
