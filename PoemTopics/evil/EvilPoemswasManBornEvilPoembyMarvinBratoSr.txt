Adam and Eve were overcame
By Satan in the Garden of Eden
Since then man has been possessed
By an evil spirit which quite  obsessed
To tempt and drag the soul to damnation
But Jesus had given His life for our salvation.
Everyone is prone to commit mistakes
No good man is his life has never done fakes
Especially at times when something is at stake
Life, honor and love are those posted out for the take
We all succumb to temptations to Satan's evil wishes
Forgot that Jesus' s blood cleansed all our blemishes.
Everyday life's tribulations have got into our way
Filling us with sorrows, frustrations and dismay
Exciting the demonic instincts lurking inside us
Compel human to do bad things which are unjust
Becomes evil curses himself by blaming the Lord
Why man was born to hurdle the pains of the world?
