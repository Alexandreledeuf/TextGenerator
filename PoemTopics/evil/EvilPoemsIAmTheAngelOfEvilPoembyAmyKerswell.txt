I am an angel.
I am of no good.
Im an angel but more like a parasite.
I feed on your fears.
I pray on your insecureities.
I feed on your despare.
I am your demon angel.
I live to make your life hell.
It is a story left unsaid.
I and only I no.
I am here to destroy you.
I hate you.
For I am the angel of depression.
And i will eat away at you day by day.
One day I will destroy you.
