Devastation wrought
In agonizing ill
Of God's omnipotence
..Or..Satan's will
Would...an Omnipotent God
Allow Satan's power..then
Might the Devil himself
Be some necessary sin
*
*
And 'good'....and 'evil'
...Destiny's course
Conceived and executed
..By that...Omnipotent Force
Author's Note:
'Consequently, if you believe God made Satan, you must realize that all Satan's power comes from God and so that Satan is simply God's child, and that we are God's children also. There are no children of Satan, really.'
â€• Anne Rice
