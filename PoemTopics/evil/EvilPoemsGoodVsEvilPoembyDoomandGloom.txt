Glory to thee O Lord on high
O maker of all that is holy and true
Over creation your rule will apply
Divinely inspired in all that you do
Vail of perfection
Shattered in two
Evoked by the one who gave us breath
Vanquished from high, yet spared from death
Into the depths this dark angel fell
Left unopposed as the ruler of Hell
