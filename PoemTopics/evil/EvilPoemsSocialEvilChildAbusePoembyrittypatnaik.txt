a child abused
a gift from god refused,
insanity at its peak,
makes young
and vulnerable weak.
beyond the scene of laughter
a murky cry of torture.
it pains to see,
a child humbled and scared,
with pain in the eyes,
unspoken fear of shame,
and a broken pride.
a gloom of darkness
around him spreads,
afraid to trust and,
mind never at rest,
shadow of torture
tears his being,
all his life
he sees himself dieing.
a childhood thus,
pain imprints in mind,
what ever happened,
to that glorious smile.?
a child
gift of god,
a blessing for parents,
a laughter in the home,
dont lose him,
to the darkness of fate
take care of him,
it is never too late.
