I should have stayed with my first instincts
for when I saw you
in the back of my head an alarm went off
it screamed evil
pure evil
but I ignored it
you changed before my eyes
but I didnâ€™t pay attention
I ignored all the warning signs
until it was to late
I should have turned and ran
but instead i stood there like a sheep waiting at the slaughter
I just stood there
before I realized what you planned on doing
I as trapped
I was cornered
and there was your chance
and you took it
you attacked
