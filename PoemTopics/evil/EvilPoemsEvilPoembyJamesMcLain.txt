Evil, is to hunt 'you.'
smell you.
Nameless is 'EVIL.'
EVIL, ...unawakened
slides inside 'invited'.
Out of reach, TOUCHED
bloated within your womb.
EVIL, sweats you out, in taste
reaching down you check.
Trembles, hand in night, is to
dawns wasted light, in wait
sucking you inside, to rest.
EVIL was it, 'you'it's eye to
weep 'milky'you hunger, it.
EVIL, will not wait, forever on you to
reach down, close the fold, it's now.
EVIL will never be satisfied, with one
you are 'EVIL'drawn to all that's EVIL.
