I see all who die.
I saw all who lived.
I am eternal,
Never dying,
I am evil incarnate.
God of all that is death,
God of all that is hate.
I hate love,
I hate joy,
I love sorrow.
I am viscous and cruel.
I am the twisted version of man,
And itâ€™s lust for power.
I am the result of evil,
The poison of man.
I am  the creator of death,
The bearer of all symbols of hate.
I am the destroyer of worlds.
I am the beginning,
I am the end.
I am you,
And every one around you,
I am the poison in your heart,
The darkness in your soul.
The corruption flowing though your veins.
And you,
You are my host.
And you cannot be saved from me.
