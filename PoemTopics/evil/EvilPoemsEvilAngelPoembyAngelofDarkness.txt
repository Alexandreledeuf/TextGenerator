There's a beautiful Angel
sent from up above
but she's and evil Angel
the heavans call her love
This beautiful Angel
she falls down from the sky
looking for someone to torture
on the wings of a butterfly
This Angel seems to find you
wherever you may go
she lands upon your shoulder
and love she does show
This Angel is evil
she gives you love then takes it away
Leaving your heart always empty
for her love is never here to stay
This Angel has hurt me
many times before
so I'm closing my heart completly
It will be broken no more.
