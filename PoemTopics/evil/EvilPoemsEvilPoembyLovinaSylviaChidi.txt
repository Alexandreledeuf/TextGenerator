Once you were civil
Until desire brought upon evil
For the sake and love of wealth
You hit good people below the belt
Don't you know what I already know?
All substantial material will come and go!
Evil is the enemy and is envious
Evil is vengeful and vicious
Evil is ill, immoral and inauspicious
Evil is loathsome and lawlessly ludicrous
Once you were civil
Until desire brought upon evil
You conceal, steal and kill
To round up your shady deals
I do not wish to intrude
Neither do I wish to be rude
But did you know as you should
That evil will never conquer the good
