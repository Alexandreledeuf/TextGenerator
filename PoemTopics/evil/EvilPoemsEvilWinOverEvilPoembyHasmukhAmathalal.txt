Be positive that is welcome
But never push away negative thought to come
Let it enter and settle down
Then you think of your own
Same way allow negative people come near
Keep no grudge or fear
They may harm no more
As you have sufficient power to counter
Never get swayed over
They may be finding excuses or cover
You must win them over
They shall be friends forever
It depends how you tackle
It is just and honest struggle
Wicked people have never won race
As they have many thing to hid on face
You are bright and shining
Every thing you are defining
In nice and convincing way
That is your style and distinct way
So keep all kind of people
Around you and in circle
Sometimes they are needed to fight evil
Evil always wins over lesser evil
