Do you see the evil in me?
It shines through me illuminating, and spraying.
People pass me and automatically start praying.
I am not playing with what I am saying.
I believe in me, so that
means I believe in the evil inside of me.
It talks to me, and through me.
The people who know me,
don’t know what has taken a hold of me.
It’s sees for me, and controls me.
This darkness knows me, it owns me.
It shows me the way, tells me what to say.
Evil believes in me, and I believe in evil.
It whispers to me, honors me, and is ever so loyal to me.
This evil that lies inside of me.
It knows me.
This evil is me
