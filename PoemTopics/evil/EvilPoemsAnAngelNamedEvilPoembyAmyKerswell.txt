I know a lady called misery.
That is me and my life.
I encountered an angel called evil.
She was rotten to the core.
She gave me depression.
She gave me suicidalness.
She gave me hell.
Shes an angel full of evil.
She came after me.
Within the darkness of the night.
She wants to kill me.
She wants me dead.
She'll have me dead.
Shes taken over my mind.
Shes over riden me with evil.
