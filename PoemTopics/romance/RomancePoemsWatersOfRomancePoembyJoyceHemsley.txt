A letter to his love:
Meet me tonight by the water of dreams
In the moonlight ~ this is my plea.
Your charms fuel my longing for romance
Oh how I cling to the beauty of thee.
In love I shall be for eternity
So treasure this heaven and patient be
Often my eyes are moist with tears
As I sift through old pictures and souvenirs.
Let us walk and talk by the water's edge
On the sands down at Cascade Bay.
In the calm of night our hearts may unite
And over the sea we could sail away.
Our love would then be a beautiful song
Caresses adding to passion's fire.
Pure as the morning waters that flow
And as pleasant as lingering desire.
Promise you'll be there ~ to start anew.
I'll hold you close in the old-fashioned way.
By rivers and streams, as moonlight beams
We will add to the memories of yesterday.
