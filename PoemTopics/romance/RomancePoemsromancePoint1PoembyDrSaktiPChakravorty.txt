‘ROMANCE POINT’ [1]
esspeecee … [06.10.08.]
Questing the fragrance
Of dews,
On the sod
Where you left
Foot print.
Blind I’m
To view,
But will
Find that fragrance
Thro’ my
Acute sense.
But –
Alas!
You’ve lastly
Effaced
To take back
With you.
Oh spry
Dear,
Thanks for
Left fragrance
Of sod.
Happy I’m
That grass carpet
And nascent leaf blades
Whispering-
‘tis is your
‘Romance Point’.
