The air cold, crisp to the lung
Breath circles skyward bound
Days fall short, shadowed by the night
Nature climbing into hibernation
Trees standing bare, flowers wilt away
A world still beautiful to the eye
Yet emptied of all its colour
Still my heart it does rejoice
Warmed by anotherâ€™s kind grace
A muse of such beauty to the soul
Playing out this winter romance
Early evening the moon stands proud
Casting its light through windows
The streets line solitary in shadows
There is not a care but for love
But for love there is not a care
All the beauty of a romantic thought
Is shared amongst friends
A winter romance begins
The beauty of the season
