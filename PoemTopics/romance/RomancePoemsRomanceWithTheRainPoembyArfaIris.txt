Touch of rain drops makes me giggle.
like a lover, it tickle.
and makes me laugh and wiggle
rain touches me with a bliss.
like a sweet and lovely kiss.
when in rain i get drench.
like lover my clothes clench.
its like someone dear
.
who cuddle close and near.
the cold tender breeze.
makes me shiver and freeze.
still its better than a hot mug.
or a tight warm hug
.
rain makes me romantic.
and i feel naively idyllic.
