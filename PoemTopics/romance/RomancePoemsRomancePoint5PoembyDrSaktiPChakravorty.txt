ROMANCE POINT [5]
esspeecee …11.06.09.
Why browse
Thro’ eyes
Why not open file?
And save as
‘Save as…’
Cut and paste
You can do
But it’s not
Aye: To love.
Copy and paste
Still not
Aye: To love.
Open the file
Fiddle and fondle me
I can’t be hidden file
If saved as
‘Save as…’
Browsing thro’ heart,
Bring me near
To your
Tremulous heart
I’ll be with you too in
Choreographic synchrony.
.
Make a virus check
To prevent goofing
Love is:
Dewy drops of rapture
Get coalesced effortlessly.
When saved
Send the love
To me by
E-mail with correct ID.
I’ll save
It, as save as…
No, save into
My breast silhouette
Where plays cosmetic
Red, blue, green &c
A designer
Canopy of
My Romance Point.
