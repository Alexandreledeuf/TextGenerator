Its me you love,
And this I know,
Its him your with,
Oh where'd you go?
I loved you right,
And held you tight,
So why let me go?
I doubt I'll know,
What I did wrong,
So now I'm gone,
And don't answer my phone.
You searched for me,
To bring me back,
But now know,
I couldn't come back,
You made your choice,
And lived a lie,
So why did you go and die?
You searched for love,
And knew you'd never find,
A love as good as mine.
