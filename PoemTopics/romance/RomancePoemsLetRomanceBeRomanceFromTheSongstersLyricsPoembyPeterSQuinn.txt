Let romance be romance
Every dark night be morning
And love our 2nd chance
In love's ever turning
From its doubling dear
Giving so much and close
Just by heaving you here
Like sweet morning rose
Every day is to be fine
Coming in for a kiss
When there's rising sunshine
With everything there is
Love falling younger
Into everything sung
Every day so much longer
In the summer's tongue
Rising and energizing
In new dreams of creation
Imaginations beauty stylizing
With romancing gradation
Love songs to do and give
Feeling of desiring long
This around now to live
In anew found around song
