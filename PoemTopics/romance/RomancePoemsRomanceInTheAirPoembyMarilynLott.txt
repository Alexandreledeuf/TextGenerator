It started with a little smile
A flirt and bat of the eye
For Elaine saw the man
She wanted to be her guy
John knew before too long
His life was about to transform
Elaine was so pretty and so sweet
She sort of took him by storm
So the courting began before long
Friends they were from the start
And as feelings began to change
Love festered and grew in their hearts
Nothing would be the same again
It was bound to happen, it’s true
Much thought in both their minds
It didn’t happen out of the blue
Of course there is a happy ending
A life they wanted to share
And it all started when one day
Romance was in the air!
