There is heaven in rosy looks
Hell lies in gloomy glance
There is sunshine all around
Why not make it a romance! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Our life is a ballroom dance
Enjoy it you have a chance
Tired! See how others dance
Be happy in their love trance.
Time and tide wait for none
Why don't make life a fun
Calumny and anger shun
Others hearts will be won.
If jealousy you nurse
Smoldering fire traverse
Life becomes a curse
Can't sing love verse.
This Christmas let's dance
Let's take a chance
Harmony & peace advance
Hatred from heart distance.
