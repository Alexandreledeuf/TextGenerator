I wanted to tell you
how it is that I love you
it used to be so easy
I'd pick up a pen
and let the words flow in
choosing the right ones so freely
But then I'd let someone
talk me into destruction
of all thinking and feeling
Just once a day this pill
which, at times, makes me ill
supresses... well, pretty much anything
Now it seems like every day
feels strangely the same in every way
like lifeless circles of day and night
They treat me for depression
by drugging my brain into submission
yet somehow, I'm not a zombie... right?
Forgive me for my senseless rambling
trying to keep my brain from scrambling
A battle I very much seem to be losing
There was something I had to tell you
but what that was, I have no clue...
Hmmm... I think I need a nap.
