You rule the kingdom of hopes & dreams
with your tales of romance you carefully weave
And then when it seems there could be no more
another book opens & all are in awe.
Who could be the queen of your heart
every girl longs to fill the part
To bring to life such a fantasy
Being so well loved is pure ecstacy
