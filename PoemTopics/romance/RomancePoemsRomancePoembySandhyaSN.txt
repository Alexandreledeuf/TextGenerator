Romance the charming wine of love
Emollient lubricant of heart
To incept and pulsate
The loving beats in the life
Its smell even could winsome thoughts
With amiable fragrance of jasmine
Which furl one over and over
To flame poignant in its fire
It takes one to a lofty locus
And levitate to those blinking stars
And it twines both together
As chords of life to sing together
But beware of its resilient style
Which hustle you to mundane desert
To reap the barren insensible mind
With the paralyzed numb dumb heart
Oh! Dear! Tie it tight, the chord of love
With charming fragrance of romance
Lest it will play a twang
To portray farce in kaput fort
