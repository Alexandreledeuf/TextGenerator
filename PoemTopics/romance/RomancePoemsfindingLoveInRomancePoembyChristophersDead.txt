She said that one day she might come back
But this is how it's been for years
I walk on tight ropes and stay too close to the glass
And I hide from my greatest fears
Well I'm done, with holding one
I'm hanging up, the will is gone
Tomorrow brings, a new religion
Yeah you can say I'm taking this one for me
I took a day out to remember
Just the way it felt, the sun and the air
I rode for hours following the train tracks
Until the sky said, yeah it's time to leave
And there I felt, a sudden bolt
Of static life, and electric soul
Today I feel, I can carry on
Love and life came back to sing their song
Can you remember the way it felt
Can't you feel the fire burning
Yes can't you reveal to me how this
Never-ending love could have failed
Well here's to you â€˜cause I'm moving on
I lay out sprawled upon the sand
And I know that this is who I want to be
I hear the waves crashing onto the shore
This life-long renewal has new meaning
