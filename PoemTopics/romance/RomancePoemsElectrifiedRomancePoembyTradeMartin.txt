The shock makes me shake……,
When I’m in your embrace…..,
Sends me like a rocket into outer space…..,
Almost nuclear power…….,
A sensation I cannot erase……,
Thunder shakes me……,
As the passion takes me……,
And I don’t stand a chance……,
With this Electrified Romance……,
Can’t resist your magnetic charm……,
When we touch my heart sounds an alarm…..,
To run away, but I really want to stay…..,
Cause I’ve got high-voltage streaking through my veins…..,
As a Sensual Telepathy*** connects our brains……,
It’s an Electrified Romance……! ! !
