She wears a black bar over her eyes so you don't have to see her
Or at least she believes so if she can't see you
And her skin sticks to her clothing, pulsing sweat from the sunlight
If you get under that bar long enough you'll stick like glue
The accidental shirt slips down under the finer linen
Embarrassed that she has the shirt on in the first place
The finer things in life come free anyway, that's what she says
But she keeps that bar over her eyes, your mind starts to race
And when she smiles
And you're in denial
You can't help erase
What you know in the back of your mind she is
She's just a teenage girl, does she know any better?
Just a teenage girl, certainly her dad wouldn't let her
A teenage girl, and you wish you could have her
But I'm a teenage guy, and she's mine
Though I can't help wondering why she wants you
And I hope and pray that one day she'll look back at me
You know she likes you â€˜cause your hands are so damn big
Well how the hell am I supposed to compete with that?
She wears a black bar over her eyes so you don't have to see her
Other censorship seems a waste when she gives it away
The finer things in life come free anyway, that's what you think
But I swear that I'll make you pay for taking her from me
And when she smiles
And you're in denial
You can't help erase
What you know in the back of your mind she is
She's just a teenage girl, does she know any better?
Just a teenage girl, certainly her dad wouldn't let her
A teenage girl, and now yeah you have her
And I'm just a teenage guy, she used to be mine.
