How does one make the life so romantic?
No problem even if your friends are living beyond Atlantic
There is no distance barrier and one sees directly
It is enough to rouse feelings if we speak honestly
Even seasons inject the feeling of romance
The individual may find appealing with little glance
It may certainly give relief when first shower is on
Everything sounds dramatic when heat waves have gone
It takes away your concentration when beautiful eyes are met
What a magnetic pull effect when wishes are responded or let
It was beautifully hidden in one side of the beating heart
You are in no position to think or respond despite looking so smart
Beautiful and attractive faces play all the tricks
The magic environment persists without use of sticks
How does one fall in magnetic pull of attraction?
How does the individual respond with any reaction?
One good smile takes away his beautiful smile
He doesnâ€™t know how to carry on for a while
There is strong urge to come very close
They may try to prove good and try not to loose
To go in for quick seduction may not work any longer
They may need some to help them as messenger
The bold action may follow suit if both are sincere
Romantic words are exchanged without any fear
The romance has got no age bar
They can come closer while driving in car
Each one finds a feeling of super star when they meet
The whole world seems to have fallen or come under their feet
