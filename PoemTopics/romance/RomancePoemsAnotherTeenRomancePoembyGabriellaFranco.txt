Uh oh! wakin' up from a dream
Wishin you were here with me
Jump up and down, now clap ya hands
One more teenage romance
Single? yeah, thats my thing
No commitment, no promise ring
Scream 'yeah' if ya understand
One more teenage romace
CHORUS:
Find myself waitin for your call
When i dont think of u i think of nothin at all
So if ya agree-scream shout and
Give it up for another teen romance
Oopsie daisy I'm lost in your eyes
For a moment you're the love of my life
Ever ended forever? lets see a show o' hands
One more teenage romance
1 week? 2 weeks? maybe a year?
How many temp. forevers we got in here?
Daddies an mommas got up n ran
Uh oh. Another teen romance
