The pages of the years
Are crying of the same;
Each word - each silent sound reminds of you,
I'm counting days
By just extracting from dimension 'love'
Dimension 'pain'.
And I'll forget you, love
Just when a blind man draws
One sound on the non-existing wall,
One of a rose
That's falling quietly on the castle's floor,
No longer whole.
Through all the darkest nights
I'll have your worst nightmares,
I'll be your one eternal candle's light,
I'm always there -
We breathe the same and so much filled with love
October air.
And when the ages die,
The broken hourglass -
The symbol of the battle 'Love and Time'-
Will speak of us.
The world, no longer knowing what is love,
Will speak of us.
