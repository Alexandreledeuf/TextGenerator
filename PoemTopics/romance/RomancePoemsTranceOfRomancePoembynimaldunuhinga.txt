A sapling in a severe drought
what she needs is moisture to survive?
The Ogre shows a goodwill and who crawls
to the scenario for the redress.
But she cannot uproot and how can she abandon
her kith and kin?
She has already mesmerized by his laudable dialects
and does she obey to this Monster? .
She dreams of the fertile soil where she goes to bear flowers
in the next summer.
She bow and stretch her springy hands
to this promiscuous lover
who takes her cunningly to the Utopia.
