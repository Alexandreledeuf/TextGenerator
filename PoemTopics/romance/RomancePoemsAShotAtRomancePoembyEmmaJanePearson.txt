She was only ever ‘that girl’,
The one who always awoke instantly from the sound of:
An angry door slamming,
A single tear hitting the cold floor,
And a razor blade being dismantled from its safe covering.
But when she was with him-
With his arms of steal padlocked around her,
Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her,
Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep,
Their two fragmented hearts beating so close,
But they never got a chance to beat to
Beat as one.
