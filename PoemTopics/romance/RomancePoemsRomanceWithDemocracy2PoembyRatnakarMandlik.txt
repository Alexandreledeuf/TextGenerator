The era of romance, its beginning.
Dice used by the players was startling
In the game of numbers on chess board
To tilt the power house and it's record.
Hottest commodity than gem or platinum
Turncoats were costliest in the millenium.
A keep of treachery had become wisdom
Criminalization of politics was in blossum.
Ethics, morality became out of fashion,
New tricks were evolved by imagination.
Merit and efficiency were then displaced.
Money and muscle power to them replaced.
No one can fool all for all the times,
Players had forgotten this truth supreme.
