I am truly scared for him,
I am not sure that I would vote for him,
I believe he needs experience,
but, ... this seems like his time.
His message has a resonance,
as if he's going to make a real difference,
not for some, but  ALL  this time,
... political romance.
Bobby had that vision,
and they put an end to him,
in a kitchen in Los Angeles,
since then, the light has dimmed.
Damned partisans without regard,
for fear of non-selection,
simply vote along the party lines,
and pray there's no detection.
Blindly followed leadership,
if you can call it that,
beg for more, demanding more,
...  and threaten through their party hats!
They view the people as an evil,
to maintain a ' cushy ' circumstance,
their employers are annoying,
and so they lie to us with political romance.
I am truly scared for him,
because an educated black man,
is still the biggest fear of far too many,
that refuse to understand.
I've heard it said that there are none so blind,
as those that will not see,
that cut off their nose to spite their face,
and somehow think that makes them pretty.
It only takes one idiot,
and one finger on a trigger,
to end the dreams of millions,
by killing one smart...  dreamer!
I'm not sure that  I'll vote for him,
his experience, an issue,
his intellegence is not in question,
but, will his motives be diffused?
This feels like the time to me,
to ask for one more dance,
and hope the partner understands,
- - - more than political romance!
