Two past midnight
a very bright light awakened me.
Seeing this luminous light,
I walked towards my picture window to seeâ€¦
and this is what I saw...
MOON FUSION
The full moon shines brightly
Through the dark and hazy cloud
Enchanting rays rest softly
Among the trees and the ground
Serene Scene Sweet illusion awaken
Of you and me under the moonlight
Of our souls coming together as one
A most radiant shadow of the night
