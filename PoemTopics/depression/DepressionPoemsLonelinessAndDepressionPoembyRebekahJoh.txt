You have an empty feeling that comes from within
You long to share your feelings but no one will listen
You reach out for open arms, but nobody is there
Your tears fall to the ground, but nobody cares
You pick up the phone, but have no one to call
You feel overwhelmed; your mind is a crawl
You lay in your bed in the light of the moon
Just so you don't see those who aren't there for you
The flames spark inside you and heat up your fear
Your thoughts are suicidal, your days are so drear
Emotional fires burn up in your head
Fires of love and pain and regret
Consumed in your own darkness, you slowly fade away
Your once blue and sunny sky has turned to clouds of gray
