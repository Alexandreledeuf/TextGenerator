No outward sign for you to see,
I try acting as normal as one can be,
Desperation is my call,
Suddenly I've had enough of it all,
The tears, the moods, the ups and downs,
What is happening with me,
Leave me alone I say, let me be,
Everything gets to me this misery,
I must divert my thought on the good things when negativity pulls me down,
I must think positive and redesign my life,
Yes, this is what I must do,
Burying my head under covers is not the way for me or you,
I am aware this won't be easy,
It all takes some time,
But before you know it things will work out just fine.
