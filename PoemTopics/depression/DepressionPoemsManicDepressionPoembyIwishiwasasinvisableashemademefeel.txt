Tears on my pillow,
cuts on my wrist,
use a razor,
if bleeding resists...
Resist temptation,
to seek help and advice,
let pain be your friend,
let pain be your life.
Don't eat food at all,
become fragile and weak,
self mutilation,
forget how to speak...
Listen to the voices,
the ones in your head,
they say they hate you and want you dead!
Finally through the darkness,
you see hope,
a closet, a chair,
a short length of rope...
After you fall your painful life ends,
Manic depression your only true friend! !
