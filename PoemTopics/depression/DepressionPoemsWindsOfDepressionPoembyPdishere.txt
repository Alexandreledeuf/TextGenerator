Twilight declares its arrival
The waves crash against the rocks
The traffic moves slowly
The crowds buzz by
We can't look eye to eye.
The mood was light
Now silence hangs low
Thoughts create a tornado
From him to her and her to him
Suddenly melancholy spurts
And words follow.
The winds of depression
From the fathoms of the ocean
Swayed-
Our mood
Our talks
Our thoughts
Our love
For a while
And no more.
Lights glowed bright
Waves calmed
Traffic smoothed
Crowds did not bother
Luckily,
Oceans have a shore
Winds changes course
The winds died down
Depression sucked out
Eyes found the strength
To look at another of their kind
Only you were around
With a heart full of love.
