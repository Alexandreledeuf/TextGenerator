I no longer know me
I don't want to be
I look in the mirror
and a stranger looks back at me
She too is in a bad dream
No one can hear her scream
Her eyes blindfolded and her hands tied
Her voice is muted and her mouth open wide
Strangers all around her
A stranger by her side
She stands in the middle and has nowhere to hide
She's shaking and trembling like a terrified child
She's half crazed, animal like, out of control and wild
