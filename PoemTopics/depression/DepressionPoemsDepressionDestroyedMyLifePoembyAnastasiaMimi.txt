Depression destroyed my life.
It told me I was no good.
It told me I was all bad.
It told me I was not loved.
It told me I didn't deserve treatment.
It told me I deserved to die.
Depression destroyed my life.
I listened to what it was saying.
I told myself I was no good.
I told myself I wasn't loved because I was bad.
I didn't seek treatment to feel better.
I tried to kill myself for his entertainment.
Depression destroyed me.
I am left picking up the pieces.
He has left me alone.
He said it was to late for help now.
He left me scared and confused.
He is still here.
He wants to keep me.
And he will keep me.
Depression destroyed my life.
All I am asking is that it does not destroy yours.
