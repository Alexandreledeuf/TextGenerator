The world is falling
I can't seem to keep in reality
my life is growing dim
I can't see from behind me
My thoughts race
All I feel is pain
and of course parents say
no pain no gain
but this pain is different
it hurts my heart
it has and it hurts
inside my heart
What is this pain
that I feel inside
that is called depression
and that's what you are trying to hide
I constantly think of bad things
like sadness and lonlyness
but that isn't the word
the right word is depressed
but why am I depressed
I am as happy as I can be
but on the inside you hurt
and it's depression you see
The only way out
of this dreadful hell
is to try and heal
what is making you dwell
But I don't know
what could it be?
well it could be
my father drinking?
yes that's it
I have found the key
to me being depressed is my dad
and his drinking
so now what do I do
Hell is so bad
well you need to go
and talk to your dad
I know it seems hard
and you are scared
but don't be afraid
if he loves you then he cares
So that's what I did
and I am no longer sad
but I can tell you one thing
I am no longer in hell... and no longer sad
so now I feel better
and you should to
and when you find out why
what are you going to do?
Do what's right
it comes out for the best
and then you feel happy
and no longer a mess
