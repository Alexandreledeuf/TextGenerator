Depression takes over my body.
making me dizzy, sick, and sad.
as i walk the halls with a blank face
i'm dieing inside with so many thoughts it takes over my body.
i walk the halls with tears running down my cheek.
with black merky makeup running down my blank expressionless face.
i woundered if anyone noticed
whenever my teacher sounds my name, my heart starts to ache, surprised someone actually knows i exist.
i wounder if anyone notices the depression taking over.
i smile blankly but crying endlessly inside.
no one knows 'me'.
all those lies catch up with me.
all those memories haunt me.
there's just so much that time cannot erase.
i wounder if it'll ever change.
i pray but then what happens?
Depression is my disease that doesn't go away.
i've tried many times to get rid of it but never did go away.
so i listen to music to get the pain away....tempararily.
