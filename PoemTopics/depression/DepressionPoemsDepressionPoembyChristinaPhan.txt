Depression
Hurt very much
I feel it when someone break my heart
I feel down and be by myself
You can't focus
You can't do anything
Don't you see baby
What you done to me
Depression
Can be when one of your family or relatives die
It's hard to face it
We have to deal with it and move on with our life
It going take one step at time
We can think back on good memerioes
Don't let this get to you too much
