Depression takes hold
losing all control
fake a smile
act for a while
cant make you sad
please don't worry
no need to hurry
cant see me this way
I'm so scared
please go, PLEASE STAY
lost in confusion
i feel me losing
every-things gone wrong
and its all my fault
how can you act OK
I'm such a fool
to think you were true
depression takes hold
losing all control
so i take a knife
my last GOODBYE
