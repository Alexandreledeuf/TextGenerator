Take me home
Take me home
Take me home Lord God
Take me home
She broke my heart
And it won't mend
I say please Lord God
Let it end
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home Lord God
Take me home
Was it all
Just a lie
I say please Lord God
Let it die
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home Lord God
Take me home
Why she left
I don't know
I say please Lord God
Let it go
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home Lord God
Take me home
