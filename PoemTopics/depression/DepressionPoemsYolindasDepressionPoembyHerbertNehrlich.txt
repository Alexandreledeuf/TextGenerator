Yolinda often was depressed
she then stayed home, inside her nest.
To help her illness she used gin
it quickly did restore her grin
but alcohol's welcome effect
was not expected to correct
her melancholy disposition
thus it required repetition.
She managed thus for many years
depression and some other fears.
And on her deathbed she required
the liquid she so much admired.
It helped, this time she drank a quart
before she left for God's resort.
