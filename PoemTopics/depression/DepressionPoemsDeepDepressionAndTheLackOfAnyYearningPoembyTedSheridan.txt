I remember as a child I had a deep seeded fear of heights
I would envision my demise long prior to even a possible fall
Once as a teenage boy I knocked a front tooth from my mouth
When I jumped twenty feet into a drainage ditch next to our house
My mother rushed me to the dentist with my tooth in milk
He soon restored my youthful smile
But did little if any at all to replace my fear of falling
As I still panicked whenever I even stood close to a ledge....
For the last sixty years I have managed to cope more or less
Always waking up before any tragedy occurred
But last night upon being led to this cliff in my life
I jumped and have not landed yet
as I knew it was a bottomless pit I was entering....
