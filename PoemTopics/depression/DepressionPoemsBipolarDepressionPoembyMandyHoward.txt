Many ask, if I'm high,
Many ask, if I'm low,
Many ask, why are you so happy?
And many ask, why are you so sad?
Many questions asked, and I don't answer,
Many don't ask questions, and I'm left to question myself,
Many ask, what's wrong with you?
And many ask, what's wrong?
Many seem confused, but I don't care,
Many don't care, and now I'm confused.
Many wonder,
Many care,
Many laugh,
As I breathe for air.
Many know me, and I couldn't care less,
Many don't know me, and now I couldn't care more.
For those who don't know me,
I'm full of ups and downs,
Twists and turns,
Lefts and rights,
Many roller coaster rides.
My energy goes up and down,
My brain twists and turns,
My mood swings from left to right,
And then from right to left,
And then once more just a couple more times,
It's like a never-ending pendulum.
I think of life as an emotional roller coaster ride,
That has no beginning,
And has no middle,
And most of all has no ending.
Confused much?
I would think so...
But do you understand...
