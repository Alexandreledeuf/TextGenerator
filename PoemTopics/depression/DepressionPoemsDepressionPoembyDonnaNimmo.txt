Don't want to live
Don't want to die
Sometimes I just need to cry
So I get out paper and pen
Once again depression sneaking in
I'm so lost within my soul
Pain from the past, trying to control
Darkness trying to steal my light
Trying to turn my day, into night
Got myself a brand new life
Need to bury the past, keep out the strife
My mind I struggle with from day to day
Please make the bad stuff, go away
They say that time heals all pain
Will my day come, or is it all in vain?
So once more I need to write
And maybe later, my day turn bright.
