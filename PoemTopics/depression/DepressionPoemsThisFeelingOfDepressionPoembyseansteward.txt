This feeling of derpression
i tell you it's just this
a feeling is that which never was
a thought one day you'll miss
this feeling of depression
i tell you i'm alright
now leave me be and go away
lets put off this fight
this feeling of depression
i tell you i'm ok
now close your eyes and rest your head
lets wake to a brand new day
this feeling of depression
i tell you i control
with every ounce and every bit
held deep within my soul
this feeling of depression
will go away someday
untill then i'll bide my time
perhaps to god i'll pray
this feeling of depression
i tried to tell you, why?
are you never here to hear me ever
not even when i die
this is a horrible attempt to remember the origonal i wrote a long time ago terribly sorry to anyone who reads this
