i can't stop wondering why
i sit still and cry
hoping everyday
i change my destructive way
preventing others in
but yet commiting my on sin
thinking everthing is immoral
because i am drowned in sorrow
no one knows the tears i shed
while lying in my bed
every night i prey
to feel better the next day
but never stopping to think
maybe this is my way
