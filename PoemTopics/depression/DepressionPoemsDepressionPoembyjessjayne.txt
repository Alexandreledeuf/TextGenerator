Depression is when you hate everyone around
Depression is when you don't want to make a sound
Depression is when all you want to do is cry
Depression is when you feel like your dying inside
Depression is when you thoughts wonder all the time
Depression is when you can't sleep even though your tired
Depression is when you don't want to go on
Depression is when you can't stop shaking outside
Depression is when you hide who you are
Depression is when you put on a mask to hide what you feel
Depression is when you feel weak all the time
Depression is when you give in to everything around
Depression is when you don't care what happens anymore
Depression is just another day in my life
