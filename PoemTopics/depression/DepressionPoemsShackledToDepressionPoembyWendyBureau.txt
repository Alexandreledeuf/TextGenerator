Shackled to depression
Intertwined, amongst my veins
Self worth, self love
Are lost, within the pain
Anguish and shattered dreams
Lie embedded in my heart
A glimpse of personal torture
Revealed, within the art
A medicated mind
Does it offer resolution?
Candy coated prescriptions
Swallowed, without solution
Blind to the rising sun
Of opportunity, to thrive
Another breath inhaled
Without purpose, without drive
Shackled to depression
Consumed by failure, and disgrace
A crying soul unseen
I walk invisible, without face
