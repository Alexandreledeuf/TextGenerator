Depression is raging.
In the mist of its anger.
It eats my happiness.
Fasting on my sadness.
Depression has its hold on me.
Throwing me into despair.
Making me more and more insane
As my mind it drains.
Depression'll take me all the more
It dosent care so long as it has its hit.
It hates me every single bit.
Every day it kills me a bit more.
It wont stop till its had its frill
It wont stop till its got me dead.
