Oh my God the pain
of desperation
within the walls
of my depression...
the greyness of it all
a world awash in muted tones,
blandness as its epitome
blocking life's rainbows
from existence within my memory
reaching deeply with suffocating tendrils
that wrap my soul in confusion
and disgrace...
a great sadness
abounds here, locked
behind closed doors, awaiting
loves anxious arms
that come no more...
