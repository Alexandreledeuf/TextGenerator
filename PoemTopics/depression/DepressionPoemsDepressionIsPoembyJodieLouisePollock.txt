Depression is Loving someone with nothing in return,
Depression is Slowly living instead of jumping head first,
Depression is Acknowledging the mistake but without learn,
Depression is Not trying, giving into your lifes curse.
Depression is Cutting and cutting thinking you cant stop,
Depression is Staying quiet thinking no-one will care,
Depression is Floating around with the desire to drop,
Depression is Ignoring the people who always seem to be there.
Depression is Trying to end the life youve been given,
Depression is Watching other people watch you,
Depression is Giving up instead of being hard driven,
Depression is Depression, do you feel it too?
