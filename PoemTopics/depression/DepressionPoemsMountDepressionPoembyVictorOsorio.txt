I'm worried about you
You want to be like me
Why? Don't you want to live?
It's very sacred up here
It controls your fear
It controls your pain
You'll look for help right away
Depression puts up a shield
You'll become what I am
If this is what you want
Join me and leave yourself behind
On second thought
It's crowded, stay where you are
Do not commit this sin
Think about Mount Depression
Now fall back to nowhere
I never want to see your face
Find yourself first
Everything else will fall into place.
