(Dedictaed to Unborn Sufferers and Victims)
Who stopped my pulsation
In first days of life exaltation?
Who ended His Blessed Plan?
Intruded with bloody hand
In the realm beyond man?
What savage craze dared to defy His Plan?
What gory hand put an end to a tiny man?
Intruding with bloody plan
On a powerless... vulnerable man?
What savage craze dared to defy His Holy Plan?
Who dares to slaughter His costly creation?
Tear into pieces! ... burn! ...
Do the grisly, damnable mutilation? !
Who would do this to an innocent, tiny man?
Defying His Hallowed Plan?
Barbarism!
Beneath man!
Who stopped my pulsation?
As savage beast terminated
My maturation, and exaltation?
Who ended His Blessed Plan?
Intruded with bloody hand
In the realm beyond man?
Barbarism!
Beneath man!
Satanic barbarism!
Unspeakably lower
Than any living thing!
Beneath! Underneath!
Way behind man!
Unrepentant killers!
Bearing the weight of the slaughter
Dare not! call yourselves 'men'!
But a savage, untamable beast!
Unrepentant slaughterers!
And, all bearing the weight of the slaughter!
At the End...
You will be called
Among creatures 'the least'!
