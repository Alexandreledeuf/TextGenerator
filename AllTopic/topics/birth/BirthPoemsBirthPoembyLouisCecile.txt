You can never lose that part of you
Our hearts were beating as one
You nourished me made a home for me
When I gazed upon you I cried
For a moment I needed to return inside
Bringing comfort
So much to teach
Longing for speech
You make me stand tall even when I fall
Our lives together
Eternal connection
That cannot be broken even in separation
Not just for set backs
You are my inspiration
Through my creation
Though I fail often to show it
You are my devotion
