oh! wake up my lovely princess,
allow the sun to rise for you,
and sprinkle its golden rays,
with all its effulgence in, bright
golden hue and sparkle! .
let flowers of all hues and colors,
size, shape, layers and fragrance,
jasmine, rose, lilies, lotus, dahlia,
iris, tulips and daffodils vie each
other to decorate your lovely
hair in plates, layers and multi
layers, and  let the sheen in your
eyes brighten up the beauty of
the jewels and silks you  wear
and let the fragrance of lowers
enhance your mood fly high and
spread joy and happiness for
you, family and friends and let
me hold your hands and wish
a happy and joyful birthday! .
