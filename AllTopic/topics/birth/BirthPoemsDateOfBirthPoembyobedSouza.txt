‘... unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.’
(Jesus Christ)
I won´t forget the day
I stumbled on a pearl
On my way to the graveyard.
Since then our roads
Have drifted apart.
You tell me
I  died from  a gush of water
Sprayed out of the fountain,
Others  say I  choke to death
From a gust of fresh wind.
As I walked up that  road
Your laughter was everything I heard,
Since then our paths have slowly blurred.
You wonder why I ´ve been
Prospecting  for gold
Just to  load my  gilt gun
To shoot me dead.
Yes, you are right!
I started to see the day I became blind.
I started to live the day I died.
