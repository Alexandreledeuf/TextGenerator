In an open field I sit,
my life has turned to shit;
as I take this blade,
and I make my slit.
In the light of the moon.
I'll end my life here tonight;
enthralled to watch my blood flow,
under pale moonlight, at midnight.
A deep angled cut,
to make things right,
as I see this blade,
reflecting the light.
Staring up at the moon,
my mind will depart soon;
it's almost time for me to go,
soothing feelings of vertigo.
May my blood...
seep back into this earth;
ending my life...
returning me back to birth...
