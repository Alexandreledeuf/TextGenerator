as i remember my day
with the angel by the side
embracing the time unstocked
as resourced from the womb
with the verses by the heart well-define
as i share those when mutterings
yet the whispers of solemn river
when curved over cravings undiscovered
yet sweet words in mute undertones
crystals of the glass dazzling
quite breakable as nobody knows
even may cruise and handle with care
still it ripples from the skin
from the templeâ€™s stone
the birds chirrups over the tree
nest when hanging by hinges of the breeze
my moments of the time peeling off
ravings when melting slowly by the hours
i look back as the leaf falling apart
from its core i look forward with anger.
