GAUTAMA BUDDHA
Before the Christian era,
In the 6th century, in India,
The religion was forgotten.
To winds, it was thrown.
It was a period of chaos,
None cared for the Vedas,
When the priests dictated,
And on religion, they traded.
In many unscrupulous ways,
They all amassed riches.
In exploiting their followers,
They were totally irreligious.
They performed those rituals,
Which were so meaningless,
Like killing dumb animals,
As part of cruel sacrifices.
Righteousness was nowhere.
Degeneration was everywhere.
In this irreligious background,
The priest-craft well flourished.
When the virtue subsides
And the vice prevails,
Himself, God descends,
Or messengers, He sends.
To set right this disorder,
There came a reformer,
As Godsend messenger
To spread love everywhere.
For this divine reason,
Although out of season,
To indicate his arrival sign,
There fell a gentle rain.
The flowers bloomed well,
Spreading delicious smell,
That filled the air around,
As one more sign, it was found.
In this holy atmosphere,
Amidst joy everywhere,
Gautama Buddha was born,
As a Savior from the heaven.
