Beyond the long and often lonely wait,
Beset  by urges strange from deep within
Pulsate demands to culminate
In Motherhood
The gasping presence fights with strength supreme,
And bursting bonds of month-long celled restraint
Brings birth power, awesome yet serene
To Motherhood
Wakes new a love unique, and all=consumes
The momentary fret at life's emerge.
Repays with joy in hearts attuned
With Motherhood.
Never cell so warm or sweet the chains
Of jailor's irresistable commands.
Crying everlasting claims
On Motherhood.
Offspring of love, and herald of yet more.
Bequething back inherited content.
Open wide this most rewarding door
Of Motherhood.
