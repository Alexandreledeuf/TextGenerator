The dark hour.
Pitch black.
The night sparks,
with sudden stars.
With a glory unattained,
the night-shroud whispers
to the tumultuous ocean,
a longing unknown.
Breaks from the unfathomable darkness,
chaos of a roaring dawn.
stamping its thump
in this lonely night sky.
An endeavour
to sweep the earth off its feet.
Leaps of joy,
in the boundless ocean.
the cumulative sorrow, a burden unshed,
smothered in a second.
All that was,
vanishesâ€¦
for all that is, to come.
and thus ends a creation,
to create the uncreated.
