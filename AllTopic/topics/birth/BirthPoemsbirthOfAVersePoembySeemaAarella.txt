In the aqueous placenta
Of Psychological
Feminine vitality,
The shapeless feotus
Of my virgin desire
Begins to materialize
Nourished by the
Quintessential love
Flowing from your verse!
Heart oozes sensuality,
Throbbing emotions,
Pigmented with Passion.
Infantile Stumbling
In my composition
Of Illegible words,
And I recline in your
Adoring arms
To learn loveâ€™s first alphabets!
