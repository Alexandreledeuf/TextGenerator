we may be the same in face and needs
but! i am different in value and deeds.
while you love to flaunt your looks
i love to sit and read books.
you want to be the center of the crowd.
'i just look at you and frown'
you want to show people that.you are
the better of the twin
because you are happy and carefree.
but this is not what all people see.
there are times in life that
we are alike.
but! we are both seperate individuals
with different personalities.
i believe in the goodness in life
having children and a wife.
while you believe in the party rule.
in my eyes you are such a fool.
when it is time and the lord
calls our name.
will you still feel the same.
we are twins this i can see
but you are not the same as me.
so when you see that it's time for change
i will love you just the same.
