You gave me love,
you breathed life into me.
After I found you,
I've found all hapiness.
Ever since my heart found shelter in your eyes,
I felt as if I really live,
I really exist,
I was a dream,
I've become real for you.
No more grouse I hold agaisnt destiny,
now that I've known you from so close.
Now that I have you,
I've found a world of joy.
In your eyes I have seen myself in this world.
I really live,
I really exist,
I was a dream,
I've become real for you.
I love you
