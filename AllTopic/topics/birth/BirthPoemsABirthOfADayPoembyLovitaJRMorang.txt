… a birth of a day
an endless - gifted
wrapped in maddening passion
to make love to the presence of such enormity of littleness…
moments wanted to be married
but time not yet born…
thirst frozen-steaming cup of coffee
time alive-the clock on the wall dead
so many tomorrows- today has for us
A new moon day …
…in the nights of these -each living…
Dear endless sky-never shall you be walking in the dark
Without the stars-
