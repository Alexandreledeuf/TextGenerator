From The Birth Canal of The Womb
The Lifeblood Flowed and Zoomed
The Umbilical Stretched From The Navel
Twisted, Like Some Undersea Cable
Forty-Two Hours In Hard Labor
The Mother Begged For GOD’s Favor
To Help Deliver This Child
And Please Shorten This Pain Trial
The Enfant Kicked  1 … 2 … 3
So Impatient To Be Set Free
The Woman Was Bent On Being Brave
Until There Came The Next Big Wave
1 … 2 … 3 … Breathe, Breathe
Her Husband Coached So Tenderly
He Could Only Watch Helplessly
… It Humbled Him Mightily
1 … 2 … 3 …  Breathe,  Breathe
Still No Sign From Between Her Knees
1 … 2 … 3 … Push, Push
She Yelled So Loud, She Couldn’t Hush
“Inside, The Child Surged Strongly
It’s As Though, It Fought Knowingly
It Was Now Or Never
To Not Be Prematurely Severed”
1 … 2 … 3 … Push, Push
Finally The Head Began To Gush
One, Two …  and One Big Push
What A Relief and What A Rush!

They Named Their Baby, Bravura
Their Image In A Miniature Mirror
Eight Pounds Of A Cuddly Doll Toy
A Beautiful, Tiny Bundle Of Joy
A Thatch Of Black Curls On Her Head
Yeah, She Got That From Her Dad
Red Splotched Skin Like A Little Tomato
And That’s Her Mama’s Nose, You Know
Smallest fingers and Toes Complete
Yawning Toothless, But Looks So Sweet
But The Breath-Catching Thrill and Prize …
Was The Moment She Opened Her Eyes
And Looked At Mommie As Tho She Knew
She Was Safe and Much Loved Too
Wrapped In A Pink Blanket and Hugs
Daddy Beamed When She Gave Thumb A Tug …
The First Touch With Her Father
Eyes Swam As He Kissed His Daughter
Young Couple Gazed With Fervor
They Reveled In The Birth Of Bravura
Forgotten, Was The Prior Terror
Forgotten Was The Painful Error
They Could Laugh At Any Furor
As They Held Their Baby, Bravura
Proud Parents Of Baby Bravura
Were Determined To Be Good Mentors
Tho’ Doc Said Ischemia Disease
They Just Held Each Other and Squeezed …
The Girl, Was Named Bravura
No Child Could Be Any Dearer
She Held All Their Hopes and Dreams
This Little, Living Precious Being
So Pretty and Such A Darling
Hoped She’d Aspire To Great Things
They Named The Baby …  Bravura
‘Cause Need For Courage Couldn’t Be Any Clearer
