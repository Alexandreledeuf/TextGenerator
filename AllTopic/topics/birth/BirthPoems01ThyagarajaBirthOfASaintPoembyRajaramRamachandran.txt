Witnessed the divine sanction
From the Merciful Heaven
For a great saint, who was born.
It was on the fourth day,
In the month of May,
This saint took his birth
On this mundane earth.
The Temple Town Tiruvarur,
Of the District Thanjavur,
Became the chosen land,
To welcome this child.
True to their own custom
He was given the name
Thyagaraja, the Lord
Of this Temple God.
‘Thyaga, ’ a word for ‘sacrifice’
‘Raja’ for ‘King or Prince, ’
Thyagaraja, as his name stood,
Lived in austerity till his end.
He was the third son,
The most illustrious one,
Of Ramabrahmam, his father,
And Seethamma, his mother.
The King of Thanjavur
Patronized his father,
A story teller by profession,
And an exponent of Ramayan.
As a daughter of a Veena player,
Kalahastayya, a royal court performer,
Music was in Seethamma's blood
And he grew up in this background.
