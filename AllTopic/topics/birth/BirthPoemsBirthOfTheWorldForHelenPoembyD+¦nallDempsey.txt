It was quiet
as bone.
I felt I was
in a cage.
I was a curve
lost in space
not thinking
thinking of nothing
in particular
or perhaps 'Man...
I so want to be
outta here! '
Next minute
I was being
fashioned into
WOMAN.
My own
person
no longer just
part of him.
Even God had to admit
I was an immense
improvement
(I think he fancied
me himself)
on old Adam.
I thought the world
was my oyster
sent out for
some Chinese
spare ribs
smoothered in a black bean sauce.
Then I got on
with the business
of making
the world.
