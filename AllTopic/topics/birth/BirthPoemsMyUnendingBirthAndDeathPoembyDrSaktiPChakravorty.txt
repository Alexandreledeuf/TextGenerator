MY UNENDING BIRTH AND DEATH
esspeecee… 27.10.96.
Birth,
Death-
I take:
In million ways,
In million forms,
In million places,
In million times.
Born:
As aquatic,
Thousand leagues under-
Serene Sea bed.
Born:
As bacteria, parasite,
A vexing guest-
In living flesh.
Born:
As plants,
In cozy darkness-
Rooted deep under earth.
Born:
As Homo sapiens,
In the snug shelter-
Mothers’ womb.
Born and die-
In mega form,
In micro form,
And in every shape
and size,
Imaginable,
Unimaginable,
Tangible,
Intangible,
Cognizable,
In-cognizable and so on…
I born and die
Every second,
In infinitesimal
Fraction of time.
Time fails
To restrict me.
I rejoice
The ‘Omni-Oneness’
Both in
Ecstasy of birth,
Dulcet of death.
Know well
Destined to
Die and born
Again and again,
In unending cycle
In ever new cycle.
