How long can stay the happiness?
How long can stay the sadness?
Nothing in this world can go always up
Nothing in this world can go only down.
Nothing in this world remains the same forever.
As the day changes to night,
And the night changes to day.
As the cold changes to warm,
and warm changes to cold.
As this natural law always changes everything,
up to down and down to up.
So long as there is nothing without an opposite, smile...
The Death will change to Birth!
