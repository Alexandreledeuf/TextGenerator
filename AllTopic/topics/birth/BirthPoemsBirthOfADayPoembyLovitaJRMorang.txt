… birth of a day
An endlessness, gifted:
maddening passion
wrapped in blue, red and green
to make love to the  enormity of littleness…[]
moments wanted to be married  [moments which…]
but time not yet born…
thirst frozen-steaming cup of coffee
time alive-the clock on the wall dead
so many tomorrows- today has for us
A new moon day …
…in the nights of these -each living…
Dear endless sky-never shall you be walking in the dark
Without the stars-
…so far gone…
…still the fragrance from the empty bottle of perfume lingering in and around
Wherever I go…
