a prisoner
of my own wish,
for loneliness.
my soul seperates
to another world,
when myraid thoughts,
make entry,
into my mind.
spearing through
in fast speed,
an idea promptly
developing,
into a poem.
at other times,
all my thoughts,
form into a knotted ball,
and fall into,
a dark abyss
of blackness.
but when i climb,
the staircase of darkness
suddenly a light reveals
to show me, that
i belong to another world
and a new poem is born.
