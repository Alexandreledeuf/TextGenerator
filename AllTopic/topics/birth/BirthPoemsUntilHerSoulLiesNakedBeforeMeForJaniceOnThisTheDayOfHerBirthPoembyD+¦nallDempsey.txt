I celebrate
my lover's birthday
glorying in her
body
ravishing her senses
(she relishing my ravishing)
until her soul
lies naked before me
I making her anew
shaping her molecule by molecule
touch upon touch
creating her
kiss by kiss
until she exists
clothed in my love
dressed in her joy
this day of her
birth.
