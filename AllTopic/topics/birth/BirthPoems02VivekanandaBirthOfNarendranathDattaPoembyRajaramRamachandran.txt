(Born on 12-1-1863)
The Land of Bengal is famous
For all kinds of noble causes,
Affecting social, political, religious,
Arts, cultural and trade interests.
In all these fields, there arose
Great many reformers, leaders,
Artists, poets, entrepreneurs,
As the top most sons of its soils.
As the heart of Indian Nation,
It rose up to all the occasions,
With its mighty contributions,
In the nation building functions.
Its abundant natural resources,
The perennial flow of rivers,
The deep sea coastal borders,
They added to its rich treasures.
As God’s gift, this mother soil
Gave birth to a great soul,
Narendranath Datta by name,
Later Vivekananda, he became.
In the year eighteen sixty three,
On the twelfth day of January,
He was born at Calcutta,
Now known as Kolkata.
Bhuvaneswari Devi, his mother,
Viswanath Datta, his father,
Both were proud of this son
For his nature more divine.
Lord Siva of Varanasi came,
Once in his mother’s dream,
Granting her wishful boon,
“I’ll be your son soon.”
True to her dream, her son
Proved himself more divine
In his every word and action,
That enhanced his reputation.
