Agnostics, Atheists and Bitter-Hearts
Beware of Belittling He, of The Highest Courts
He Is Not One To  Mess With, Or To Be Mocked
In His  Hand, Is The Key, To Your Own-Death-Lock …
Now, If You’re One To Say, “Oh, I Had A Good-Run
I’ve Had Fun, and Now, If It’s Done … It’s Done”
And If You Are Ready To Leave, When His Kingdom Comes …
You Won’t Mind, Your Last Breath, Blown To Oblivion
