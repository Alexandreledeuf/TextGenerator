A man should have respect
His case may not accord him that,
Nor his situation
Yet he must feel self worth.
A man must have respect
He may be poor
And destitute
But he is a child of God.
He is a spark of the Spirit
He is a wonder in himself
He is unique
The greatest of animals.
A man will have respect
Primordiality may refuse him it
But he will strive all he may
To clinch it still.
