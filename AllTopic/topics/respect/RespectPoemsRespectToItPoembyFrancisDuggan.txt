Respect to it has more than a one sided way
Do not expect the respect of others if respect to them you don't pay
You treat other people as you'd like them to treat you
And in turn they will give you the respect you are due
You may be the wealthiest and most powerful person in your town
And you feel that you have the right for to put others down
And others respect you or so to you it does appear
But between feigned and true respect the difference is quite clear
Despotic leaders believe the masses them do revere
But this sort of feigned adulation is adulation through fear
To protest in such circumstance they'd be risking their own lives
And the lives of their children as well as their wives
If you do not respect then respect do not expect to receive
Just a known fact of life that one ought to believe.
