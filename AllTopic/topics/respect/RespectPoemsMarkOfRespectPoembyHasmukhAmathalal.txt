Women need it as mark of respect
We all have to think seriously and introspect
When God has made it then why do we stand as suspect?
Has everything got relevance with cast, creed, color or sect?
Yes, color do attract us for certain reasons
It is natural and varies from person to person
But is it the only criteria to hate an individual?
Still we have we to fight against role called dubious or dual?
I salute to those who stand against such move?
They may be threatened with their live or removed
Yet the fight may not be over till it ends
We as an human beings must change our trend
We are in land of peace and liberty
We are equally blessed with freedom from almighty
Why do we create hatred only on the basis of color?
This is not simple matter but serious and major
Some of the people may not speak openly against
But secretly they will bless and insist
That struggle rages on indefinitely
The people are brandished and disappear quietly
It is suppression and blot on humanity
It is not even today discouraged for continuity
Enough blood has been shed and still it remains
Let us do everything which is possible in our domain
