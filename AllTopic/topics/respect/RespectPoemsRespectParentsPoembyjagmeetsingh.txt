RESPECT YOUR MOM AND DAD;
IF NOT, THEN YOUR FUTURE WILL BE BAD.
AND YOU WILL ALWAYS REMAIN SAD.
YOU GIVE RESPECT, THEY WILL GIVE YOU BLESSINGS;
AND YOU WILL BECOME THE KING.
THIS IS THE FACT;
NOW, IF YOU WILL NEGLECT;
AND DON'T GIVE THEM RESPECT;
THEN AFTER SOME TIME YOU WILL REGRET.
THEY CAN BE YOUNG OR OLD;
AND THEY ALWAYS CARRY YOUR LOAD.
SO, WE SHOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT
THEY ARE OUR SECOND GOD.
YOU CAN BE SIKH, HINDU, MUSLIM OR JAIN;
FIRSTLY YOU SHOULD BE A GOOD MAN.
