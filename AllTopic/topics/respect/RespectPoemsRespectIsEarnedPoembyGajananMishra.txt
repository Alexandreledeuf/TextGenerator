Respect is earned
Respect is given
Respect is not demanded
Respect is not forced
To give others respect
Is our tradition our culture
My dear, forget not
As you sow so you reap
Go on your own trip
The engine of respect
You see it is auto
Never bother who says what
You say whatever you like
As freedom of speech is there .
