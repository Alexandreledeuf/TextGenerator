The youth of today but not all I may say,
have no integrity or moral principles.
They have no qualms about who they insult
whether it be their parents or another adult.
Respect has gone out of the window
it is no longer here. It meant something
in our lifetime we held it very dear.
No-one gives up their seat to  elderly
people anymore, what does it matter
old woman if your feet are sore.
They shun and ignore the older generation
as though they were not there.
they don’t give a damn they really don’t care.
They won’t be so belligerent and bold,
When they too  eventually grow old.
Maybe they too will look back  with sadness
by their actions, and their disgrace.
for making the world a poorer place.
And respect will stay a spectre of the past,
my god, what a pity it did not last.
