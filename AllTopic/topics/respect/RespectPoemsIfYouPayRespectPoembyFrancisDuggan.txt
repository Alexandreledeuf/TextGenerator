If you pay respect to where respect is due
And to your own higher self try to remain true
And treat everyone as an equal and all as the same
Your's ought to live on as a remembered name.
If for everyone you believe on a 'fair go'
And despite their Race or Creed due respect to them show
And never ruin anyone's character with malicious lies
Above the ordinary you are one who does seem to rise.
If you unlike many not addicted to greed
And try to help those of help who are in need
And of your own Human flaws you do feel aware
To say the least people like you are quite rare.
If you do believe in the live and let live
And you are not too proud to receive and generous enough for to give
And respect to the rights of all others you pay
Then as a person you are doing quite okay.
