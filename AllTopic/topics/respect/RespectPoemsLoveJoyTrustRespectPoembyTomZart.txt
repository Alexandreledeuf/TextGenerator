We must bravely reject the deeds of the wicked
Which offer nothing but false pleasures and tears.
The Devil serves up his lies of mistrust
Plotting we'll remain prisoners of our fears.
When we fail to submit to the will of God
We pay attention to all the wrong voices.
We fall prey to deception and refuse to obey
The Lord's love to improve our choices
God's wisdom is measured by the outcomes of life
And how we keep our desires and untruths in check.
If we excuse our wrongs and always blame others
We suffer the loss of love, joy, trust and respect
