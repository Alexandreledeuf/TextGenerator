I would love to be hated
For ever reason and stand related
Each action being criticized
And cut to size
That shall give me enormous joy
Nice reason  to feel elated and enjoy
At least you near to the people
For what ever cause and trouble
They will call you man of vested interest
Try to malign motive behind and test
They want simple excuse to air dissent
They have actually lost civility and curtsey is absent
I am sure of great respect
When they will know about my act
The work put behind success
And providing them best window with access
With such intention, any man can work freely
He has the platform and vast horizon readily
He can go for in and utilize the space
As has good intention show class in chase
