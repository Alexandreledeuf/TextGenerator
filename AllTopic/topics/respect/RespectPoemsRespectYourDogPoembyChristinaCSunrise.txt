Respect Your Dog
Dogs have feelings like everyone else,
people treat them badly,
thinking they are beneath us.
Dogs help us spiritually, but people can’t see,
how they hurt man’s best friend dearly.
Now what species would leave its pack,
Live with another, be loyal and watch its back?
Dog is the sacrifice to save your life,
when wolf eats your dog,
you are only hurt
like an arm that’s been knifed.
Need I say more
to defend dogs galore?
