Respect each peer
Respect each foe more
Attributes stand next to your conscience’s core
Respect each night
Respect each day
Actions reveal your character in every way
Respect each creature
Respect each beast
Trust unveils truth hidden behind nature’s mist
Respect each cloud
Respect each grain of sand
Mercy will offer you her helping hand
Respect each color
Respect each race
Equality speaks only of mercy and grace
Respect each river
Respect each pond
Mother Nature conveys her great wonders and beyond
Walk into each day,
With your heart soaked in hope and joy
As day fades and night endures
Respect will never destroy
