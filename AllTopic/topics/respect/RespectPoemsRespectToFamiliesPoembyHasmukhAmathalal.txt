Some people die unsung
Even with heroic record nothing is sung
People forget their sacrifice
Even state fails to honor the promise
Dependent families run door to door
They helplessly watch and think about neighbor
They look at far distant sky
With only one questioning mind, why?
What drives people to sacrifice?
For motherland with simple advice
“Die for honorable cause and attain heaven”
Does this sentence make sense even?
The state suffers attitude
It looses the magnitude
The cause is lost in wilderness
People resent sacrifice and painfully face
All talks of honor becomes joke
The valor is lost behind thick smoke
No youth now prefers defense job
As their fair name is deliberately robbed
Give some respect to families
They want no mercy
Give them due share
Do not give them frightening stare
