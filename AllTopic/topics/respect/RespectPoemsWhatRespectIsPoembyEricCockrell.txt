have we forgotten
what respect is?
did we ever really know?
every human being deserves
the respect of every other human being,
and should respect every other
human being as well!
it has nothing to do with
color, religion, political views,
or financial status!
respect is a God given right,
and responsibility!
respect is about being human.
treat people the way you wish to
be treated... treat people like people!
