respect!
for all that lives,
for all that breathes...
for life itself in all
its constantly evolving forms....
for every moment,
for every casual brush
of a caring hand...
for the individuality and
the differences...
for in the differences
we find sameness!
not to change
a rainbow to
a mountain...
a hawk into
a turtle....
but to take each
as it is... realizing
its beauty and its worth....
respect!
knowing that what you feel,
i feel... what you need,
i need...
one breath of life,
many forms,
molded by the spirit
of compassionate energy!
respect!
