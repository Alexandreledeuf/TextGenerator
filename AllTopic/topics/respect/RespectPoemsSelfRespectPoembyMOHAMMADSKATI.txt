Respect defines itself                                                By itself for itself anytime, but                                     Self-respect is another world of respect                              Simply because it means that someone                                  Respects himself and by doing this                                    He respects others fully...                                          Without that is called self-respect term, then                        The whole life will be turned up-side-down...                        We love to respect,                                                  We love to be respected anytime, and                                  Self-respect completes respect itself                                 Until the last moment...                                             Life has no meaning without                                           That respect or that self-respect anytime...                         _________________________________________________ _____________________
