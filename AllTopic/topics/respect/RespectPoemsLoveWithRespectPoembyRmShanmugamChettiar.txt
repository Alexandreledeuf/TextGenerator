Love gives comfort; respect gives courage.
Love sedates one and respect inspires.
Love lulls you and respect awakes you.
You canâ€™t demand love but command respect.
Love with respect or respect with love
Is what people, be high or low, expect
From those outside their family circle.
There only exist human relations.
