Why do you think I am not like you?
I know I can drink and do what you can do.
I need to be a human for once in my life
I'm not the kind of person who always holds a knife.
I want to be naive like much people
I don't want to be a thief and disagreeable.
I want to be a star that twinkles in the sky
I want to be the truth that people always deny.
I want to be a good evidence in this deceitful world
And make the insensible people know that there's a lord.
A lord of fairness, kindness and safety
So people go out from from your cavity.
I need an answer for my serious call
To feel at least I am human who have a soul.
