Nobody gives a damn about you
Until you pick up a gun or strap on a bomb
And kill someone with your version of kindness
Nobody gives a damn about you
Until you have a couple too many drinks
Get behind the wheel of your SUV
And kill someone with your version of having fun
Nobody gives a damn about you
Until you call someone a Honky or a Nigger
And kill someone with your version of the truth
Nobody gives a damn about you
Until you learn to give a damn about yourself
