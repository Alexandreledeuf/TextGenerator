Oh, all dear men;
Young, adult and old.
You have given us the freedom
To study whatever we want;
But are we contended? No,
Our tender heart craves for your love and respect.
You have given us the freedom
To work where ever we want;
But are we happy? No,
Our tender heart craves for your love and respect.
You have given us the liberty
To talk whatever - equalityâ€¦.;
But do we feel good? No,
Our thoughtful mind longs your love and respect.
You have given us the liberty
To wear whatever we like;
But are we relieved? No,
Our thoughtful mind longs your love and respect.
You have given us the autonomy
To go anywhere;
But do we feel safe alone? No,
Our lonely body needs your love and respect.
You have given us the sovereignty
To say, do whatever we want;
But do any of those things make us
Really happy and peaceful? Never,
Our eternal soul yearn for your love and respect
More than anything else!
