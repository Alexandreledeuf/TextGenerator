What to expect?
Dirty dust under my feet.
Am I a cheat?
I am holding your hands
I am touching your forehead
I am in front of your eyes
I am a flower in the garland You wear.
Tell me, tell me, who am I
And You are in equanimity
With new clothes every moment
Taking me upwards with and without my consent.
All these are here not for the sake of show
I realized and you called me loudly
I want to sacrifice myself for You
And You are declaring my victory at the end.
What to do with that victory
That I do not know and I am sure
I know not the beginning and the end
And in the middle I am in my life threefold.
