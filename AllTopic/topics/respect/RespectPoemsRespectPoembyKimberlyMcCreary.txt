LORD, teach us to hace and show respect for each other each day,
Patience and kindness to listen to what others have to say.
We all have a need to turn to others at times,
Teach us to have enough respect to reach out, and not act blind.
Teach us to respect that others can teach us things in life as we walk,
Teach us to respect good criticism to us as with others we talk.
LORD just teach us to in all things to respect and show love each day,
That is what we ask you today as we pray.
