First a great relationship is about two things, first,
Find out the similarities and second, respect the differences.
Respect is a two-way street, if you want to get it you have to give it
I have found if you respect yourself others will respect you
The secret of a happy life is respect.
Respect for yourself and respect for others
Love is honesty. Love is a mutual respect for one another
This generation has lost the true meaning of romance.
There are so many songs that disrespect women.
You can’t treat the woman you love as a piece of meat.
You should treat your love like a princess.
Give her love songs, something with real meaning.
Maybe I’m old fashioned but to respect the woman you love should be a priority.
Love is honesty. Love is a mutual respect for one another
And respect for ourselves guides our morals
Respect for others guides our manners
Two people can only live as one when each is prepared to give
And receive trust and understanding.
Above tha, t lies respect.
Without respect for how the other feels, no marriage is worthwhile
I respect another man’s religion, or color or creed.
I respect, and follow, the will of my maker.
I respect, the truth, no matter how unpopular.
I respect a good work ethic.
I respect the values on which this country was founded.
I respect, those who would champion the under privileged.
I respect those of differences, who seek common ground.
I respect those faithful to principal.
I respect, change, that is for the better.
I respect an honest day’s work.
I respect the great talents of the entertainment world.
I respect, thought provoking works, of the written word.
I respect the unquenchable thirst of creativity.
I respect the farmers and workers that toil in the field.
I respect the good in man.
I respect the virtue in woman.
I respect the innocence of children.
I respect the generosity of mankind.
Most of all I respect the maker of
life and the love, that each of us have within us.
