I respect
The act
Of each Individual
When he tries to be noble
What is his secret strength?
The belief
That provides relief
With not buts and ifs
I bow down
To such known
And unknown
Persons
They may be visiting
And reciting
Enchanting with prayers
To wish as peace seekers
When you knell down
Your ills become known
They are washed away
The moment you pray
My heart beats for those
Who repose
Trust and confidence
With almighty for peace essence
