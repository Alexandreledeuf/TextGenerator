Give respect to a woman
Your mother your sister
Your daughter are there
In a woman.
Give respect to a woman
A woman is your wife
And producing your children
With much difficulties
And rearing them
Sacrificing everything
Giving you pleasure
At life's risk.
Give respect to a woman
A woman is a woman
You men can not describe
A woman being the product
Of a woman
You just give respect
And beg excuse
I know wrong is with you.
