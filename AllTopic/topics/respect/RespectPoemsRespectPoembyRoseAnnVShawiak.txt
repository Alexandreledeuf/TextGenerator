All the diversity groups in the world won't help any situation.
One solution is getting to know one another, then deciding whether or not we like a person for who they are.
It's a way to combat what some see as racism.
We're not meant to like everyone we meet and that's okay.
Live and let live, and respect the fact that we can't all get along.
That's what makes the world unique and diverse.
Trying to make people fit some preconceived idea of a few people is totally absurd and asinine.
Leave people alone, go your own way, find your own place in life and don't expect others to follow your pathway.
