Many of this world face heartbreak and failure
Broken homes, joblessness, loneliness, loss and war.
Even Godâ€™s disciples had to battle doubt and depression
As Jesus and Satan shadowed every window and door.
Throughout life we experience regret, fear and longings
While seeking love, fame, sex, revenue, and romance.
Most learn the hard way how to behave and relate
To become all that we are by servitude and chance.
God blesses those who triumph through faithfulness and love
By the way they provide, treasure and protect.
All of us suffer issues, weaknesses and shortcomings
As we celebrate life, love, Jesus, faith and respect.
