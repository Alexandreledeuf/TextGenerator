I am simple and ordinary
But poet and good at oratory
I write in simple way
No show off or employ any other way
I find light all around
As you were found
From the crowd
To claim loud
It was rare occasion
When I proposed for relation
You were straight forward
Took me near with true words
You are exceptional
Approach too very rationale
No show off or over imposition
You are Pak* friend suited for union
I am not in this world
When chatting with cold
Soul who is whispering slowly
Leaving in between abruptly
Yes I too respect
And act
With honor
That shall be due to lover
What shall ask her?
To shed fear
And come near
I think simple address of "dear"
