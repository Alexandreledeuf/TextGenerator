If You respect yourself respect to others you'll show
Never judge a person that you do not know
But your political leaders feel free to praise or to criticize
Since their decisions impact on you that you must realize
If you so wish you can heed or ignore my advice
Those with only personal power leave to their own device
Since any personal decisions they make do not impact on you
As you'd like them to treat you likewise to them do
Anyone if they so choose with their words can be unkind
And if you look for flaws in others then flaws you will find
Those kind with their words to their higher selves true
We receive from life what is only our due
Those into trash talking I for one don't condone
Let the one without sin come and cast the first stone.
