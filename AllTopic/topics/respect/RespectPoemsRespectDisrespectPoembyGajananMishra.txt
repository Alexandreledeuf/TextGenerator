It is all
But relative
And no way
Connected with me.
One should learn
How to respect others
One should know
He has no right
To disrespect others.
It is true
I am not unselfish,
To certain extend
I have to compromise
With the right of others.
I know I am
No way connected
With action and
With the fruits there of.
But I am here,
And I will be here
Before you, my dear
And it all depends
On your visual capacity.
What is there
To renounce
That I do not know
You are seeing all
At this moment
On the next moment
All these are not here
What to say about others
When I am not mine here.
