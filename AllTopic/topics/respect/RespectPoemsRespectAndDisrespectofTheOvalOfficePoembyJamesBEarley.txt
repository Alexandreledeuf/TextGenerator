Obama...has his critics
..God knows I'm one
I've also reaped benefits
God knows there's some
But to claim..I've not
Is hypocritically wrong
Still that bigoted mentality
...Steadfast...clings on
In the minds of the many
….Twisted and such
Tormented….demented
Souls out of touch
Though facts of the moment
Stare dead in the face
…Yet reality's delusion
Remains commonplace
..Indeed rising as one
Sanctimonious voice
...Savoring policies..
Cherry-pick choice
…..All said and done
Suggest the bigoted mind
...And hypocrisy's child..
Simply both…..of a kind
