My grandma knew a thing or two
about the herbs that freely grew
From which she brewed her remedies
that served to cure a cough or wheeze.
She always said for each disease.
There was herb which would bring ease.
The local village doctor knew
that she knew more than he claimed to
. Before the N.H.S. became
the major player in the game.
They cured the ills of every man,
the wise old doctor and My Gran
Each held the other in respect
a partnership both could accept.
