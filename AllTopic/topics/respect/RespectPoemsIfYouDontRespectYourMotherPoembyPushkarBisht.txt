If you don’t respect your mother,
Your whole knowledge
Will turn into soil,
And you only become a man
Of bones not soul
Where will you go in the long run?
When your mother does not
Remain with you any longer,
And the whole world burns
You with its fire,
Then who will save you,
From the fire of the world?
Your destruction waits for you,
And your progress ceases
In the mid way,
And you are struggling with yourself,
Oh, you remain alone,
Not even the soul is left,
And the shoulder you don’t have to cry on,
But the frustration hugs you
Wherever you go in life
How poor you have become,
In blessings,
And a bad lot hovering
Around you all the times,
Then how will you escape?
If nothing is left with you,
Don’t forget the last option
Remains with you,
You better go to your mother
And ask her for sorry
Then the heaven is with you
To protect from devil’s shadow
