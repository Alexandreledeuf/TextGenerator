Respect is what you earn not command
That is something some find hard to understand
You earn respect if respect you do show
From people in your life you've come to know
Of Respect or lack of we do read of and hear
Though 'tis a thing that cannot be born of fear
Of somebody who has power over you
In your feigned respect your feelings are not true.
Many may respect and admire the high achievers of the town
And applaud them on their journey to renown
But with the many some do disagree
Through different eyes we see things differently.
Respect is something you can only show
For one that you feel privileged for to know
And of any shackles true respect is free
That's how it is and that's how 'twill always be.
