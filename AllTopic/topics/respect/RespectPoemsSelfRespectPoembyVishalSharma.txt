When sun is above the horizon
and, the light it spreads reaches our eye
we forget the darkness, and think ourselves be blessed
Sun's power to light the glory world is self respect.
When rain enters our rooftop,
it doesnt ask whether you are rich or poor
the melody of the sweetness is for everybody
you may call it the rains self respect.
Wonderful stars are there in our sky
and they twinkle to make the sky looks like in a wedding gown
and, its sweetness is preserved in the fairy tales,
thats the self respect that the stars have.
when I mingled to write down a poetry,
thinking it to be my only work supported by my passion,
the happiness I get after make people smile,
thats certainly the self respect I give to myself.
