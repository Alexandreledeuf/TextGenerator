You don't have to love me
You don't have to like me
You don't even have to shine a smile at me,
everytime that you see me.
You don't have to give a hug.
You don't have to 'show some love'
You don't have to smack my back,
like a flyswatter to a bug.
You don't have to pass me by.
You don't have to greet me w/ a cheery lie.
You just need to know one thing.
Remember it like nothing else:
THAT IM NOT LOOKING FOR YOUR BEST,
I JUST NEED YOU TO GIVE ME RESPECT!
