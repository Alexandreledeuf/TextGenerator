Respect, respect me, I say
In every single way
Respect me day by day
Don’t put me down
When we are out and about with people around
Playing me like a fool
Portraying me as one who never went to school
Respect me sweet heart
Till life sets us apart
Respect my needs
Listen and take heed
Respect to me is what means love
And not those commonly spoken words,
‘I love you’
To respect me is to publicly and privately honour me
To respect me is to listen attentively while I speak
To respect me is to bread and butter my desire to be free
To respect me is to stand by me when I am weak
Look up! Look up to me!
I may not be perfect
Nor a genius of an intellect
Respect, respect me & our love will stand erect!
