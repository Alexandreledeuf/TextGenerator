Do not time respect
seasoned age because
someone is now old
show sincere respect to all
but respect most
motivation and heart
of people worthy
of matured respect.
Show courtesy respect
to all suffering humanity
polite considerate conduct
in face of flood adversity
who knows true history
each soul life endured suffers
hurt response to hostilities
only God perceives accurately.
