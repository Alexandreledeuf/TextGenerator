Respect to the ballas on the court today.
Respect to the playas who listen to what we say.
Respect to the game for it isn't quite done.
Respect for all the athletes who did it for fun.
Respect all that try even though it's hard.
Respect to those who keep trying despite the scars.
Respect goes a long way, the harder they try.
Respect to the legends who will never die.
