Entering into somebody's house,
Scare while one goes into,
Scare while one returns from,
Scare while one is enjoying the desire,
Scare while one is trying to hide his activities from others;
While there is fear and scare forever,
why one does not consider the  risk
of  entering into somebody's house,
of desirous to have contact with somebody's wife
and lose the respect and reputation?
There is always fear of
Sexually Transmitted Disease,
Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) ,
Beware of your activity!
