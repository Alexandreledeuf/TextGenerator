Respect another's wife
As your own mother
Treat another's possessions
As lump of dirt and spit
On it, my dear.
Think all other living creatures
As you would yourself
If you are learned, my dear.
Don't be envious and
Mischievous, my dear
You are condemned
By the laws of nature.
Don't do that makes your soul goes to hell
Don't make your body fit to be eaten by vultures.
