We have forgotten traditional values
That was owed and very much due
He teachers were considered as founding stone
For the future of students alone
Even though the basic knowledge was from home
The teachers were always welcome
And adored their position
It was respectable transition
It may be with lack of facility
That student might have faced in its utility
The teachers have gone all out
To help in every aspect and talked about
The teachers were always held
In high esteem but were less paid
Still they have performed their duties
To the help and welfare of societies
We naturally held high regard
And look forward
For heir guidance and advice
It is always full of promises
