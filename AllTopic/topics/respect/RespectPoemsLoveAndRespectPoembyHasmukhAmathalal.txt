Love and respect
Each face with fact
That it has been blessed
By almighty and shaped
Let the white color be liked
Let the black color be disliked
God has made no difference
It has shown equal presence
If day is bright with sun
It has challenges to run
White means sacrifice and peace
Life is full of danger and not at all at ease
If nights are totally dark
They have so much to spark
Offer peace and calm
To offer you rest with no harm
See the purpose and motives
He has always remained selective
Provided us with two options
Either go for it or disown
If you love both with same eyes
You need not think more and try
The heavenly bodies are there to look after
You finish the mission and depart thereafter
