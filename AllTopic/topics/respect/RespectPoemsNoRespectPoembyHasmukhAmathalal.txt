People stay
Away
And pay
Scant respect
To beggars
Who stay not near?
But far from civilized world
To have their own fold
They know
And blow
With wind
And not mind
Someday some change
May come in with time edge
Who knows what may be swept away?
The fortune, wealth or greedy way
No world for beggars
No words for poor
But look backward
And then think forward
Patience they have
And silently behave too
With insult
And deep restraint
