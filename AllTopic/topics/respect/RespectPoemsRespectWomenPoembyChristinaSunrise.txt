Respect women for they bring a lot into this world
they are just more than procreators bringing in girl or a little boy.
They are the caregivers, the nurturers, and have a gentle touch
do respect feminine energy and honor it more than a bunch.
Don't abuse women no longer on this planet so dear
by being disrespectful like slapping them on the rear.
How disrespectful can that be?
It shows the person who does it has no respect or integrity.
