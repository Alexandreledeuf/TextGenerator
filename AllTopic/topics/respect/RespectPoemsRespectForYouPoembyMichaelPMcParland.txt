I have respect for you
in so many different ways.
Your fire and your passion,
your kindness and your love,
your strength to fight through all the pain.
I openly admire you for your
determined honest ways.
I respect you for having
given me so much of your
patience and precious time.
The second chances when I have
screwed up like a foolish child.
I respect that you've taken all the time
to truly get to know me.
Broken through and down so many walls
that so many others never had the
courage to even try and climb.
I love and respect you for understanding
why the walls were there foe such a long time.
I respect and admire your rock hard
perseverance in the face of hate and doubt.
I truly can't tell you all the ways
I respect and love you for there's too
much there to count.
Just know that I love you dear,
respect you and hold you as a hero
that I so admire and who's loving
dedication and confidence I look to and aspire.
