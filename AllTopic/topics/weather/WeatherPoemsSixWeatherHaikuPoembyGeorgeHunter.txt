A beautiful day
Sun’s shining, birds are singing
God’s in his heaven.
Pouring rain today
A good thing to wash away
The sins of the world.
It’s snowing outside
Little white flakes floating down
Blanketing the world.
Snow falling on me
Anesthetizing my pain
Pristine flakes from sky.
High winds are blowing
Papers swirling down the road
Hold onto your hat.
Very dark tonight
It’s the story of my life
There’s no moon at all.
