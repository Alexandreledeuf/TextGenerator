It rained and drenched the waiting night,
Heavy torrents did it pour;
Next morning, all was clean and bright,
I could not ask for more.
The sky was baby powder blue,
the clouds had slipped away;
Sunlight deigned to shine on cue,
a refeshing brand new day.
I almost skipped onto the street,
this day felt new, washed clean;
Smiling, as I turned to greet,
the trees, in vibrant green.
The storm had passed at last,
I laughed with sweet relief;
No more skies downcast,
No deary days of grief.
Then suddenly,  I felt a drop,
hit hard upon my cheek;
It hurt as if it wouldn't stop,
It made me feel so weak.
As I turned my face to wince,
the skies turned angry grey;
Clouds gathered with a vengeance,
And the sun just hid away.
Rain burst from the thundering skies,
in a grandiose downpour;
Just like life...I turned my eyes;
Nothing is for sure.
