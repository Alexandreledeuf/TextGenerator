My face falls into my hands,
can't cope any more.
Down the drain went all my plans,
put them in the bottom drawer.
This all might sound hardcore,
but my plan I will not ignore.
I'm gonna pull myself together,
I can conquer any weather.
My plan I dug out again,
going to use my brain.
I am not quite slain,
I will not hang my head in shame.
Any plan is a good plan,
you just got to stick to it.
Hold your head up be a man,
what ever you do don't quit.
