There's an angry rainstorm brewing,
I can feel it in the air;
The pigeons stop their cooing,
to fly out they do not dare.
All the crows have congregated
in the verdant mango tree;
that the seagulls have vacated,
as they fly out to watch the sea.
I sit put inside my alcove,
like a sparrow in her nest;
A ricepearl in a treasure trove,
on a secret singing quest.
And as the rain begins to pelt,
and crash high upon the sea;
I feel my heart begin to melt,
as I sip my cup of tea.
My old white lace curtains billow,
wind-blown sails upon the ships,
Seasprays brine upon my pillow,
blow salty kisses on my lips.
A lightening flash lights up the sky,
like a spotlight in a play;
A thundering roar in prompt reply,
echoes on cue across the bay.
My son climbs into my waiting lap,
His smile keeps me safe and warm;
Under the flannel blanket wrap,
I have my sonshine in the storm!
