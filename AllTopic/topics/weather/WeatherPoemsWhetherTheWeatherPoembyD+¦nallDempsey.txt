I, not
knowing then
that you
would be
my
now
walked by your house
for years
before the years
brought us together
as if
our paths
were blown
together
by the weather
chasing after
your wind-snatched hat
bring it back
tamed in my hand
to be tamed
in turn
by your smile
& the touch of your hand
as I give it
reluctantly
back
unwilling
to let go
of your fingertips
our laughter
lost in a flock
of leaves
throwing themselves
against our bodies
and Time
(that took its time)
seemed now
in a hurry.
We now
forever
comfortable
with this intimacy
your breath
stroking my face with
its thank you.
All as if
weather & leaves
had conspired
to bring us
together
our voices
naked with desire
our footsteps
& shadows
so soon
mingling
into one.
