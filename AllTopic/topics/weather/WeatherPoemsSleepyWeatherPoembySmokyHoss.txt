My dog lay asleep by the window
lost in dreams of drizzle,
I pat her head
and watch the rain descend.
Cold November blows
October forever away,
and here am I, a melancholy warm
sitting with my faithful old friend.
The wind wails
a mournful tune,
a song sung sad
when the sky comes weeping.
The fireplace aglow
holds the heart at home,
as simply contented
I and my old dog, together, lay sleeping.
