Weather and woman
Same and unchanged.
It is your topics
My dear poet
Charles Bukowski.
And I am here
Not so serious reader
On your line
Giving suggestions
Either to go with
The Govt or leave
The land.
O Charles Bukowski,
I have nothing to write
You must admit
And I have to
Fetch the rain
That is running
Through me
Day and night.
