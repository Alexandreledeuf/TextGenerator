I've got you.
You've got me.
And we've got...
Dreams.
I've got you.
You've got me.
And we've got...
Our dreams.
Together we can conquer,
With our dreams.
Together we can make it,
With our dreams.
Together life is better,
With our dreams.
And I've got you.
You know you've got me.
And together...
We've got those dreams.
Oh yes I've got you.
And you've got me.
And we both together will fulfill dreams.
Together we can conquer,
With our dreams.
Together we can make it,
With our dreams.
Together life is better,
With our dreams.
No matter what the weather,
We've got dreams.
Storm winds come blowing...
But no matter what the weather shows,
Together we'll combat it with our dreams.
Storm winds come blowing...

You've got me.
And we've got...
Dreams.
No matter what the weather shows,
Together we will always know...
Together we'll combat it with our dreams.
Together we'll combat it with our dreams.
