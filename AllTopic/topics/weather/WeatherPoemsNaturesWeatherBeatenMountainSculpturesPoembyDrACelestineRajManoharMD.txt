Man chisels, sculpts the mountain-sides by hand;
Man cuts granite blocks off by huge machines;
Man breaks the boulders using dynamite;
The remnants are not worth seeing at all!
When Nature weathers mountains and hill-tops,
In slow degrees for years by crumbling stones,
What’s left appears a master-piece of art –
So queer yet wonderful to human eyes!
A flock of sheep are grazing up a rock;
A crowd of people move to see someone;
Is Jesus preaching from the mountain-side?
The weathered stones appear as if alive!
Imagination can pick various shapes;
The mind’s eye thinks of people present, past;
The thinker views the grotesque shapes anew;
Old mountains turn great sculptures unrivaled!
