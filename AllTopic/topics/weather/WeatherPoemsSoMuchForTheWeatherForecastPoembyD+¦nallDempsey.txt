It was raining
in the kitchen.
“Splish...splash! ”
said my footsteps
enjoying themselves
like never before.
It was like
a swamp.
The butter was swimming
in its blue bowl.
The sugar
had dissolved in its.
The bread was
sodden
and was busy losing
a lot of its breadiness.
Little pieces
of shit
lazily floated from
the cat’s litter.
The sink
had half a sink of rain
in it
as well as last night’s dirty dishes.
The kettle with the lid left off
had filled itself twice.
It had never rained
in the kitchen
...before.
The book left open on page 69
was dying.
The mobile phone
looked like it wasn’t
having an exactly
good time.
The stone
that some kids had thrown
sat on the table
like a king on its throne.
The broken skylight
gathered around it
listening like flunkeys
to everything
the stone
had said.
The birthday cake
lay dead.
The ink
on the letter
wept
copiously
ran
away crying.
Respondez s’il vous plait.
It was raining in the kitchen.
“Damn! ”
we both said
in unison
“Damn! ”
