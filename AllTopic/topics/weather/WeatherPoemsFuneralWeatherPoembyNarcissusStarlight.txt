Walking in the rain
Catching the raindrops
As we laughed in love
Was fun with you, gentle you
But now the dark clouds
Bringing storm and rain
Terrify me
Real funeral weather
As it is today
Pitter patter, pitter patter
The winds have howled and gone
Taking you along
I remember the day you went away
The sky cried tears
Day was dark as night
When the gods took you away
I was alone,
Alone, alone, alone
Crying in the rain
Funeral weather
