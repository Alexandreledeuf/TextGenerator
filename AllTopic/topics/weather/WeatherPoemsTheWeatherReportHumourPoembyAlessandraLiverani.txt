In Sydney today it's 20 degrees centigrade
Humidity is 94% and the light at 6: 21pm will fade
Wind blows from the north east, at 17 kilometres per hour
The moon is waxing gibbous and Monday there's a late shower
On Saturday it'll be mostly sunny, temperature 17 degrees max
Thursday, UV's only moderate, these are the facts
Air pressure is 1012 hpascals, no longer measured in millibars
They use hectos instead of kilos, yes I also thought it quite bizarre
On Sunday there'll be morning clouds, which won't linger in afternoon
They'll drift over to Honiara, maybe take part in a monsoon
Waves will arrive every 7 seconds, be careful, they're head-height
And on Friday,05: 53am is the exact time of first light
Well that's all of the weather captured in verse
You'll have to weather it whether for better or worse
