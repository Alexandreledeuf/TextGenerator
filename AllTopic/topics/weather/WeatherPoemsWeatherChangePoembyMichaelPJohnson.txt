The sun is out but rain’s within
The future looks quite grey
I’ve been informed because of sin
There must be change today
What can I do to make things well?
Outside the weather’s fine
But deep inside I feel like hell
With shivers down my spine
My Christian neighbours seem to cope
I’ve thought it rather odd
But change for me I’ve little hope
Without some help from God
I’m dismal here depressing there
Miserable day and night
There’s little chance that I may share
Of Heaven’s great delight
In life I never learnt to pray
For such I wasn’t keen
To God I don’t know what to say
To church I’ve never been
They say I only need to kneel
Believe that Christ is true
Believe His birth and death were real
And seek His birth anew
Is this the change I’ve heard about?
Is this what must be done?
Even when still I’m plagued with doubt
About God’s risen Son
Is it still right for me to bow?
To pray on bended knee
Asking for change to come right now
For God to set me free
