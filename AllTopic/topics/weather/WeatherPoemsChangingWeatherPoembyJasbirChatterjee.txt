Weather is changing again…
Summer is slowly giving way to winter,
Yellow leaves are falling,
New ones are coming in their place,
Early mornings now have a soft, soothing touch,
The ravaging afternoon sun has cooled down,
Evenings have a crisp, chilly feel
And nights are pleasant with clear, starry skies…
Yes, in a way
This winter will be like the last winter…
But in lots of ways
It will not be like the last one…
New experiences,
New friends,
New sensations,
Fresh insights,
Now light up my way;
And I plod ahead,
With a clearer vision
With a better understanding
of self, of people;
Humming a song
that I had never heard before
A song that has set my pulse racing...
A song that has touched my heart...
