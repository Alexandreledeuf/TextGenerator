Every thing changes
Changes the face of relations
In the markets of exchanging hearts
The much known face changes
Into an unknown like the path
You tread just before the sandy storm
Has any one ever refused to walk
Along with you who comes
In the days of your sorrow
Has any river felt any scarcity of water
In the days of flood?
Then, why the heart of men and women
Changes like the weather of Melbourne?
