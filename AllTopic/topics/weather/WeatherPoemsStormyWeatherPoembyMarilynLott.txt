I love to look at the clouds above
They tell a story, don't you think?
Sometimes they are white and puffy
But can change within a blink
The wind picks up and blows in
Clouds so dark and bold
They almost take your breath away
Unlike the weather channel told
But nevertheless they are interesting
The rain may come pouring down
Get your umbrella ready in case
The weather may change in your town!
