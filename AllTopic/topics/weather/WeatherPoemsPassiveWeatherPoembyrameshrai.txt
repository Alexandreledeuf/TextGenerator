The sun is annoyed with the earth
that so he is not seen throughout
but aroma of his arrival
spreaded throughout the earth
Air is not humming to  - day
stopped mesmerizing the flowers
so, flowers are sad too
not sympathetic with bees even
to sip her nectar today
to view the piteous scene of earth
sky also weeps  with drizzling tears
an unforeseen silence stirs the nature
making me bore except
to lean and chat with my poetry.
