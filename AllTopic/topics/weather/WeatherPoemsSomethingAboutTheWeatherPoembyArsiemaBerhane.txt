Dear sister, you have no idea
About  the weather here
The earth is dry
We haven't seen any rain
For the past few years
And hunger is striking.
Looking out through the window
Father is trying to forecast the weather
And he has been saying something
But no one heard what the exact words are
For he's talking to no one, but himself.
Oh! how terrible things are here
The weather is  bad, so bad that
I am beginning to believe what father has said.
'This is not weather, but a curse laid upon us.'
