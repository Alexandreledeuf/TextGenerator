as i look out the window
i see the sun rise
before my very eyes
i feel its warmth & power upon my face
as i look out the window
i see the rain fall
before my very eyes
i feel its cool calming effect on my soul
as i look out the window
i see the snow fall
before my very eyes
i feel that cold bitterness on my skin
as i look out the window
i see the trees sway
before my very eyes
i feel the love it offers surround me
as i look out the window
i relise that
weather be good, weather be bad
i'm alive
