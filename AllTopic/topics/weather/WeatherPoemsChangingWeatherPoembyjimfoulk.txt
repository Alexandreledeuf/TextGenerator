Do you barely see,
the sun in the sky,
when you know it's very high.
You stand in the sunshine,
and you wonder why,
on a day like today,
you go inside and stay.
When the snow flakes,
come your way
you wished you could
go outside today.
You wait for warm days,
cold is all you get,
making you have a fit.
Finally spring is here,
flowers are blooming,
love this weather, oh so dear.
