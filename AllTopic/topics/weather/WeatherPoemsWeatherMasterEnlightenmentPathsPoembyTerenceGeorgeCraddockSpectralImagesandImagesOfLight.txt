To truly know is to endure raw experiences
to sensitize each momentous moments agonies
to time absorb learn through testing years
residue body mind tested in furnace adversities
impurities burned off in flowing molten streams
finest steal heated beaten into perfection blades
what soul sacrifice can be reborn in phoenix flames?
what soul endure fall not in raging wave ocean agonies?
what soul can weather master enlightenment paths?
