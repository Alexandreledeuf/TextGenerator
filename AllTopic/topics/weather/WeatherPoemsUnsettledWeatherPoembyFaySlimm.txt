Louring heavy skies
Threaten rain.
We must hurry home
Yet again.
Passing scurry-crabs
Seeking caves,
Fleeing to avoid
Powerful waves.
Winging back to roost,
Flurried gulls
Battle to reach cliffs
As it comes.
Harbouring, small boats
Race the storm.
Hoping to be safe
'Til the dawn
Changing fickle wind
Turns about
Then proceeds to die,
And fizzles out.!
