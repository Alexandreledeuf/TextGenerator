There is one thing we can’t avoid
And that, my friend, is weather
It is usually unpredictable
As the clouds began to gather
Or perhaps a puff of wind picks up
And those clouds will blow away
In summer the sun is warm and nice
And we hope that it will stay
But in the winter it’s so different
The clouds help us stay warm
They hover above protectively
Or is there a chance of a storm?
It is really very complicated
That’s why we have those who know
What it all means when suddenly
The winds begin to blow
Rain pours down and it floods
The wind brings a tornado
Hurricane’s can be devastating
So troubling, don’t you think so?
And the snow, oh let me tell you
It can cripple a city over night
It stops everything in its tracks
Blanketing what ever is in sight
The experts spend lots of time
With fancy equipment and such
But since we can’t change a thing
I don’t worry about it too much!
