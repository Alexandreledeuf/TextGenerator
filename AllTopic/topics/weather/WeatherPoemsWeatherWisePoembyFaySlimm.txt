From murky
overcast sky
rife with heavily
laden cold
comes out of nowhere
brightness.
The warm sun's face
pushes holes
through
to reveal cornflower blue
circles of bloom,
bouqueting
the day
Smiles begin
undoing furrowed brows
and start
breaking frowns in two,
increasingly.
From nowhere folk want
to hello
and tension
shows a release.
Murky weather moods
have to go.
