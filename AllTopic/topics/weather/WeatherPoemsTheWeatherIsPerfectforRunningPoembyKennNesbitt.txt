The weather is perfect for running.
I think that I'll go for a jog.
Except I'm a little bit tired,
so maybe I'll just walk the dog.
But he seems too hyper for walking.
He looks kind of hard to control.
So maybe I'll leave him at home,
and go for a leisurely stroll.
But all of my socks are too dirty,
and all of my shoes are untied.
So maybe I'll sit on the front porch.
Or maybe I'll just stay inside.
I see that my kitten is purring,
and wants to curl up on my lap.
It wouldn't be right to prevent her
from getting her afternoon nap.
It's comfortable here on the sofa.
My pillows are cozy and deep.
The weather is perfect for running.
So that's why I'm going to sleep.
