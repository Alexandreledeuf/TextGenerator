Glancing out our western window, toward the Ocean beyond some hills,
I see, near sundown, a layering of assorted clouds, like alternating color spills;
shades of gray this November day, plus white, and some almost resembling amber.
It makes me imagine a playing field over which winged-angels might clamber.
I took some photos to show my wife and now the scene has changed.
A dark gray streak is beside one forest-fire orange.  Clouds are also rearranged.
As more time passes, whatever remnants there were of blue sky disappear,
and light and dark grays and almost-white stand alone……, as sunset is quite near.
