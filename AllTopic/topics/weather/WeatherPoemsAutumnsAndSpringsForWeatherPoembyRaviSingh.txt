Scorching sun may
Push us to stop and turn
In pricking hot sand
Our feet might burn
On our way, we may be
Stopped by twisting hurricanes
And might be troubled
By lashing heavy rains
Winter would be seething
May haunt us with chilling cold
And would try its every trick
To check and keep us in its fold
Every journey has
Its share of hostile weather
We are sure to overcome them
If we try together
We just have to keep the faith
And trust each other
Our journey will have many more
Autumns and Springs for weather
