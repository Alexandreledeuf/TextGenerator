At sea I learned the weather,
At sea I learned to know
That waves raged not forever,
Winds did not ever blow.
I learned that, 'mid the thunder,
Was nothing might avail
But lying to and riding
The storm with scanted sail,
Knowing that calm would follow
Filled full of golden light
Though hail and thunder deafened
The watches of the night.
And, now today I'm sailing
The changing seas no more,
But tied up to a woman
And snug and safe ashore,
With pipe and 'baccy handy
And Sal still loving me -
I tell you that I'm thankful
For things I learned at sea!
