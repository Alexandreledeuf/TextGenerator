There is one thing about Montana
That always fascinates me
It is that from one minute to another
You don’t know what the weather will be
It can be so hot that it seems
You are barely able to breathe
Scorching hot everywhere
Without a single breeze
And then you hadn’t noticed
But a few clouds had drifted in
You look up at the big sky
Not realizing what will begin
But begin it surely does
The wind suddenly blows hard
A few sprinkles are felt at first
On your roof and in your yard
Thunder rolls like bowling balls
Across your heavenly world
A storm like you’ve never seen
Has suddenly been hurled
Yep, it’s always a mystery
As clouds will slowly gather
How things change so quickly
I love the Montana weather!
