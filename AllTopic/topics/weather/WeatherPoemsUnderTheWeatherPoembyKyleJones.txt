The first dark day of summer came sooner than I had hoped,
I took one look at it and just looked back at me
'You're a total wreck' it said
'Wearing a jacket in this overheated hell hole'
'You turned me on in winter' I replied
I walked away from it soon after
'Haven't I gone blind yet I wonder' aloud
but I don't want to see out of my eyes anymore...
Just staring Inside my own soul
Seeing how terrified I've become
Now I've got this sick feeling inside
Whenever it rains, and when it doesn't
The perfect end to a perfect life
But, with nothing on the horizon
I forget about what's above
and All I can think about is what I'm under,
The only thing that ever makes any more sense
