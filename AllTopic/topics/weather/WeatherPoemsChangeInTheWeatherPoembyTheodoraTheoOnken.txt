Sunshine and Roses they make us smile-
As do the soft Springs blossoming trees-
Bringing us total delight-ever so bright...
Happiness can be found in Springs most glorious breeze;
Effervescent are the brooks waters in the glen-
As the BumbleBees pollinate the blooms...
Alas, Springs clouds oft' bring thunder so loud...
And grayer days that just loom with gloom;
But ne'er do these days last for long-
As the Sunshine and Roses return...
Refreshed with soft air-and days so fair...
Leaving no room for a days weather concern;
