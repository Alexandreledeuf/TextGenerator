I think it's the places I've been
or the people I've known,
that led me to find
I'm not alone.
For the first time down this road
it feels like me at summertime.
The eternal gold light within
ready to glitter, willing to shine.
It's a good life some have the luxury to live
drowning in sad song days,
laughing in a hot breeze, at ease,
by a poolside or under palm trees,
with echos that leave voiceless nobody's behind.
But the world was always a beautifully distorted creature, wasn't it?
We are the lucky stars who had a choice,
to do, or not to sharpen the mind.
Like electric diamonds, a spark for dark silhouettes.
I chose to fall, I loved to die,
walking under telephone wires,
pale yellow sun in the sky.
It's so gorgeous to pretend we are all that matters
dancing in your psychedelic souls glow,
waiting for the days to end.
A universal emptiness that has a dream to mend.
T-shirt weather, happiness is better
