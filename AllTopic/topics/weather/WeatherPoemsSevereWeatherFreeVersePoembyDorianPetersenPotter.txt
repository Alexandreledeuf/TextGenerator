The weather has gotten very nasty
And it's causing a lot of heartache.
It's raining dogs and cats!
And tornadoes are leaving just destruction on their wake
The weather conditions are so bad
They're bringing death and making a lot of people sad,
With all the death and disaster they have left just behind
Because of their houses, there's nothing left they can ever find
The severe weather is causing plenty of tornadoes, and floods,
And the wind starts to blow dreadfully, turning the ground below into a chaotic mud.
It's raining dogs and cats!
And tornadoes are leaving just destruction in their wake
Folks might be terrified but they always have a courageous spirit, they are hurting
Right now and in their hearts they are mourning for all they have lost without a warning,
But life continues, some folks will go away, but some come back and start over again,
As life just goes on, rain just stops and the sun will shine again, thru each road and little plain
The weather has gotten very nasty
And it's causing a lot of heartache.
It's raining dogs and cats!
And tornadoes are leaving just destruction on their wake.
