The night sobbed
Her heart-out - near fully,
That is why the day arises happy.
Joyous as a songbird full of mirth
But see how the blackbird is nesting
In some dark shadows girth.
Gazing through - yellow ringed eyes
Her eye - is like the centre
Of a yew tree berry:
It speaks of a defining, terror
When autumn fruits are falling
The call of winter weather!
