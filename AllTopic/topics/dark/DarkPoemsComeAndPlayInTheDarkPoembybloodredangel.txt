Come and play with me it whispers,
Its child like fingers clutching our own,
Come and play my game it pleads,
I will never leave you on your own,
I am not like the rest of humanity,
I am not fickle or consumed by worthless greed,
It entices us laughing sweetly in the night,
It chases us through the stars crying when we bleed,
Come and play with me it calls,
It runs on ahead playing a hungry little game,
It giggles in ecstasy as children run to it,
It wraps its arms around them staking its claim,
You are mine now, it tells the children,
You are my own flesh and blood,
Spread my message to the others of your kind,
Tell them it’s a reward for being good,
It claws at our skin, ripping away our flesh,
I like to play this game it laughs gaily,
I have new victims every night,
I birth new children daily,
It spreads its black wings towards the midnight sky,
It causes every murder while its eyes glint like a dying fire spark,
Go my children tell them to run,
Tell them to come and play in the dark…
