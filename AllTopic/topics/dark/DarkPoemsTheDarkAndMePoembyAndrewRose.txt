Im lost in my own dark little world,
it has four walls,
a window,
& a door,
Its forever 3am and sleep escapes me once more,
Im doomed to lie here,
with only my conscious as comfort,
& the dark as my friend,
Only i know whats said in the dark,
whats done in the dark,
Im left to myself in the dark,
The sandman,
he is no saviour,
for he has not come tonight,
now i must seek the safety of day,
of light,
Only hell is alike,
with purgatory for dessert,
I can only hope,
for sweet somnium,
Tonight...
