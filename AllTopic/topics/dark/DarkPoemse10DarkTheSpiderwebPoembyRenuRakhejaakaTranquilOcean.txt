As his mind weaves
A spiderweb on the wall
Of his heart
I silently watch
Bemused
Admiring the intricate web
So light
Beguiling in its softness
And watch the hovering bees
Slowly becoming a prisoner
Caught in its beauty
And
The spider mind
Already moved
To a new wall
To make
Its next masterpiece
