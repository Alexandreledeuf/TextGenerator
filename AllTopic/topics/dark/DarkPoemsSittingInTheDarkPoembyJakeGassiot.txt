I am sitting here in the dark
I am thinking of all the pain
Forgetting all the happiness
I keep thinking that if I do it
Then I wont have to worry anymore
But then I think of why I haven’t done it
My mind searching for the answer
I find it
I haven’t done it because of people
I want to do it because of them
But they are what is keeping me alive
I feel it eating away more and more
Every time I sit here
I feel as if I can’t get out
Of this black hole of pain
I feel the cuts getting deeper
I am sitting here in the dark
Should I pull the trigger
