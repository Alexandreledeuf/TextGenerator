Dark girl so filled with strife
Dark Dark girl she'll take your life
Dark girl stay for a while
Dark Dark girl she makes me smile
Dark girl she shows no fear
Dark Dark girl is always near
Dark girl wont see her cry
Dark Dark girl just wants to die
But Dark girl lives in the dark
so you dont see her painfull mark
Dark Dark girl may never know
just how much the light can show
