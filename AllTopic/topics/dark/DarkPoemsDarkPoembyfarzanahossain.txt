Dark is a shade of my heart.
When I close my eyes I see a ray of light in dark.
It gives me pleasure of finding you in dark.
It gives me life of your existence.
It gives me passion of your adorable touches.
I always want to close my eyes to see u in dark.
This is the way I want you.
When I open my eyes you are not in my mind.
It gives me sorrow of losing you in dark.
It gives me confusion of your existence.
It gives me loneliness when I am surrounding with people.
I never wanted to open my eyes cause I love you.
This is the way I love you.
