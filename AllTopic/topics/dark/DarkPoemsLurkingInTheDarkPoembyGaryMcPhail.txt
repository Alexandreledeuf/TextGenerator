From the shadows his hand took a hold of my wrist,
I panicked and struggled to escape his tight grip,
I heard his footsteps creep behind mine
the sweat dripped and tears filled my eyes,
I ran
until reaching an empty road dead as the night,
It scared me the most.
I didn't look behind
he may be ready to attack at any time,
I regained my courage and turned to see if he would show,
His where abouts I did not know,
There I was
Standing alone,
Surrounded by mist and the trees that spoke,
The sun started to fall
my heart beat began to rise,
As once again
I felt his hand touch mine.
