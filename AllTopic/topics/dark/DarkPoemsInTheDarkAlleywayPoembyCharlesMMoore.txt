I felt her smile like the rays of the sun
approaching me I almost felt she would run
calling my name with a pleasuring glee
excitingly glorious she came to me
We talked and we laughed holding hands in the park
a crisp winters morning we felt the ice crack
old friends and old lovers like we just met
remembering times we could never forget
Back in our teens we ran wild through the streets
with friends in a gang and the world at our feet
mischief and trouble were things we knew well
trust was a byword for love that we felt
We became closer and needed more time
exploring emotions we just had to find
that first teenage kiss in the dark alleyway
still with us eternal remembered today
The broken Coke sign flickering in the cafe
we nervously laughed as it flashed Cok each day
all through the winter we huddled and talked
encouraging moments that we couldn't stop
Our friends drifted off somewhere in the unknown
as we bonded closer in love on our own
enjoying the pleasures of body and mind
as teenagers do as they grow through that time
We tried to make plans for the future I guess
but we were just amateurs out of our depth
as the spring came it melted the snow and our dreams
and we stretched our wings seeking different things
Forty years on at the roadside cafe
the Coke sign still flickers as we nervously
smile at each other and remember the day
of that first teenage kiss in the dark alleyway.
