Driving on the nights highway
Deep into the dark night that swells
Scorched by the moonlight gone astray
The wind laments, the devils dwell
The dark blanket of the night enshrouds
A sudden chill, a gust of fog envelops
Sensing a bad omen, together we all crowd
The car sputters, the engine goes bust
The spirits rise from the ashes
Chanting ha ho, ha ho
A searing bolt of lightning lashes
Will there be no dawn tomorrow
The wolves huddle, stalking around our door
We could hear the beats of our heart
Whimpering with fear, crouching on the floor
As they lunge....I wake up with a start.
