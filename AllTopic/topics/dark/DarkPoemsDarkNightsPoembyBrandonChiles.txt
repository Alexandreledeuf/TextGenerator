Dying Romantic says:
I walk these streets all alone,
the sound of your voice still ringing on my phone.
You just couldn't leave our past behind,
why must I be the one that's always kind?
Your face haunts my nightmares,
and you always leave me something on the stairs.
I burn it with glee,
and yet you send more to pester me.
This heart can't take any more abuse,
so let me cut you loose.
This is goodbye...
