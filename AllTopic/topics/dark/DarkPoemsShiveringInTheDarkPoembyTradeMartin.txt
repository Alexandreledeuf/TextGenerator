The lights are silenced....,
The shades are drawn...,
While waiting impatiently....,
For the dawn....,
I'm Shivering In The Dark...,
Lonely and scared....,
Shivering In The Dark...,
In the far distance...,
I hear a faint siren....,
Unlike the siren in my heart...,
Calling for you....,
While I'm shivering....,
Shivering In The Dark...,
Waiting, wondering, quivering...,
And Shivering In The Dark.
