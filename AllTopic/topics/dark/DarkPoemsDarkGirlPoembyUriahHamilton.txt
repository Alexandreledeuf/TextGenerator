One day,
Dogs will laugh
In the streets,
And we’ll kiss wildly
Like lunatics
Escaping the asylum.
You’re a dark girl
So I’m painting
My roses black,
And I’ll murder the sun
If he ever turns his back.
I would rather
Enter the palace of your pain
Than continue to exist
In the prison cell of my loneliness.
