night is a un explained song,
when my dreams let me
venture out and cross
the darkened borders.
at night it came,
darkness in the river,
in the jungle,
in the sky
inside my body,
opening the window
of fog,
i looked at him,
who held me in my dreams.
night passed in a trance
as i opened my eyes
to see the early morning  sunrise,
saying adieu,
to the vanishing moon.!
