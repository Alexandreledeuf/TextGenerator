Here in my bedroom deprived of all light
My senses reach out to the blackness of night
How heightened they are… no need to see
The sounds of our home give comfort to me
My wife lies beside me… I Love her so much
My mind reels with passion at the thought of her touch….
She is so angelic in the embrace of her sleep
Her spirit exploring other worlds strange and deep…
The smell of perfume like flowers of spring
Fills me with warmth and contentment within
The sound of her breathing… steady and slow
She feels safe and cosy I’m happy to know..
The taste of her lips still fresh in my mind
The touch of her skin as it pressed against mine….
As she gently drew me…. my passions alight
Into her warm body where our spirits unite
Oh! What a dream has this reality become..
Living and loving.. a couple as one…
The reason I came here to this mortal life..
Is now so apparent
To experience my wife
