Suspended by his wrath
A mind that is fraught
With delusions about his genius
And a sea of dissatisfaction
Yearning to reach a bliss
Hanging by his dark desires
Burning in his blazing fire
The Vampire lurks.....
Led by a belief
That he will get his release
Riding on her dreams
As he spots her, his inner eye gleams
He gets a whiff of the expanded soul
And he wants ALL of it to make him whole
The light that will glorify him
The Vampire strikes.....
