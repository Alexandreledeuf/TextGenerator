Welcome to my haunted house
Dare to see the dark in me
Suits of armor wait to joust
Eyes in portraits move to see
Stroke my ego, don't be shy
Give my id his equal pay
Watch the serpent slither by
My alter ego's chance to play
In the dungeon sleeps the creature
Securely cuffed in mounted chains
Disregard his ragged features
Please excuse the carpet stains
Behind the bookcase hides my secrets
Discretion swept up under rugs
The dark in me you haven't met
Struggles loose in warring tugs
Tempting me in carnal pleasure
Rewarding me if I dare
Accolades in grand measure
Disposing me in deep despair
