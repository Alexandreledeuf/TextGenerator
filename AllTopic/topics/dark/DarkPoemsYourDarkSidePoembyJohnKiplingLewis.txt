solitude stands in the bar door
the place i go to find her
her lips like wine
why don't i love you more?
i could answer you call everyday
but i fear you
your dark side
the last few trists have been wonderful
your dark side
but we've never talked this much before
perhaps i only had to strike up the conversation
or listen to your thoughts
your dark side
