The abyss yawns and beckons....
Its so easy to dropp in
To just give up the resistance
And get drawn
by the magnetic force within....
Feel the joy of the sheer slide
as you go deep down
Did you indulge in all sins?
Did you revere the demons?
Just close your eyes
and enjoy the slide
Listen to the sound
of your soul's laughter
mocking you.....
Make the soul flee
from your body
Revel in it
Dwell in it
Celebrate your freedom
Now no need to abstain from
any form of sin
Let the journey begin....
