Uneasy darkness envelopes me.
Blinding moments
of mood disorient
this creature of melancholy.
A great saddness
my constant
companion.
My family is
moving away.
They haven't  left yet,
but oh they are going...
yes, they are going,
far away,
far away.
An uneasy foreboding
catches me unawares,
a premonition of tenebrous days ahead...
Questions thrown
to the ether...
Will I see you again?
Will fate take me away
before we can reunite?
A great saddess yes indeed,
yes indeed...
Dark, dark, dark...
