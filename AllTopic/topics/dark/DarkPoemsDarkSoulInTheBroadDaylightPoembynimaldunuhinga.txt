A poor chap is digging trenches
in the frontier beneath the Sungod.
He is not in regular army
who enrol voluntarily.
Like an arrow he has fallen to the earth
who cannot read and write.
For the daily wage he press his thumb mark
on the matt finished wages sheet
but his cataract blurred the notes.
He scorch like charcoal
and he sweats like an ocean.
During the short interval he take a catnap
and he dreams who became the Major General.
He is bit unhappy when he come to the reality
But this brave soul's smile covers all  his mentality.
