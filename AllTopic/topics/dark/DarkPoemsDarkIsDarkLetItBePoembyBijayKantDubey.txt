Dark is dark, let it be,
Dark is dark, let it be,
What it was dark, is still now and will
Continue to be so in future,
Dark is dark, let it be,
What it was, what it is,
Dark is dark,
Dark the myths of life,
Dark the tales of the Creation,
Darker the ways of the world
Taking to which man comes here,
Taking to that man goes out.
