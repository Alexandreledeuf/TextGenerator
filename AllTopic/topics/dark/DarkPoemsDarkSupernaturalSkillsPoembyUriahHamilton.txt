Urgency of frantic desire
Requires witchcraft
Or that I become
A mystical gypsy
Reading fortunes and the future
By tea leaves or the alignment of the stars
In the cryptic and magical sky.
I have already read my misfortune in your eyes,
And that my every fragile hope to be with you
Flees like a frightened child,
That the path is mapped
For me to become a man of your distant past,
Driven further and further
From your memories.
If I could only learn
Dark supernatural skills
That could transform fate
Into ardent dreams,
Then you would linger here
In a blissful embrace.
