A deep dark night
Clutching like a parasite
Strange dark woods
Throwing its hoods
Refusing to let go
Howling winds blow
Threatening whirlpools
Demons rule
Tentacles and vines
circle and entwine
your dark mind
Raging tempest
Anguished quest
Died a thousand deaths
Trying to set love on the breath
Deep cloud cover
O seething lover
Dont burn so bright
In your own light
Slide out from the side
Do it now
Before you die
Run, escape
Before you get raped
By your own mind
Thats made you blind
With its simmering steam
can hear your soul scream
Soar up to the sky
Along the length of my thigh
Wings of your fancy and fly
Up, up, high, high
Join me inside
Inside my love, Die.....
