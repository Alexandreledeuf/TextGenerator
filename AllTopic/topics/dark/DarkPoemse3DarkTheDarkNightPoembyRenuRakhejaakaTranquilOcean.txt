Why is tonight such a dark night
What is it trying to hide?
Sweeping a dark velvet shroud shutting all light
Invoking the restful spirits to rise
Rise, rise, slowly they rise
Mortals like us standing in a hush
The shaman suddenly lets out a cry
His chants gone awry in a sudden rush
They swoop, they circle, they speak without words
A sudden breeze blows, an icy shudder flows
The owl lets out a shriek, so do other birds
The demons in the mortals sneak out in rows
The wolves come out from the men
To join the dance of its hosts
Circling over the body of the shaman
Being feasted by the ghosts
The men stand rooted in a respectful trance
The moon slides in to watch casting its silvery light
To see this orgy of the dark, to see them all dance
As the fog creeps in and then out, they have floated out of sight
