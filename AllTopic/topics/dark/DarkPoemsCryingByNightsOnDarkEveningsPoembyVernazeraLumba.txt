As far as I remembered,
We were friends since forever,
Each other we never hated
Because we controlled our temper
But slowly we separated
And our laughter slowly faded
Our communication failed to start
Birthday cards became belated
And although we are apart
You are still in my heart
But for our friendship I hold fear
It’s going down hill in a wheeled cart
I hope someday you will reappear
And someday that you’ll be near
For every night I cry tears
For every night I cry tears
