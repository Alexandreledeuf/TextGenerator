As the girdle of time
digs sharply into my flesh
As the black veil of my existence
hides the impermeable Truth
As the flame of my thoughts move in
rapid circles and become a mere line
As the vulture of pervading questions
devour my almost dead body
As the furnace of my yearning
bakes it into a solemn comprehension
That this is the Enddddddddddd.
