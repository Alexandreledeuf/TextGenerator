The poppies bow in honour of the fallen,
Swaying in the breeze, in fear of time,
Red gaping wounds upon the planets corpse,
Each scarlet petal a tear shed for our crimes,
Worn in remembrance of our shame…
Storm clouds gather, predicting repetition,
The starless grey sky prepares to weep
It’s bitter flood upon the sighing earth,
The murky light its secret tries to keep,
Believing its disgrace can be disguised…
A waning line of light takes one last breath,
Choking on blood the lonely flowers shed,
Heaven laments the passing of their bloom,
Angels and artists cry requiem for the dead,
Silence descends upon a once bright evening…
