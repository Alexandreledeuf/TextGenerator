Wings of dark evenly spread,
Flatter slowly around my head.
Everything is deepening gloom
A Foreboding of my very doom.
Falling deeper every day,
Unable to see my weary way.
Sinking slowly into the mires,
No warmth from earthly fires.
No hope as darkness takes it hold,
Squeezed into this my depressive mould.
I see no light in this perpetual dark,
Utter sadness has cancelled my human spark.
Please put an end to this bitter struggle,
I can no longer with life's hopes juggle,
Leave me to my self-pity and despair.
A ghost of myself I am no longer there.
