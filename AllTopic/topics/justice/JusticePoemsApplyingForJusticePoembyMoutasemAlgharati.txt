This has something to do with whom it may concern
Dear all I know, ordinary and close, new or old
Because of you, is the answer of all what happen?
I am writing, in response of what inner voice told?
By knowing all, mind is shaped with unknown pieces of ice
As well as earth's, yet earth's has its own tourist guide
He, who shows directions, guides skiing after sunrise
For mine, default memory abroad navigates with a boat guy
Remember? The first sight lesson you taught me to judge!
Even unjust court listens to convicts, who grabbed living right
Jealous friends you were! Inspiring with fibs, but those large!
Though you are many, only very few fed my life with light
I am looking forward to hearing a persuasive reply soon
Yours sincerely, CC; My cynosure and loyal friend: moon
