Forget Not Divine Justice!
What discrepancies
Be corrected by what measures
We don't know,
But divine justice sure will
Do rectify them one day or other!
Man made justice
May be duped by loop holes of law,
But divine justice
Will surely take revenge
To bring order to world one day!
Till then the boat
Will only go with the stream current
And who can render
Justice to all the crimes
That are piling up on?
We can only
Just wait and watch ever
What's going on
Before our own eyes here to
learn lessons from experience!
