What is justice?
This unapparent fairness
Supposed to combine rather than divide
Just a word that likes to hide
This unapparent fairness
What is justice?
Justice, is between you and if you are righteous
And you might just be righteous,
But you don’t have the intelligence of the truths of real justice.
Justice, is merely impossible because we have created injustice.
And just this.
It may be a tongue twister to read
But justice is a twist of the tongue indeed
A twist of the lung, you can’t breathe
A twist of the fun, full of hypocrisy and greed
A fake term misused, abused of its creed
Our mouths say justice, but injustice is what we really speak
And just this.
What is justice?
This unapparent fairness
Supposed to combine rather than divide
Just a word that likes to hide
This unapparent fairness
What is justice?
Just a word, and just this.
