In a lightly morn
A person was born
After lots of stories and the morbid things,
He decided to sing,
To sing a song of a dirty world,
A world full of lies and fake words
A world of lust and stupid joys
A world that consist of different girls and boys
A world of nags and nasty actions to some of us
A world that nothing inside it is true bust loss
A world that we live in
A world that lives with no mean
A world for rich guys with their colorful cars
A world of giant wars
A world full of words, full of verses, full of hope
Where young saint children have no hope
There is no world for those children that I saw
I hate those fake words and speeches about the laws
Look around please. Think a little. What do we miss? !
For sure lots of things. And one of them is justice!
Justice of those old times I think you know,
Justice that a man done, and what about now?
How can all the cruelties happen in a world?
How a human can breaks the rules in a world?
How can we make the wrong decisions about our dears in a world?
How can we forget the justice, how do we forget the justice in a world?
How you and I claims about the rights of people in a world?
A world that goes well. A world that will handle by some powerful human's words.
