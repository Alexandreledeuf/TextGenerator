She is passionate about
fairness and equality.
Justice is not just a store,
but rather a progressive and important social concept.
Rosa Parks and Mother Teresa
are role models who inspire her.
She likes how February is
Black History month
and March is
Women's History month,
but yet she still ponders
how women have only had
the right to vote
since 1920 in America.
Not even 100 years
have passed
and there has never been
a woman President.
She doubts some men
would ever vote
for a woman President
and that makes her sad.
She likes when women
do not hit the glass ceiling
and instead rise
to positions of leadership.
She thinks pay inequality
based on gender
is grossly unfair.
She ponders how can men still be
paid vastly more
for the exact same job as a woman
in a progressive society?
She is a social justice girl.
