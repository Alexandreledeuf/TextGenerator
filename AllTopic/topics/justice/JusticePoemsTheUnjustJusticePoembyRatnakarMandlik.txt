For years together there were no rains
We adulated you, my God, impatiently then.
Requesting you to allow rains to rain,
for diminishing your subjects inner pain.
Hungry we were and in search of bread,
In search of water, tears we had to shed.
Nothing we could do other than devotion,
Expiating always for all the committed sins.
No one could stop the harsh man slaughter
No one could bring on dry lips a laughter.
Then came a day, the day of your glory,
Every side fainted with cats and dogs raining.
What is this unjust justice, I could'nt guess,
Oh God, do you want us only difficulties to face.
