when justice fails because the constable has blundered
do not be surprised, do not even be discouraged,
proceed in procurring justice still with the way how you are trained
to do so,
get the fingerprints of your thoughts and present the same
to those who doubt and wavered, show them the intricate lines
of your own determinations
this is how it must be done
there is still a map of this destination,
when justice fails because the judge and justices have also lost
their sense
what justice is and how it should be dispensed like a blindfolded lady
that you misunderstand with her scales on one hand and a sword
on the other,
do not be shaken, do not lose hope, heave a sigh and breathe
the remaining clean air,
there are still those who in silence still remain steadfast
holding on to truth
and keeping their hands clean and hearts pure and minds active
to the pursuit of this eternal approximation
of fairness
there are still those whose eyes still daze to the glitters not of gold
but of truth, beauty, and goodness,
i will count you in
please count me in too
and how about you?
i ask, please be counted
we shall stand on the good side of things
we shall look for the brightest star
the ideal from among the blunders in the darkness of our nights
let the hammer fall and let it fall everyday
let those in the dark side have their houses full
