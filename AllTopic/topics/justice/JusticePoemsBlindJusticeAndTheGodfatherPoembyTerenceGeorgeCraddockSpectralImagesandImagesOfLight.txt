The United States
Supreme Court
lacks creditable
determinable
unity of purpose.
Guantanamo Bay
is a geographical
miscarriage of justice.
Guantanamo Bay
sanctioned sanitized
political spin styled military;
‘is a detainment facility
of the United States
located in (Castro)   Cuba.’
The Boy Scouts
honour badges
ran summer camps
detainment areas
three Gitmo resorts
Camp Delta/ Echo
Camp Iguana but
Camp X-Ray was;
closed due to naughty
torture techniques
that’s human rights
violations
ok boys and girls?
The Justice Department?
Said its ok because
Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp
is our sneaky hidy-hole
outside U.S. legal jurisdiction!
Fuhrer Reich
Chancellor Bush
declared detainees;
were not allowed
not allowed
any protections
under humane
Geneva Conventions!
January 11,2002
the first twenty
prisoners arrived
ghost prisoners
held in hall of shame.
June 29,2006
the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld;
prisoners are entitled
to minimal protections
listed under
Common Article 3
Geneva Conventions.
July 7,2006
Department of Defense
internal memo prisoners
in the future;
are entitled to protection
under Common Article 3.
June,2008
detainees held
are classified
enemy combatants
by the United States!
January 22,2009
President Barack Obama
suspends proceedings of
Guantanamo
military commission
for 120 days
detention facility
to be shut down
within the year.
But oh dear
to date
its still there!
May 20,2009
United States Senate
block funds;
needed to transfer
release prisoners
held at
Guantanamo Bay
detention camp.
November,2009
215 prisoners
remained
at Guantanamo Bay
detention camp.
December 15,2009
President Barack Obama
Presidential Memorandum;
orders preparation of
Thomson Correctional Center
in Thomson Illinois
to prepare for transferred
Guantanamo prisoners.
The first ammendment
protects the rights
of citizens individuals;
but not at the expense
of national security.
There is no greater
singular unity
of purpose;
than protecting
homeland security.
Three gangsters
international bully boys
Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld;
create an illegal US prison
unique overwhelming
in untried innocence.
The Definitive List
The Guantánamo Files
history has proven to date;
‘at least 93 percent
of the 779 men and boys
imprisoned in total’
were completely
innocent people!
Or Taliban foot soldiers
fighting an internal
inter-Muslim civil war;
with no connection to
Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda
or international terrorism!
A war that started long
before the terrorist attacks
of September 11,2001.
Prisoners seized
as a result of
dubious intelligence;
or sold for
bounty payments!
The Motown
Supremes
sang with
greater integrity
unity of purpose.
January,2010
198 Guantanamo Bay
prisoners remained?
What future for the untried?
January 25,2010
Guantanamo Detainee
Review Task Force
is recommending...
nearly 50 detainees
be held indefinitely
without charge!
Washington Post claims
task force determined
Gitmo prisoners;
facing indefinite detention
are too dangerous
catch twenty-two
too dangerous
to be released;
not enough evidence
for a criminal trial.
Wow nine years on
the panel recommends
35 prisoners be brought;
to the U.S. to face military
or civilian fair trials!
Attorney General Eric Holder
‘decided five will be tried in
New York federal court;
for their alleged roles in
the 2001 terror attacks’!
Six to be tried by military commissions
Thomson Correctional Center
will likely house terrorism-era detainees!
Their crimes?
Allegedly spent time
at al Qaeda training;
camps in Afghanistan
prior to the 9/11 attacks!
Luckily being a marine
or a navy seal is not a crime
but linked to Taliban is!
Held without due process is legal?
In the Land of the Free
where imprisonment is double;
the next country at number two.
America has gotta be number one!
And our winners in our
State Lottery are Task Force (zap zap)
divided into three groups
‘35 who should be prosecuted  (fair trial?)
in federal or military courts’ (yea 9 years ago)
‘110 who can be released, (pardon the yawn)
either immediately or eventually’ (no hurry)
‘50 who must be detained without trial’
Apparently Gitmo detainees
‘perhaps others suspected
terrorists and war fighters
taken into U.S. custody
will now have a difficult
time challenging
their detention.’
No shit! Really?
‘Guantanamo Bay detainees
officially have limited rights in court
and presidential war powers to detain;
suspected terrorists trump the
international law of war.’
‘Officials said the detainees
cleared for release
will be repatriated or transferred to;
other countries for
possible release? ’
Is this the way we fight the war,
fight the war fight the war,
fight the war, on terrorism?
When you declare war
on words apparently it is
however it is not the way;
to win hearts and minds
to a just honourable cause!
Could it be said
the world’s policeman
has over stepped;
the boundary
of his jurisdiction?
That a few statutes
of liberty
have been transgressed?
Empire America
no longer fears
divine retribution;
God was outlawed
in public places!
Oh modern Babaylon
the Great, once so admired,
the eagle is falling;
the writing is on the wall
or on Wall Street?
Repent of your Hubris Oh America
‘M’ne! M’ne! T’kel ufarsin P’res’
‘ME’NE, ME’NE, TE’KEL, PAR’SIN’
This writing is not yet written on your wall!
