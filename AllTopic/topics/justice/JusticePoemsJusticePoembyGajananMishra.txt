come and see where it is
you find dancing the sea.
Never find the sky loughing
somewhere in the city.
you find me without
size and shape
the rough road ahead.
come and see
I am missing
in the gitamandir.
And i am somewhere
on the bank of the ganga
where judge is there
to pass order
after the game over.
