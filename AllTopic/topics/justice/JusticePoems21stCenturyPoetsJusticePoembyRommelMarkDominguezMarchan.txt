To all poets

trying hard

we are like pets
with extrasensory flesh
sucking artificial earth's face
mask of mystery
ordinary folks
fail to see
we are pets
we have high sense
of smell
taste
sensitive furs
we can howl
scream
bellowing for serious attention
respect
understanding, love
for being an
extra ordinary human creatures
neglected by time
counter interest of
modern  era
the economic sabotage
the modern tech enthusiasm
yes we are pets
feeding foods to nourish
