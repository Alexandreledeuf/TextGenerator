Slaves to the powers
of the external mind
If your innocent or guilty
they do not mind
Watching and waiting
to make their strike
They'll take you down
and watch you drown
As long as they get somebody
to make themselves proud
They won't care
that your mind is not all there
All over the world
The powers of the external mind
is watching you
