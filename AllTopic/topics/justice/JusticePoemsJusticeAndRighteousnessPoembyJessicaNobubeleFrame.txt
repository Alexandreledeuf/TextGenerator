How can we speak of justice?
Mercy
Righteousness
How do we proclaim it aloud?
Speak up against the cruelty?
Lord can we cry out for mercy?
For those that die daily,
For the helpless children
Those sold into slavery
For abuse and violence
Mercy
Mercy
Mercy
What we need is your mercy
Justice
Fair treatment
Human dignity restored
Yes, thatâ€™s what they need
Lord forgive us for our cruelty towards our brothers and sisters
Towards our fellow human beings
Forgive us for we are a corrupt city
An unjust society
A flawed nation
Forgive us when we mistreat the innocent
Mock the hungry and the destitute
And when we disregard the plight of the poor
And return home to our feasts and our comfy furniture
Show us how to walk in your light
How to live right,
Loving justice and mercy
And walking in humility everyday
Jesus we need your mercy
And if no one else will say this,
Then I will:
We need your cross and your salvation
