Laws are after all laws
With lot many lacuna and flaws
As counter system works
It is battle with clever words
“We, in the name of lord” lawyers argue
The accused stand silently in queue
The battle is fought without army
The client is in hurry and unhappy
No poor can afford such battle
He has no guts to carry on struggle
So they avoid such wrangle
It is as good as adding to more troubles
We hear conflicting reports in public
“The justice is sold” says alcoholic
No one believes his words
We have to wait only and look forwards
The cases are dragged on for years
This creates lots of agony and fear
Whole is life is spent in waiting
You get extension with more dating
Drug carriers and mafias invite
Most of the time to fight
Politicians carry importance
Their cases are heard at once
“Justice delayed is justice denied”
The sentence is alright but hopes are bellied
Justice if for rich and for those who can afford
You just take oath to speak right word
