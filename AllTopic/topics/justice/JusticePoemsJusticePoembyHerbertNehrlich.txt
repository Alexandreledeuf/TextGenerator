An eighteen-legged female spider
had fallen in a vat of cider.
She struggled with her puny legs
and lost, due to the fear, her eggs.
The spiderwife began to panic
and feared she would, like the Titanic,
end at the bottom, thus deep down,
(non-swimming spiders often drown) .
She pledged to be a brave example,
to struggle while she still had ample
tenacity and strong reserves.
She would ignore her fraying nerves.
The spider's movements now were slowing
as all her glycogen was going.
But, just before the final minute
she yelled: 'The cider, aren't I in it? '
And, within seconds she had found
that she now stood on solid ground.
That moment, when the farmer's mother
checked on the cider and said  'BROTHER! '
It had become a solid mess,
the why was anybody's guess.
The eggs had dropped into the cider,
been agitated by the spider,
eventually it had become
eggnog without a hint of rum.
Relieved, the spiderwoman rested
outside the vat, when (hairy-chested) ,
a frog hopped over, just to see.
He asked 'To Be Or Not To Be? '
Of course he ate the little spider,
then stuck his tongue into the cider
and drank through lingual osmosis.
He died of terminal cirrhosis.
