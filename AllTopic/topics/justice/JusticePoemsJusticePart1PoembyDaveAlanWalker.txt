It was
Just another day
Or so I thought
But madness
Had got me
I didn't even know
I was walking
Through the city
Minding my own
When I saw a man
Hurt someone
I should have known
I should have turned away
I should have gone another way
But my mind
Wouldn't let me
It was too far away
I'm chasing
I'm chasing
I'm gaining
But I'm losing
I'm fighting
But I'm not moving
I'm chasing
My dreams away
I catch him
I beat him
I take the blame for him
Then I pay
For what he done
Twenty years of pain
Justice never done
