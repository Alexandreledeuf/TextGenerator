Prison
Dark room
No light
Human life breathes
Murder charge
Old age
Innocent soul
Suffers justice call
Hard labor
To work as stone cutter
Bones crack after days work
Real pain and eyes spark
Is this the life to suffer?
Is this the punishment to offer?
Prison sentence before trial
Human abuse with justice denial
