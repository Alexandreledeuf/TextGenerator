A nation raped…
Mute, stunned, indignant
World watched, ashamed…
Cruelty, hate, evil
(Put to shame, even devil)
Drives the mentally ill…
Justice delayed
While we, a messiah await
Or resigned to fate…
Does God Wait
For good sense to prevail…
And love conquers hate…
Justice denied
Shocked, aggrieved wail…
While accused hide…
Who does one blame?
Deeply reflect,
And introspect….
