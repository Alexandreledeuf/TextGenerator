`
Provide us just scales
with which to measure
determine the truth
provide no displeasure
be objective and distant
make sure you're blindfolded
mete out the verdict
swift and without fail.
But for the value of life
remember your own
Each breath you take
opportunities blown
Justice is never served
for the dead remain dead
their chances forfeited
memories defaulted
punitive arrangements
may placate the bereaved
but the dead remain deceased.
