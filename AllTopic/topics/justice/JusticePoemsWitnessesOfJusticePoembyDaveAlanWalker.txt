They say they saw
Then they go and lie
Put people in prison
for a crime
Why would they lie
Is it in their mind
How can they live
knowing this
Has their soul
got a conscience
Will it eat them away
until one day they will have to say
what they saw that day
Maybe they are traumatized
by dismay
But it doesn't mean
they have to put innocent people away
The lies must stop
Why should the guilty get away
While innocent people
rot away
