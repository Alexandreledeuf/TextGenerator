I'm walking
I'm walking
I can hear
The hospital talking
Doctor death
Wants to get
In my head
Laid me on the bed
Put electrodes
To my head
Blasted me
Till I'm nearly dead
They knew I'd confessed
With voices
In my head
Now they was
Trying to make
Me dead
Did they think
I wouldn't survive
Did they think
I'd go and hide
As the years
Rolled by
My demons
Said goodbye
Now it's time
To have justice
On my side
Doctor death
You can't hide
It's justice time
