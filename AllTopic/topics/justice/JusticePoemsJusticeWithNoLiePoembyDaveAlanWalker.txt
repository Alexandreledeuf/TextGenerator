An innocent man
lies his head down to rest
not wanting to wake
to the morning sun
Instead wanting to wake
in a parallel universe
where truth and justice
is number one
In the real world
his days seem like years
they eat away at his
mind body and soul
If a witness would lie
he knows he might die
before truth and justice
Would see the light
but he's got to keep up the fight
All he wants
is justice with no lie
so come forward
and let truth and justice
shine it's light
