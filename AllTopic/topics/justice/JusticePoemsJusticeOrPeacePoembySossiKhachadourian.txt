How can be  a difference between peace and justice
I never knew there could be a difference
Among these  two essential points for survival our world's
I always thought they complete each other
Humanity's world has got destroyed
How can the world bear all these woes
But if ill be asked to choose among those
Justice or the peace
I would choose the peace
Because without peace lives stop surviving
As well as the world
But what's the meaning of justice
It's the difference among our thoughts
Thoughts if neglected lives will be survived
But when the peace deserts our lives
No one will stay alive
So for what is your justice when it will take lives
