A jury sat around a tree
to judge a man for treason.
The foreman said 'how can it be
this fellow had no reason.
A patriot who, for his land
stood deep in Flanders' trenches,
today is forced to take a stand
and face Justitia's benches.
Then tea was served and little snacks,
one of the jurors fainted,
she found it hard to just relax
when evidence was tainted.
They shot the fellow near the tree,
'twas sanctioned by the nation.
They had no proof that one could see,
did no investigation.
It often happens in this world
where imbeciles now rule,
and when their ugly lies are hurled
it's  you who   plays the fool.
They put you down, just like a dog
and laugh when you expire.
Then toast each other with their grog,
it's  JUSTICE  they admire.
The little word  INTEGRITY
has fallen out of favour.
The tea served underneath the tree
does have a modern flavour.
