I am Trayvon Martin
Yo soy Trayvon Martin
Je suis Trayvon Martin
Mwen se Trauvon Martin
For a long time and even now,
Justice
Is never irrelevant to us.
Very often, we wonder how
Come we are always
The victims, the culprits,
The ones who get dumped in the pits
In the shallow graves.
We get killed by being in the wrong place
At the wrong time.
We get mace on our face
For no reasons.
A horrendous crime
Is being perpetrated this season
By the namby pamby warden,
Who should be in jail, in prison.
This is high treason
For not respecting valor,
Uniforms, candor
And peers.
No one cheers,
Once ignorance
And malfeasance
Show up at the door
Of the poor
Victims.
Everyone screams,
Because the injustice
Is blatantly obvious.
This is somewhat peculiar.
The skin color
Of the Scholar
Is the matter.
The brother and the sister
Finally got a job,
But when the stock broker
Can no longer rob
The poor clients;
The brother and the sister,
Who were last hired,
Are the first saints
To be fired.
Our offspring is profiled
From the crib;
Our progenitor is defiled
Anon, at the bottom of the crypt.
Justice
Is never irrelevant to us.
