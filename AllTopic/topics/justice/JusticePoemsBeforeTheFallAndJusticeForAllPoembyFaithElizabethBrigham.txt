they say pride comes
before the fall
who will be there for you
if there is anyone at all
surely things can not go on
as they have done all along
where tyrants reign and
justice is merely feigned
don your armor and
prepare your swords
for the things i speak
are not merely words
i challenge you to fight the war
the dawn is coming and
soon you will see
your cruelty will no
longer be endured
