Justice is revenge for those who have suffered loses,
And for others itâ€™s a punishment
It involves the truth, not the lies
If you want Justice you must be able to stand up for the truth.
It is not just going to come and knock on your door
You must be able to listen to the truth
What is justice really?
Is it truth, or revenge?
What is truth?
What is revenge?
