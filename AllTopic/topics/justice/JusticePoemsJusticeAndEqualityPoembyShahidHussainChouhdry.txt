The right way to bestow, the glow way to Integrity,
If you wanna bloom, build a habit of Honesty,
Equality is the basic theme of Mankind,
Who is white who is black, it doesn't  Mind,
Justice! in each path of your Life,
It will transform your all acts Nice,
You not need to bow, don’t you Surrender,
Don’t be putative, Be the power of Thunder,
We the people of one God! Why there is difference!
Beat the Inequality, and place The Justice Preference!
Rich or Poor , Low or High, Don’t matter where You Are!
Will go the same grave same as martyred  Soldier after the War!
