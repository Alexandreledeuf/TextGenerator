The cold dark nights living out on the streets,
People walking past, not caring enough.
Those convicts whose lives that came on the fleets.
Whose lives were full of suffering were tough.
No one cares, no one helps, no one can see,
To live life being homeless is not swell,
Not a choice, as sometimes we need to flee,
From our present lives, not die in a well.
No food, no shelter, no blankets at night,
To try to find a way to stay alive,
And even sometimes get into a fight,
Some may suffer, but there are some who thrive.
We are normal people, but none can tell,
That we are human and all should be well.
