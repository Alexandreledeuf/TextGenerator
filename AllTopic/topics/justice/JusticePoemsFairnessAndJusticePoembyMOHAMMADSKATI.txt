Fairness and justice are                                              Just two nominal words on                                             Our earth because we completely                                       Lack them anytime and anywhere,                                      They are just two words in shape,                                    But we lack them totally in content,                                 They are like you dream to get them                                   When you need them in life, so we                                    Pay very high price when we lack them.
