There is a law which guarantees
that as you sow so shall you reap,
there’s no point in not guilty pleas.
The record keeper never sleeps.
That which you give you will receive.
The correct balance must be kept
just simple justice I believe.
You have no choice you must accept
The punishment that you deserve.
Forget the lies you have been taught
repenting misdeeds will not serve.
Your protestations count for nought.
The scales must balance exactly.
The  credit and the debit side,
no one is punished unjustly.
The law is equally applied.
There’s only you gives evidence
before a jury of your peers,
with wisdom and experience
to understand your hopes and fears
They will advise you that’s what they do.
About the things you need to learn
but the decisions left to you.
To choose to rest or quick return.
To start again with a clean sheet.
Another chance for you to earn
the merits needed to complete
the lessons which you need to learn.
Each life we live a step towards
a destination still unknown
Where we receive our just rewards
because we are at last full grown.
