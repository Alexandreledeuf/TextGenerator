We can never create a single life,
So we shouldn't have right to take it,
But what is going on all around a society,
Some psychotic man have been serial killer,
Some are killing people for so called revenge,
Some are killing as a victim of a situation,
Intentionally and unintentionally we are killing,
Now any one can say that for this we have laws,
But what is our law doing in the sake of justice?
Hanging a person, or electrocuting him on a chair,
In the name of painless death injecting poisons,
But are not these the way of killing a person?
Are not these the excuses to hide our failures?
This is us, Who give birth these sick murderers,
This is us, who let a man to be a killer,
Whatever that is, so called legal or illegal,
Are not these both killing processes sin?
Are not these bot about taking a life?
Can we say this justice a justice,
Which allows to take a life empowering a badge?
Think man...Humanity is crying in the door of justice...
