I assumed him wrong
He was not to be taken for real song
It was my greatest error
He was unlucky for ever
I had starved for him to be one
But he cared for nothing or none
He proved black sheep in real sense
It made me worrisome and tense
I was rushing in daytime
To see him anywhere anytime
I never bothered about hot sun
I was ready to go to any length or run
He has taken every inch of me
I have been made scapegoat to flee
With no place to go for safety
He has caused me lot of worries
I am no small chicken
I shall fight it out even
I know how to face each angle!
I can never be pushed to fail
I know I have been wronged
Yet it is fully managed
I shall survive and show
That life still can have easy water flow
He took me simply for sex object
Even though I knew it was tricky act
I had idea of withering storm
But let it go on reality term
I raise my head with honor
Even if he proved deserter
I want each woman folk to live with justice
So no one can break word or promise
