(This poem is dedicated to Hollister #22.)
Delayed justice is better than no justice.
The world will always be round.
Facts cannot be altered; prejudice
Is a major impediment to reach sound
Justice. Justice is all we want,
Fairness is what we fight for,
Justice is what we cry for,
Fairness is what we want.
All lives are special.
All God's children are beautiful.
All colors are essential,
To make the rainbow normal.
Justice, Justice is what we want,
Fairness is what we fight for.
Equality under the law is critical.
Equal shade can only make the rainbow
More beautiful and more impartial;
No justice will always be a Big No, No.
Justice is what we cry for,
Fairness is what we want.
The world will always be round.
Finally, we can hear the sound
Of the bells. Justice is around
The corner; she is upward bound.
Delayed justice is better than no justice.
