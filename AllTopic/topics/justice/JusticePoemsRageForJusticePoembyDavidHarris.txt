Sometimes we seethe with rage
over some heinous crime committed.
Our voices are raised with thousands of others
for justice to prevail, and then watch in disbelief
as a nominal sentence is incurred.
Although the courts think,
they decide the fate of the individual
it is inside the walls of prison
that really seals their fate.
Sex offenders and child abusers
are never welcome there.
The prisoners welter out
their own brand of punishment for them.
