A shot at romance
She was only ever ‘that girl’,
The one who always awoke instantly from the sound of:
An angry door slamming,
A single tear hitting the cold floor,
And a razor blade being dismantled from its safe covering.
But when she was with him-
With his arms of steal padlocked around her,
Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her,
Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep,
Their two fragmented hearts beating so close,
But they never got a chance to beat to
Beat as one.

It appears that this girl is in love, I think this is too wonderful for some With his arms of steal padlocked around her,
Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her,
Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep -, asked me to think of the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore - Rabindranath Tagore poetry that is a distant man to propose to a girl, but girl hiding in a Window closed behind, not the views of this man, but that men no longer appear in the girl's side, this girl very much miss the man, usually sitting on the window edge, once again look forward to the arrival of men on TV drama,
If this poem of the man who can no longer see the girl now, this girl will find themselves has been the biggest loss of life,
Poetry in my opinion this girl is not because of money and other external factors have my love, is one of the world heavy on sweet things to comfort the people of the beauty,
My irony in a story on some woman in this world willing to speak with the Devil would not treasure marriage,
Indeed, the true feelings and the feelings of real importance, as well as women and men through the feelings of the true, spiritual love combined are the foundation of the world,
Did not put the spirit of the people linked to the feelings of life linked to magma, such as water and fish together, this world is the terrible cold Forever hell

It seems that this girl rectifies above first love, my feel like this one paragraph of What a match With his arms of steal padlocked around her, Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her, Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep- - - - -, let me remember that poetry and song of Rabindranath Tagore's poetry and song- - Rabindranath Tagore is that the girl makes a proposal to one during the past a distance male person, this girl takes shelter from but behind the window being closing, reluctant idea this male person, That male person will have no the turn up time by this girl anymore but, this girl misses that male person very much, often sit by the window, be expecting that male person's once again arrival, Suppose male person in this poem will no longer appear by the girl, this girl maximal loss that can discover self having met with life, That I think that girl in this poetry and song is not love because of money and my other external factor comes into being, is beautiful conciliative heavy sweet in the world popular feeling object, My money and jewels which can not speak satirizing this some in the world women in being ready to follow a devil in a story gets married, Reliable, true affection and face to face true affection take seriously, the woman and the man pass real sentiments, the spirit feels attached to union each other and, basis being this world, People is not contacted together spirit affection magma is in life connection together, water and fish are in an image this world is forever chill terrifying hell together,

Evidently, this girl is occupying in the first love, I thought this section of too splendid With his arms of steal padlocked around her, Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her, Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep-, is called me to remember Tagore's poetry-Tagore's that poetry is a distant place man comes to a girl to propose, but this girl hides in is closing behind the window, is not willing to see this man, but that man has not appeared again in time this girl's side, this girl thinks of that man, sits frequently nearby the window, is anticipating that man's arrival once more, If in this poem's man does not appear again side the girl, this girl will discover that she has encountered the life biggest loss, I think in this poetry the girl is not because the money and my other external factors produce love, is in the world the serious happy comfort will of the people beautiful thing, I satirize in this world in a story some women to be willing the valuables and money marriage which will speak with the devil, Truly, the real sentiment and takes seriously the real sentiment, as well as the woman and the man through the real sentiment, the spirit loves one another the union, is this world foundation, The people have not contacted with in the together energetic sentiment the rock magma the life relates in together, looks like Shui Heyu in the same place, this world is forever the cold fearful hell,

看 样 子 ， 这 个 姑 娘 正 处 在 初 恋 中 ， 我 觉 得 这 一 段 太 精 彩 了 With his arms of steal padlocked around her,
Not even the sound of his heartbeat awoke her,
Instead it soothed and rocked her to sleep-， 叫 我 想 起 泰 戈 尔 的 诗 歌 -泰 戈 尔 的 那 诗 歌 是 一 个 远 方 的 男 子 来 向 一 姑 娘 求 婚 ， 但 这 姑 娘 躲 在 关 着 的 窗 子 后 面 ， 不 愿 意 见 这 男 子 ， 但 是 那 男 子 再 也 没 有 出 现 在 这 姑 娘 的 身 边 时 ， 这 姑 娘 非 常 想 念 那 男 子 ， 常 常 坐 在 窗 子 边 ， 期 待 着 那 男 子 的 再 次 到 来 ，
假 如 这 诗 中 的 男 子 再 也 不 出 现 在 姑 娘 身 边 ， 这 姑 娘 会 发 现 自 己 遭 到 了 人 生 的 最 大 的 损 失 ，
我 认 为 这 诗 歌 中 的 姑 娘 不 是 因 为 金 钱 和 我 其 它 外 在 因 素 产 生 的 爱 情 ， 是 世 界 上 沉 重 甜 蜜 的 安 慰 人 心 的 美 丽 事 物 ，
我 在 一 个 故 事 中 讽 刺 这 世 界 上 有 的 女 人 愿 意 跟 魔 鬼 的 不 会 说 话 的 财 宝 结 婚 ，
确 实 ， 真 实 的 感 情 和 对 真 实 的 感 情 重 视 ， 以 及 女 人 和 男 人 通 过 真 实 的 感 情 ， 精 神 相 恋 结 合 ， 是 这 个 世 界 的 基 础 ，
没 有 把 人 们 联 系 在 一 起 的 精 神 感 情 的 岩 浆 把 生 命 联 系 在 一 起 ， 像 水 和 鱼 在 一 起 ， 这 个 世 界 就 是 永 远 寒 冷 的 可 怕 地 狱 ，
