The memories embracing me, you see
as beautiful as they might be
they're tearing me apart
my already weak heart
This life is just a cruel game
this world, is a shame
conflicting stories, lovers torn apart
without the change of a new start
I was getting into the way of evil might
I lost everything that night
without your sudden appearance I'd have died
but your beautiful wings took me into the height
These arms around me with loving care
what else could I loose if we'd dare
beautifully entwining bodies, bare
anything I have, I want to share
Hot kisses on cold skin
let's commit the sweetest sin
feel the impact of loving
take away my grieving
Never thought it would find such an end
the one you called friend
to bring me death he was send
without you being there to defend
Now, with the time, all the centuries flowing
I still feel my longing for you growing
but will you now ever be knowing
that I'm waiting for you under the stars, the glowing
