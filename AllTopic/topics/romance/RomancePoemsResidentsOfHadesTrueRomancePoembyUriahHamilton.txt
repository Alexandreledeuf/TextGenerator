Beneath the pink horizon of dusk,
Parting words will be spoken
Over my shadowy grave;
Someone I used to love and trust
Will remember how she betrayed me
With a burning knife
Seared into my wounded heart,
And sheâ€™ll weep at the shattered remnants
Of my lonely poetry.
And if she enters the state
Of disintegration
Before my own oblivion overtakes me,
This will be her final victory
Until we inflame
All the residents of Hades.
