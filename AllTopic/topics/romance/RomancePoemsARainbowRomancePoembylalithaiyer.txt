Romance
to Bloom
let me wait
and watch out
When the Spring Rains;
it is
now in the sky
lustly curved
with stunning colours
just a minute
it whispers
a new tune of lies
and glues to heart
pining to see
the invisible sight
The embers
of Romance
lightens up
when the moist hearts
warmly rain
looks of Spring
full of perfumed wings
to suckle the nectar
to open up
the pot of potion
mesmerizing ocean
bodies vanish
leaving imprints
we see the lovers
kissing empty airs
seeing life images
like Rainbows
still printed
in transparent airs
