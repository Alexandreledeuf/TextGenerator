As we stood by the lake side
An expanse so wide
For us to see
Then you and me
Our reflection in autumn tones
Bemoans
Belies
The placid waters hidden lies
The first chill of an errant breeze
I looked to the side rather than say please
As the sculpted flakes saunter down
Rest arrogantly on the parting geese's crown
The lumbering crane takes to air I behold
Portend the pervasive cold
Easy an slow practiced rise
Should have been no surprise
There was the swoon the croon
The fetching of a moon
The freezing lake holds my feet
Gingerly tread the storm an sleet
I Shudder I fear.
How shall I steer
My innocence naught in natures way
Or to have you sway
The lake is empty, staid.
Like the uselessness of my golden braid
We stand mute frozen in time
Until the inevitable rhyme
Weather the icy romance
To waltz and dance
I and the lake submit to natures will
To seek in time the thaw the thrill
