This I know... I have one!
She is very special
I think she’s beautiful
And so very unusual...
She is intelligent,
also very sensual,
Both of which are to me
Relationship essentials
What most brought her to me
Was her sweet empathy
Which I appreciate
Most since I lost Peggy
She’s not a replacement,
I love her for her Self
She’s what it took to get
This widower off the shelf
She’s my loved Marina
from her head to her feet
And she has what it takes
To make my life complete
She’s lovely and I say
She’s my Russian Treasure
Gold has value, but my
Lady’s beyond measure
