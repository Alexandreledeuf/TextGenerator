So you want a piece of my
Rosy, cushy, juicy pie
I’m afraid, without romance on supply
This refined lady is not going to comply
Before into my world
You make your entrance
Remember this lady loves romance
So how about friendship with romance
Maybe you may stand a chance
Send me sweet roses once in a while
Make it your number one style
I need you now, not as a lover
If that is your immediate aim
You’ll be sucked out of my life with a hover
So how about friendship with romance
Now and then, take me out to dance
Hypnotise me, enchant me in a trance
With words and your exquisite rainbow smile
Don’t just tell me, ‘you fancy me’
I’ll buzz these words to you like a bee
Go take a hike by the sea
Till you roast and dry
So you want a taste of my
Rosy, cushy, juicy delicious pie
I’m afraid, without romance on supply
This refined lady is not going to comply
You have no money! That’s no excuse
There are so many different ways to amuse
I love romance
I eat romance
I sleep romance
Send me little sweet notes
Put them in a bottle
Out in the sea to float
I love romance with a passion
Mesmerise me with some imagination
Don’t try pushy or bushy
There is simply no chance without romance
Of the sweet taste
Of my rosy, cushy, juicy delicious pie
