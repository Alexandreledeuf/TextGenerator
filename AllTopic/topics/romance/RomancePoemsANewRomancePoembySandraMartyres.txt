She watched him from the shadows
Too shy to say 'hi' she was still suffering
From teenage gawkiness and feared
He would not return her greeting
This handsome young man who
Walked around with an air of true
Self-confidence made her even more
Diffident about even exchanging a smile
Then suddenly to her astonishment
He just turned around and smiled
Then plucking a rose he offered it to her
After that there was no turning back
A new romance was born............
