Romance is dead
It fell to the ground
With a bullet in its head
It was a cold blooded killer
That pulled the trigger
While the children played
In the park, on the swings
Poor Romance went down
Without a sound, Without a fight
It didn't stand a chance
Noone came to the funeral
It was shown up for what it was
Big Businesses Marionette
which lay beneath the soil
Along with Romeo and Juliet
It never lived happily every after
In careless abandonment
It chose instead
To die beside Heathcliff
On a dampened bed
