Maybe a little romance is needed
Lightening our days in all this grey
To place a smile on our faces
You can't have too much romance
In a life that's filled with sadness
Making us laugh with pleasure
Give me romance to dazzle me
To make my heart sing out loud
And make me feel I'm alive
Bring on the romance to me
It's welcome in a soul of tears
Appreciated from this coldness
Give me romantic words and deeds
So pleasing to my eyes and ears
Make me happy for a little while
Give me romance everytime
To make me blush and smile
Instead of all these teasing words
