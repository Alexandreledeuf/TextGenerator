Life is full of enterprise and romance
It must be tested and understood at once
We are here to prove our worth and excel
Rest all may follow suit and go well
He has thought over it and assigned the role
Take it as challenge and respond to call
You may find thousands of different creatures
You got to decide where your future lies
Prove on return that you did whatever you could
You did not merely spent life for searching the food
Even thought life was proving hell and difficult
You should love to live without fear of any insult
If you determined to overcome all the hurdles
There won’t be any impact even if they come in bundles
It is part of life and must be faced as they come
Seattle it accordingly and always try to welcome
It can’t come to standstill with one or two failures
It strengthens your efforts to make it sure
The end path is chosen and pushed through
This is only truth and equally true
We must thank almighty for giving us an opportunity
Even though it is a belief and we can only think of infinity
It is afforded once only and if is lost in vain
There will be nothing left except pain
