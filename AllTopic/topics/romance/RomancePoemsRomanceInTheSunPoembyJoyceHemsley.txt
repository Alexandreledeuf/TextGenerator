Feminine...the 'dreamy' kind
every man adores her,
beautiful in summer sun
when Mr. Romance calls her.
He sings nostalgic melodies
introduced discreetly,
mellow notes to melt the heart
Bliss, when rendered sweetly.
He sends white lilies to her room
to celebrate each new occasion;
her boudoir's filled with fresh perfume
and sensuous adoration.
Golden rings upon her finger
give hope of many years to come
and unforgettable memories linger
of romance in the summer sun.
