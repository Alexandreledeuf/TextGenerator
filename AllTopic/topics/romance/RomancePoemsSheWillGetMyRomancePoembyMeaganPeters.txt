I'm hopelessly in love, every much a part of you.
I'm hopeless in love, very much apart from you.
I had your heart clenched in my hand,
I let it slip like gritty, shifty grains of sand.
I let your heart get torn apart
Comforted by another's arms.
Drifting in another's charms
while I lay lonely, torn apart.
Our endless love was beauty, a dream to be extant.
Now my fault alas folly; it's altering to extinct.
I always lived on hope,
never gave up on a chance.
Your words the stamp of denouement...
'she will get my romance'
