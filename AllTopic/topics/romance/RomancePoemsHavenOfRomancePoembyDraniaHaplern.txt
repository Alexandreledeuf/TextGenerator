Romance
came at morning
love story without end
we stole a kiss by the river
the haven of love way down in the glen
soprano voices came hither
ecstasy lingered then
with the bliss of
romance.
Only a shy young maiden was I
how could my heart ever know
that love was steadily seeping
into the innocence of my soul?
Romance
came with glory
love's fable now I pen
we fell in love one September
at a haven of love way down in the glen
your kind caress I remember
I was eager to dance
on wings of true
Romance.
