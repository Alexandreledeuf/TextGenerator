Tempered by the friction, of each others loneliness.
Brightly wooed, in our own glad glorious way.
We chasing each other, along those milky ways.
Conditions and competition, fight like mariners.
Love stars, are more dewy luminous than others.
Why separate them, a love creates poetic illusion.
A perspective, like pleasing soft melancholy music.
Happy about joyful liberation, awaking upon life.
Consequently life is also a dream, in relative ways.
Cooperation swinging in or out, of our endurance.
Farewell to daylight, we enjoy a moonlit night sky.
Ourselves no longer strangers, sing like chaffinch.
