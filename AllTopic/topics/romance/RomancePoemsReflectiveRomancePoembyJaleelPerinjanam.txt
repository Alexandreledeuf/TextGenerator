Dear, you learn by mind
Memoirs of yesterdays
Dear, know me again
I’m still loving you
April 1, your birthday
I can’t surpass that day
Even after several years
Rewind recall your worth
Whenever enfold me
Solicited deep kiss
Obvious your sparkling eyes
Pleaded for the passion
You are my marvel
Reflective romance
I can’t flight any more
My first love, my sweet love
So zeal your smell
So nice your tone
So lovely your heart
So nurture your feel
Wherever you are
I’m sure you join me
I wish for call you to
Upcoming world of love
Dear, you learn by heart
Memoirs of yesterdays
Wait on reflective romance
I still be devoted to you
