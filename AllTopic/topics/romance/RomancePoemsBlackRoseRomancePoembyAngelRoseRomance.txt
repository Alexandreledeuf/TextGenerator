Love is pain
So scars remain
Mind and body,
It's all the same
I love you now
Like I loved you then
Why do we have to just stay friends?
Is this just my fantasy
because you act like we were never meant
to be
I send you roses, they're usually white
But now that I have changed my mind,
They are blood red
You ask me why and I say
because my wrists bleed for you in the night
I sit alone in my room, listening to the music
That we used to
Then I slowly start to notice that everything
We had has come to an end
Right now I'm hurt and you don't
understand
So let go of my hand
At least until you understand
