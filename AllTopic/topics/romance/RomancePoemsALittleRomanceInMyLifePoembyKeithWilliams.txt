I cannot explain the way I feel about you
Girl, you're always on my mind
Everytime I often think of you
I get a funny feeling that
I'm so in love with you
I want to give you all my love
Let me show you that I'm real
The love that I have shall never fade away
I'm tired of being broken hearted
I need a little romance in my life
Can't you see I need little romance?
Take my hand
May I have this dance
No one can love the way that I can love
I'm telling you
I need a chance
I need a little romance in my life
