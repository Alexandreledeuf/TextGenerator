Change is life, though he loves status quo
Unwilling perhaps yet he accepts to bow
Before the authority's command for change
Coward in him fails to face powers' challange.
Inaction n indecision are inherent qualities
Practiced by bureaucrat by grace of almighty.
In romance he indulges with schemes n reforms
Loyalty n sincerity, never he follows such norms.
Romance of bureaucrat blurs any vision
That incorporates plans n their implementation.
Mismanagement n misconception are the basics
That train n teach him treachrous tricks.
He romances too with guv policy's formulation
As also its' circulation n  on it ample discussion.
