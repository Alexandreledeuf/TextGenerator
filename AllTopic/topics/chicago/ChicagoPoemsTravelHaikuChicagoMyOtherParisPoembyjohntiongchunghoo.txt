Paris
With first-rate museums, a world-famous aquarium, and miles of bike paths and trails along Lake Michigan, any time is the right time to visit the Windy City, even winter. See Chicago's forest of skyscrapers from the observation deck of the 110-story-high Sears Tower, the tallest building in North America. On the Loop's streets, find sculptures by Picasso, Miró, Chagall, and other masters, as well as cafes serving some of the country's best deep-dish pizza. At Millennium Park, a 24.5-acre urban oasis, take a spin on the skating rink and see 'Cloud Gate, ' an impressive jelly bean sculpture reflecting the city’s famed skyline.
