Your violet eyes, your black hair flying in the wind. I glance out the window and see the highway we're on. I wonder when we'll get there. to the city I've choosen to stay for college.
You spoke to me, saying we'll be there soon. You hold my hand on the seat of your truck. The truck you'll be selling, for a motorcycle. i smile, remembering how excited he was when he told me.
Chicago, that's where we're headed. It's where I need to be for college. He parks the truck finally in front of our new apartment. My other roomates aren't there yet, but they will be soon.
Chicago is gorgeous, but I'm not staying long.
Just four years and I'm gone.
