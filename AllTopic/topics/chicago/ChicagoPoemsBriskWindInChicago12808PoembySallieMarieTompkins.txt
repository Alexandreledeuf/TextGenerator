Just for a moment, I visited you in my imagination.
Words of edification swayed my soul, and drew me into your destine place.
I took in the brisk, soft, smooth wind on my face.
I enjoyed imagining being at your lake.
Snow wraps around you, and the air sings to you.
The trees are bare, however my southern soul longs to be there.
A visit is fine with me.
I heard a lot about you, can I get to know you?
Power is your song for people to be reborn.
Thanks for letting me get to know you a little bit,
I'll check with the airlines, and make sure my mind stays sharp, smart, and fit.
OH! My heart you have lit,
Brisk wind in Chicago...
