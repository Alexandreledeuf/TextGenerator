Shikaakwa was a stinky plant
In Miami/Illinois land.
When other food sources were scant,
'Twas eaten by the tribal band.
The plants did grow abundantly
Along the shores of a great lake.
When there the natives had to be,
'Twould hold noses for stinky sake.
There was a large river nearby.
Natives could leave fast in canoes.
While being there, most would ask why.
'Twas not the place that most would choose.
This place native wild onions grow,
Grew the city of Chicago.
