In Chicago, I am O'Hare,
The international airport.
I am reached by the world by air.
Biggest, busiest - brags I court.
My worst year was '79,
Taking off, Flight One Ninety One
Crashed into a runway of mine.
Hundreds on board - surviving none.
I got my name from a hero,
'Butch' O'Hare, the first flying ace
Who during World War II did go
To destiny in time and place.
ORD about me is what you see,
Cuz ORcharD Field I used to be.
