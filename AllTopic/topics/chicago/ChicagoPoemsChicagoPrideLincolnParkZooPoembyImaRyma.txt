The Lincoln Park Zoo reaches out
'Round the Chicago neighborhood,
To share of nature all about,
How human connect can be good,
Ever growing in time and place,
Spreading the truth of nature's worth,
Made better by the human race,
'Round the neighborhood, 'round the Earth.
Within the beauty of Zoo grounds,
Or in endeavors far and wide,
Bettering nature knows no bounds,
Lincoln Park Zoo is filled with pride.
Lincoln Park Zoo phenomenon,
The Pride of Chicago thrives on.
