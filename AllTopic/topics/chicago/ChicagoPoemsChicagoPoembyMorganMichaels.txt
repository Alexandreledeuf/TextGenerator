I'm goin' to Chicago
I'm goin' back that way, someday
I'm headin' back to Chicago.
I'm goin back to Chicago
And you know I mean to stay
At the Hotel Blackstone when I go.
Though winds may winge and blow
Off th' lake and freeze my face;
Though it may heavily snow
Sideways and hit ten below,
It'll be warm at my baby's place-
That much I do know.
I'm gonna' ride that old Metro
To th' museum down the way-
See Mista's Wood and Georgie Bellows, too.
There I'll sip pernod
All day
And watch the icicles grow
When I go back to Chicago.
