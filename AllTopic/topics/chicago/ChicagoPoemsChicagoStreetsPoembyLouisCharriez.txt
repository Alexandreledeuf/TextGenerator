Living a dream,
watching as the days go by.
The boys up the street watching,
as another drug buy goes down.
Everyone sharing in its poison.
Needles on the ground.
Heaven is one step from excepting,
another high flyer.
Powder, pills, liquer, its all the same.
One person will hit his knees tonight,
enjoying the rush and pain.
Remember it's not the price you pay,
but rather the enjoyment of the chase.
Go ahead and dream my borthers and sisters.
Because one day is coming,
that is never forgotten.
The day we all cry when you pass away.
