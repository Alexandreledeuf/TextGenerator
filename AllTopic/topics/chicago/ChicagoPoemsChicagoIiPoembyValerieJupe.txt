I feel the tug of life
on my apron strings
the ebb and flow
of the big city.
I feel the wilderness
letting go.
I feel awakening
a ferocity of my own.
I feel the pull of the world
on my bootstraps.
the sites I've yet to see.
I feel my skin
settling in to the skin
of the big city.
I feel my veins pumping with the life
of this new city.
I feel my tissues revitalized,
I feel the virtigo of life
swarming around me.
I feel the call
of the city
even now.
And I must go, to this new place,
and feel life, at a new pace.
