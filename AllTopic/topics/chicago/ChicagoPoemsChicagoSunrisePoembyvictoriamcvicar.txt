I was travelling the new world
and on my way from north to south
I found myself in Chicago
I saw the sunrise and forgot about you
It shone a different light
and I escaped you - there is someone else on my mind for now
It brought to light the windy city,
cold and bleak,
like the embers of you and me
I knew I was off to a better places
where the sun shines, clearing my head
there you fade with the setting sun
