People walking, freely talking of many happy days.
But then the wind begins to blow,
and all the angels let down holy snow.
City filled with children playing in the snow,
with twinkles in their eyes as they begin to throw.
Said one kid to another, 'say your prayers my dear brother.'
'Lord, ' said the kid all dressed in red,
'my name lord is, Jimmy George Fred.
Make these things which roam the streets, nice, and sweet,
or freeze off their toes, and hurt their feet. Amen! ! '
