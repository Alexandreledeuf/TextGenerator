hello mawe, if you are stil there
alive and listening
if you still have the shadow of
autumn and spring
if you still stand there beside the glass
walls of malls
staring at the thick snow beyond you
mawe, my friend, please tell me
'what does the snow of chicago tell you? '
please tell me what is it
that still bothers
the calm waters of your heart?
merry christmas.
happy new year.
why are you more silent than the snow?
