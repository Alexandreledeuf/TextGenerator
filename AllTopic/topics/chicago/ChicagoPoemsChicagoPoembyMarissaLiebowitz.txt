There is a place not far from here
A place that I must go
A place to escape all my troubles
The city of Chicago
The place I am right now
Is quite simply a living hell
But I never went to Chicago
So i guess it may be as well
But from What I've heard
It's a very exciting spot
And the place I am right now
Most definitely is not
I need to leave this aria
And I have to make it there
To create a brand new life for myself
And find a person who will care
Yes, I must go to Chicago
To get away from all my deceptions
For I have lead good people to believe
My many misconceptions
