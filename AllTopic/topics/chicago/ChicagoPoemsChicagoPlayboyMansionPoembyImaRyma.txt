I stand in Chicago's Gold Coast,
1340 North State Parkway.
Hugh Hefner (Hef)  liked me the most,
And bought me for Playboys to stray.
70 rooms for frolic fun,
With the skimpily clad bunnies,
In a classical French mansion,
A basement 'grotto, ' if you please.
I was filled with pleasures galore,
A Playboy could get anything.
Etched in Latin on the front door,
Saying, 'If you don't swing, don't ring.'
Hef left me for lure of L.A.
I'm a bunch of condos today.
