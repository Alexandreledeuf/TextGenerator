with redded toes, she's
jumping on the lake.
with steeled smoke, she
chokes the jumped rope and the
seen saw.
with a million downtown-
ish eyes, she marries Apathetic
Smile to Prejudiced Laugh.
with a heart blossomed
from a hellflower, she pats each
holying Church on the head.
with her lamp bragging,
she tiptoes to a basket noisemuchly
under its placing.
with her slip showing, she
makes loving seem no word
but
i remember softly my city
is no bigger than
my star
(May 9,1965)
