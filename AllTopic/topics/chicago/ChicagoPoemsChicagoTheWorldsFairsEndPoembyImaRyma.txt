1893 was the year.
October 28th the night.
The Chicago World's Fair was near
Ending as a great success bright.
Mayor Carter Harrison prepared
A closing speech, wise and witty.
Thanks to the speeches he had aired,
Chicago dubbed the Windy City.
No more would the Mayor speechify.
A deranged assassin did shoot
Three bullets, and the Mayor did die.
The World's Fair's grand ending went mute.
This World's Fair closed on a sad note.
The long speech unheard the Mayor wrote.
