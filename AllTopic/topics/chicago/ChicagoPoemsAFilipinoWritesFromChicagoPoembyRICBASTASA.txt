Dear Juana,
I am here in Chicago
And I have to wear a thicker jacko
It is very cold here you know
Even without the snow
I am staying with another cousin
In his apartment I chip in
As he is also renting
And I am simply gallivanting
It will take me time
To find work this time
To find work here is still hard
I have to stay longer in the pad
Could be next month perhaps
When cousin Rey gets some mishaps
I will have his work
And hold his fork
I could be working
Probably working
In the home of a Jewish American
Taking care of their old man
I have to tell you
I have to hold his big thing
While He is urinating
I have to wash his anus
And chop his huge “pus”
So it would
In the toilet flush
Just imagine how
The American dung would smell somehow
It wouldn’t smell chocolaty
As you would think it to be
I wish to come back
And forget this life’s lack
But who would pay
My debts in our country?
I wish you all well there
I will have my deals here
To earn for my dollars
And pay for my scholars.
Pray in Jesus name,
It‘s me your only flame.
