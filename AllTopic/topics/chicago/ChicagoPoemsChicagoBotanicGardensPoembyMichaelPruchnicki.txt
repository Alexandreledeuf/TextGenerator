Demons must follow
straight path
through the silver poplar grove-
wise villagers contrive twists
Lo! sacred precincts
'big smelly swamp'
Potawatomi name for place
near hardwood forest-
dinosauer gingko and winged monarchs
thrive next to the swamp
walking the dog
she pauses to look up at me-
a blizzard of scarlet and gold
autumn's splendid death-
master and canine gape in awe
