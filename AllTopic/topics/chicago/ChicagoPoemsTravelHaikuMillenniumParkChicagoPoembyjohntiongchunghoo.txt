Millennium Park Cloud Gate
our cameras freeze
a part of the millennium
Millennium Park Cloud Gate
coming out of my mouth
the millennium inside me
Millennium Park Cloud Gate
the millennium inside me cheers
on the millennium outisde
Millennium Park Cloud Gate
we freeze the millennium
with a click of our cameras
Millennium Park Cloud Gate
we stop the millennium
for a friendship picture
Millennium Park Cloud Gate
grinning at the fists
at our own faces
he throws a millenium joke
as she takes his picture
'that's the smartest guy on earth'
Millennium Park Cloud Gate
we take fist at own face pictures
in  the steel mirror
Millennium Park Cloud Gate
scowling our faces
for the picture of the millennium
Cloud Gate Steel Mirror
raising my hand up ala
statues of liberty
Chicago
With world-class museums, unparalleled food, and first-rate theater, Chicago's got a legit claim to fame. Check out one of the city's newer additions, Millennium Park, with its quirky public art and fun, warm weather activities. Start off the weekend with yoga in the park and cool off in the fountains, or catch an evening music or dance performance after eating some authentic Chicago deep dish pizza on nearby Michigan Avenue.
