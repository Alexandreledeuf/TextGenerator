I got my name, most people say,
Cuz el train tracks went round and round.
And so tiz just a friendly way
To reference me where I be ground.
But my boundaries really bode
From Lake Michigan on the east,
And then south to Roosevelt Road.
On north and west my sides are creased
By the Chicago River flow.
I'm filled with lots of old and new
Fact and fiction the world does know.
There is no end to points of view.
I am the home to quite a group -
Downtown Chicago in The Loop.
