They can be Ph.D. guides or supervisors
But I cannot be
As it is not in my lot,
They can be Ph.D. guides or supervisors
But I cannot
As because they in universities
And I in a small town but govt.-salaried college.
They without the research experience can be
But I cannot be a Ph.D. guide
And even if, I shall have to be in a look out
For probable research candidates
And they too like to approach those
Who have a control over the university staff
Otherwise the technicalities will prove burdensome
Than their Ph.D. guidance.
Even after writing a few, many have moved to foreign
As for guest faculties,
Fellowship programmes and teaching  assignments
But they are not the best,
As something depends on one's good luck too,
Something as destiny too draws it close,
You may call it fate too.
What do you want from me, what to give, you say it,
I worked on Nissim Ezekiel, Jayanta Mahahpatra and Adil Jussawalla,
I worked on Khushwant singh's columns,
I worked on the novels and short stories of D.H.Lawrence,
On his sketches, letters, prose-pieces and reviews,
I worked on contemporary Indian English poetry
And the history and tradition of it,
I worked on the terracotta temples of Chandrakona,
Dilapidating and falling, the limsestone powder and small brick built
And what do you want me to do?
