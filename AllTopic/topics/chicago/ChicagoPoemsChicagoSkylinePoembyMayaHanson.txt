If we tear it apart and I hug you too hard
maybe we can go
back to that Chicago skyline
and not worry about all the monsters and mountains we've seen here.
I'm made of feathers when you breathe out
words I've never wanted to hear
so I am crying out the dust you've left in my chest
I want to catch what you want between my teeth and give it to you
I want to dance until I can build myself back into stone
but I have never been able to dance
when you're not here.
Now I can see how we are so good at failing.
All I want is to go
back to Chicago
so we can be the girls standing where the earth meets the water,
so the tide will never rise if you stand so still,
close your eyes,
only open your mouth
to tell me this is where we belong
and I will clutch your pieces even if they draw blood from my hands,
make me believe we are surviving and
you will never fade again.
If I can't take you with me
I will paint you into the Chicago skyline.
