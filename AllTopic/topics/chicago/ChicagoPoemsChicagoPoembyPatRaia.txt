Going home
means
warmth and
family and
work and
friends
since childhood
It means
being someplace
that
never changes
at least
in my mind
But in
my haste
I sold
the house
and
gave up
the job
The childhood
friends all
grew up
and
the family
died off
Now
there is
no home
to go to
