We're twins - and the most famous in
Downtown Chicago River side.
Sixty story tower - each twin.
Half minute elevator ride.
A corn cob appearance times two.
Apartments - cut pieces of pie,
Each one having a stunning view
Of the Windy City nearby.
Many movies and T.V. shows
Have featured us in varied scene.
Most famous is the car that goes
River splash with us 'twixt and 'tween.
Both of us still sitting pretty,
Rise above Marina City.
