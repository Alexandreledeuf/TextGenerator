Of Compton I'm not the least bit afraid!
To the thought of Chicago I drink cool aide or lemonade!
Cosa Nostra, by them I could never die!
The FBI, like standing next to a fly
Harmless! No chess move! Truth is, I'm immortal peace!
My life, like the universe, will never decease! - Joshua Aaron Guillory
