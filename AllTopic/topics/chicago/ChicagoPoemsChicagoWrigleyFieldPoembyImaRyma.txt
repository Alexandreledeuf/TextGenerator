I was built in 1914
On a Chicago city block.
Wrigley Field had come to the scene,
Where Cubs baseball fever would rock.
Some decades later, ivy grew
Famously on my outfield walls.
Baseball officials made me do
Lights later for the night game balls.
Corner of Clark and Addison,
My main entry marquee does call
Of welcome to some magic fun,
The Friendly Confines beckon all.
Oh when, oh when will ever be
A World Series be played in me?
