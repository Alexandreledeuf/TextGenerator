Write I
The poetry of
Los Angeles,

Seattle,
Miami,
Atlanta,
Savannah,
Detroit,
Baltimore,
Portland,
Oklahoma,
Cincinnati,
Write I.
Their vibes, life and culture,
Urbanity and modernity,
Dress and city culture,
Idiosyncrasies and nuances
Of the language,
Styles and manners,
Etiquette and behaviour,
Take I a note of
While striding,
Passing through,
Viewing them,
For my poetic medium
Of expression,
Catching the rhythm of life,
Venting my feelings.
