Stop me if...
The story is,
The Queen visited our local
Old Folks' Home (well, it's called The Senior Enclave now...)
and walking along the wheelchair line, drawn up
like some parking lot along the promenade
but without the view
stopped at one old dear who looked
as if she hadn't quite got the point of this unwelcome
change to routine, and said
(in case the old darling regretted later
she'd missed the great occasion)
'Do you know who I am? '
'No dear - but ask the nurse,
she'll tell you...'
