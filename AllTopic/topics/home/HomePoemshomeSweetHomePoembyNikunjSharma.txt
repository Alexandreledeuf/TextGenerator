A sea of defunct toys
Canvas of walls smeared
with colors of joy;
patterns of art;
Designs, that god only can understand
Love filled books, can't confine
themselves to shelves, pop
out every now and then,
Rest on pillow.
Clothes say - hey, in that
ugly closet who wants to stay!
slippers not far behind
stay on standby all the time
little princess may need them
anytime.
Love finds itself
sprinkled everywhere
in wet hands on the wall,
in larger than life footprints
on invisible floor.
chocolate stained sofa too
smiles at you.
The pen runs out of ink
every time you need it.
Blank pages of my diary
are history too....
Coins from my wallet, attached
by the piggy bank, that has
mortgaged the doll's house.
Happily the barbie pays back
Installment by installment
Love, that has gone into
making her home up.
Out in the balcony
arm chairs sit alone through
the day, waiting for the next
morning tea; when the lazy love
shall float around them, amidst the
rain sprinkles.
sweet nothings
formless;
yet form foundations.
