I want my own home
A home I’ll long to be in it
A home where there is real peace
A home I can get into
Anytime I wanted too
With the doors wide open
A home with a TV
A TV I can watch on
As long as I can
A home with a radio
Where I can play in full audio
To its loudness I can bear
A home with foods
Though it’s quite few
But will never be accounted
A home where me and my child
Can play around without restriction
Laugh with no inhibitions
A simple home I’ve wanted to
But too hard to be mine
Too hard to be called mine
