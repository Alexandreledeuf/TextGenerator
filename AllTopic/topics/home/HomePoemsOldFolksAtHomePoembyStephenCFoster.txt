1     Way down upon de Swanee ribber,
2     Far, far away,
3     Dere's wha my heart is turning ebber,
4     Dere's wha de old folks stay.
5     All up and down de whole creation,
6     Sadly I roam,
7     Still longing for de old plantation,
8     And for de old folks at home.
9     [Chorus] All de world am sad and dreary,
10   Ebry where I roam,
11   Oh! darkeys how my heart grows weary,
12   Far from de old folks at home.
13   [Solo] All round de little farm I wandered
14   When I was young,
15   Den many happy days I squandered,
16   Many de songs I sung.
17   When I was playing wid my brudder
18   Happy was I --.
19   Oh! take me to my kind old mudder,
20   Dere let me live and die.
21     [Chorus] All de world am sad and dreary,
22   Ebry where I roam,
23   Oh! darkeys how my heart grows weary,
24   Far from de old folks at home.
25   One little hut among de bushes,
26   One dat I love,
27   Still sadly to my mem'ry rushes,
28   No matter where I rove
29   When will I see de bees a humming
30   All round de comb?
31   When will I hear de banjo tumming
32   Down in my good old home?
33     [Chorus] All de world am sad and dreary,
34   Ebry where I roam,
35   Oh! darkeys how my heart grows weary,
36   Far from de old folks at home
