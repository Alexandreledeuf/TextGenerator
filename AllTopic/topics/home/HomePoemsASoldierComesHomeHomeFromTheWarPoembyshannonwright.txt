a soldier coming home
he gets off the bus and looks around
families are being reunited
and lovers are kissing
all are unfamiliar faces.
he grabs his bag
and goes to the nearest payphone.
soon a cab pulls up and takes
him to a motel.
he has no one to welcome him
and no place to call home.
as he lays his head down to sleep
a tear slides from his cheek to a pillow
he feels so alone.
he doesn’t realize
that a thousand miles away
there’s a girl crying.
wishing she had been there
to welcome him home.
Home from the war.
