Home permanent home
You may welcome
If you have decent home
Greet each other
And gracefully offer
It takes time
To build in life time
Sometimes it may not be realized
And you will see it as dazed
But life moves on
Despite many things in life are got or won
The home remains as distant possibility
In your prayers you always bow down to almighty
The birds to build nest
And put their efforts best
They leave it the moment their job is over
But we miss it and need some shelter
Love demands one permanent refuge
And it is not desire huge
It gets reality
And makes smooth real journey
