Oh how I miss those walks in the park,
where birds would sing and dogs did bark.
Nuts for the pigeons and some for the squiriels,
swan boats dfift by leaving watery swirls.
Happy laughter of children floated by as on wings,
playing with friends and soaring on swings.
People walked by, some nodded or smiled,
young folk gave agreeting, others chatted awhile.
Remembering all this fills me with joy.
Now it's, here take your pills, oh that's a good boy.
