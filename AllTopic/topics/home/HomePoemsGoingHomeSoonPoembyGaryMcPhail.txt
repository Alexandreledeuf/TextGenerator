Pushed and pulled ‘til torn apart
Unprepared for a broken heart
Never feel the pain that’s hidden
To share my emotions is forbidden.
Keep it quiet keep it safe,
Never hear the voice that speaks.
In a hole dig it deep
personality
Has gone six feet.
Revenge is dreamt when I sleep
death is near when I wake
In hell I’ll be for I will sin
being punished for my deed
I will see that its wrong
Suicide is my way home.
