I see you there standing alone
So lonely, so broken
Hollow inside you search
Search for a guide
To take you to unknown places
To Comfort you, to hold you close
To take you home
Your face stays emotionless
Your eyes stay fixed to the wall
No sign of life
But yet you look so life-like
With your rosy cheeks
And your joyful smile
Come home, Come home with me
I’ll comfort you, I’ll hold you
So tightly, so lovingly
I’ll take you to unknown places
I’ll let you stay forever
We’d play games
We’d dance and sing
We’d share secrets
We’d be best friends
Still you sit there,
Alone and unhappy
Still with the same hollow smile
Still with eyes of no emotion
That’s when I realised
This figure was not my friend
Nor could it be
It couldn’t play games
Couldn’t dance nor sing
Couldn’t have secrets
And sadly
It couldn’t be my best friend
Because it was;
A thing of no life
A thing of pure hollowness
A thing that couldn’t live
Nor die..
I leave you alone
And go home
Wishing I had stayed
Wishing we could be friends
But we couldn’t
Because you weren’t real
You were just a plastic doll
