On the way home
I came from a journey
On the way home
I took the train
On  the way home while I was sitting in the chair
I saw my love....my crush... I couldnt help but stare
This time I didnt care what people thought
I had to be with you someday, someway
People can say whatever
but they cant break what we built
On the way home
I was all alone
But i knew what i felt along the way
gazing into the city
nothing amuzes me like him
Cars drive by
Lights shine bright
but I dont really stop and look
Its all about me and him soon....
