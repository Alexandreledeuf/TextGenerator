Dream with pain from you
Awake with pain from you
I'm afraid to be alone
I'm afraid to stay at home
Gather myself to fall again
I'm better off dead
Then breathing until the end
On second thought, maybe instead
This is me, I'm so pathetic
Let the world hear me cry
Let them know I'm an addict
Let them know I won't die
I'll crawl through that familiar door
I'm so sick of this place
I've seen this all before
It's uglier then my face
Dream with pain from you
Awake with pain from you
I'm afraid to be alone
I'm afraid to stay at home.
