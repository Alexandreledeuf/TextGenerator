I created you,
Gave you various forms,
With unique finger prints,
Exclusive features,
Variety of relationships,
Different thought processes,
Of an infinite GB memory,
With immense potentials,
Of procreating nature,
With cloning and  nanotechnologies;
But you yourselves,
My dear ignorant children…
Have still assigned me
Different names
With different forms,
And quarrel amongst you,
Considering me as
DIFFERENT!
While I stay here
As a perplexed parent,
Watching…
Your childish fights,
Patiently teaching you
The ways of this world,
Since eras…….! ! !
