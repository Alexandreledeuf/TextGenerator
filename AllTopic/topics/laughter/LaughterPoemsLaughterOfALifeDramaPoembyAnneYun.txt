The late afternoon sun slants down in the corner
where grandpa stands always to against his winter
simmering still, in his folded wrinkles, pure age's laughter
laughter, every time in a glimpse, we giggle together
till the eyes full of water
till the water stirring with more laughter
laughing in another corner, my dear grandma
secretly collects this again to her life drama
