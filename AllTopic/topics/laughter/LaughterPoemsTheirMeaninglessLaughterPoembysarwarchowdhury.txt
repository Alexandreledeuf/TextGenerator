The other day I had had, The smell of spellbound emitted from her love, That made me sorrowful and as a dead man later on, But the blooming flowers were laughing and told at last- 'You  are in a state of being intoxicated...try to get out of obsession.'
My question was to them-
Do you know that scientist Einstein were fall in love too?
They again laugh and laugh, Meaningless laughter.
I was inflamed and so shouted- 'stop your laughter, You are  emitting illusions too, I know.
