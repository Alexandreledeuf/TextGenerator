the shell of a snail
long since departed....
ghosts whisper, cannot touch!
layers of anger
devouring from within,
till nothing is left but dust.
flesh cries out for flesh,
old or young, doesnt matter.
water seeks itself, stone is stone.
a lover, a small fire
too far away to name....
and God's face is lost
in the laughter!
