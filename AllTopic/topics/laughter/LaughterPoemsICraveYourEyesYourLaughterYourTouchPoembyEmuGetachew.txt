I crave your eyes, your laughter, your touch
I crave the smile of your eyes
the warmth of your breath
the scent of your eyelids
and the kindness of your touch.
I crave the opening of your lips
the agreement between your smile and your tears
I crave, I crave the voice in your laughter
the melodies of your finger tips
and the dialect of your eyes.
I crave your eyes, your laughter, and your touch
without it, I am the sound of an empty journey
without it, i am the missing petals of spring gardens,
without it, i am the tears of winter clouds,
without it, i am a woman without her skin.
