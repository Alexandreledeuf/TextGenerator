TEARS AND LAUGHTER
Our life gets ensconced between our
laughter and tears,
With sunshine and rain, between our
joys and fears!
This life is a filigree of light and shadow
play,
While with our laughter we try  to drive
our fears away!
All our exalted emotions, bring tears to our
eyes,
But tears can flow freely, while laughter
needs tears to survive!
Laugh and the world laughs with you,
But when you weep, you weep alone!
The world has no time for your sorrow, -
it remains as your  very own!
Life’s music is composed with our happiness
and pain,
Tears provide the somber background notes,
And laughter the lilting cadence of summer’s rain!
But in this single life, if we can wipe our brother's
tears,
Happiness will follow, to drive away our tears!
