Laughter
Mole-like token let it be bestowed on you
Laughter
Bell-like liquid an outpour light and blue
Laughter
The joyful cords in music born blessed throats
Laughter
The happy rowing in plenitude golden boats
Laughter
Running wild shaking bellies to dance
Laughter
Sweet disease swell infective trance
Laughter
The tongue tip peeping to mock the hands of time
Laughter
The gift of he’s she’s of you’re we’re or I’m
Laughter
The blissful eyes when joyful tears go down
Laughter
The king or queen carrying the highest crown
