Laughter the best of human tendencies and outlet of emotions
One cannot avoid laughter throughout his life
The individual who is incapable to laugh in such feelings
That makes the mind in humor and happiest and best of moods
May be somewhat wrong in his mindset so says the learnt ones
Laughter a perfect  mechanism and outlet to vanish tension
Stresses and strains of human feelings we have to avoid
So laugh so much when you feel it good and in such mind
No one is bothered to question your freedom of laughter
But always keep the laughing with pure awareness
Without making negative feelings to the nearer ones
The most successful men of world leaders and intellectuals
Were capable to laugh in good spirit and making other happy
The secrecy behind their success being the laughter
Follow their ways of tendencies of expressions of laughter
The real success will be to you no doubt remember.
