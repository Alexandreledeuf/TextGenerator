The gift of laughter is a rare gift it is such a wonderful thing
And laughter can create more laughter to it there is such a beautiful ring
The people who laugh seem to make friends quite easily and in numbers their friends seem to grow
But the people who take life too seriously are the people few wish to know.
The woman next door is a laugher she has with her a winning way
She is one who makes friends quite easily she always smiles and says good day
A person like her is worth knowing she spreads around her gift of cheer
For to stimulate laughter in her heart she doesn't need spirits or beer.
Compared to her the bloke three doors down is so different a smile never does cross his face
He is always so serious looking perhaps laughter he cannot embrace
A good laugh would be so good for him since none look more serious than he
If everyone took life so serious how boring a thing life would be.
The gift of laughter is a great gift and with it there's none to compare
And the people with it are invaluable since they spread it around everywhere
Life seems far too short to be grumpy since we will be forever dead
And feel grateful for people who can laugh their happiness they seem to spread.
