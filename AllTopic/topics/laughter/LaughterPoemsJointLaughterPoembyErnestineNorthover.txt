We laugh at the same funny things,
Our quick sense of humour just springs
From being together,
Whatever the weather,
It's wonderful what such laughter brings.
We can each see the funny side, that's true,
But of course we can sometimes be blue,
But if one of us is down,
Then the others a clown
Enticing a smile to break through.
Sometimes, when we're both very tired,
And we feel that we're electrically wired,
Something just makes us smile,
And after a while,
We can laugh, which is just what's required.
I won't say there's not sadness in life,
But try looking beyond all the strife,
We keep smiling along,
Till the sadness has gone,
That's the delight of being 'husband and wife'.
