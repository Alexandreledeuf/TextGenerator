When the laughter stops
~
And what when the laughter stops
Do we care to ask
Those clowns and entertainers
Once the curtain has fallen
Is there still joy, rhapsody
Or the emptiness of a still room
Do they cry or call for help
What happens when the laughter stops
It's not a question I hear often
But is a relevant as the time of day
Were the world indeed a stage
And we each designated a role to play
Those jesters how we love them so
In their masks and acts
What happens when the laughter stops
Still we do not ask
