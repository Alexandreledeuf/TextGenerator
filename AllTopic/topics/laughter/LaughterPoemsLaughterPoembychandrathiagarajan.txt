Laughter  is  a  unique  quality  endowed  to  mankind;
It  is  completely  denied  to  the  animal  mind.
When  humour  is  dwelt  upon  and  reared,
There   emanates  laughter  and  is  shared.
Roaring   laughter  is  contagious,
And  humour  is  surely  infectious.
Laughter   escalates  hilarity  and  happiness,
And  humour  diminishes  weariness.
One  can  laugh  at  a  joke,  ridiculous,
And  can  scoff  at  another  one,  meticulous.
One  needs  to be  like  a  child,  so  jolly,
Egoless  and  innocent  to laugh  so  merrily.
Laughter  requires  a  bit  of  intelligence,
As  well  as  presence  of  mind  and  good  sense.
Benefits  of  laughter  are  numerous,
It  bestows  a  wealth  of  health  on  us.
Laughter  boosts  the  immunity  system,
And  lowers  the  stress  hormone  item.
With  laughter  the  whole  body  is  relaxed,
And  gnawing  pain  for  a  time  is  axed.
Laughter  prevents  even  the  heart  disease,
And  a  sorrowful  mood  is  made  to  ease.
With  a  chuckle  feel-good  endorphins  are  released,
And  with  a  peal  of  laughter  one  is  pleased.
Laughter  adds  joy  and  zest  to  life,
And  eases  anxiety,  fear  and  strife.
Laughter  helps  conflicts  to  diffuse,
And  mirth  in  one   it  does  suffuse.
Laughter  is  a  resource  for  problem  surmounting,
And  has  the  power  for  good  relationship  enhancing.
Humour  lightens  one's  burdens;
Inspires  hope  and  the  outlook  broadens.
So  let  us  enjoy  humour  and  guffaw  heartily,
And  let  us  blend  laughter  into  our  lives  verily.
