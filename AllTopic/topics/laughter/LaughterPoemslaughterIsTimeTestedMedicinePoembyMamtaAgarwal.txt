People may not be laughing
All the way to the banks,
But going by SMS AND JOKES,
Still some have humour intact.
What if many have closed shop
And filed for bankruptcy,
As they are on the verge
Of going broke and hungry.
All streets-Wall or Dalal-
Bears are roaming freely
Its there day out-
Bulls have retreated meekly.
Who are Lehman Brothers?
What’s all the fuss about?
Are they fighting over property
Is it a family feud?
Your Standard has become Poor,
you are rightly feling Moody and blue,
and baffled left wondering
how come no one had a clue.
Pink slips and pay cuts
Are handed everyday.
All you can do is to
Keep calm and pray.
Well fellows, it’s time
To deeply  ponder and reflect,
And ensure now that
Every penny is well spent.
Simple living and high thinking
Is gaining on the popularity charts.
Staying afloat in tough times
Is no less than a survival art.
How about giving a miss to the Malls
And looking for a past time,
Other than drooling at dressed windows
For no reason or rhyme.
Every difficulty is an opportunity,
(THE WISE SAY)     in disguise.
Put away those swanky cars,
Don’t feel so demoralised.
Walk to work if you still have one
Shed all that extra weight.
And look like million bucks,
As a bonus you will have a clear head.
The roads will be
Free of traffic snarls and cars,
Pollution will come down
Bust goes the business of oxygen bars.
Everything happens for a reason,
Oft I have heard it mentioned.
Till people realise what is unnecessary consumption,
Long live the  bears and the recession.
