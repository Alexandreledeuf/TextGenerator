Joe Lightheart
was his name,
being jolly
his claim to fame-
He'd laugh at this
he'd laugh at that,
he'd laugh from his boots
up to his hat-
From the day of his birth
he'd always laugh and smile,
to hear or tell a joke
he'd gladly walk a mile-
No news was too bad
no opinion too sour,
his joy was unbreakable
hour upon hour-
That is until the fateful day when he laughed
at his wife in her new dress,
now poor Joe cannot even offer up a smile...
his broken teeth are such a mess-
