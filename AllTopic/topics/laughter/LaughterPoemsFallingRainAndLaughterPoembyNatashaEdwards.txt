Rain falls from heaven and we catch it on our tongues
We laugh a proper laugh
Noses are cold
Hand stuffed in pockets to keep off the chill
We laugh a proper laugh
Walking and talking
We laugh a proper laugh
A boat passes and we stand still to watch
It passes us by
Like the years since your first cry
And we laugh a proper laugh
Sticks are thrown
Flowers are picked
And we laugh a proper laugh
We walk heads flung back mouths wide open
To catch
Rain that falls from heaven
