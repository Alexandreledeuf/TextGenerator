'Laughter is the best medicine, '
To everyone, this is well known,
But now-a-days, it's rarely seen
'Cause of more stress and strain.
In the good olden days,
There were royal ways,
For a king's laughter,
Got thro' a Court Jester.
To a Joker's club,
Or a Theatre pub,
One has to go today,
For buying one's joy.
Anger leads one to tension,
And laughter to relaxation,
But still why one chooses frustration,
Paying health a little attention?
It's said, 'An apple a day
Keeps the doctor away, '
Why a free-laugh, daily one can't try,
Rather going for an apple to buy?
This way one can be happy,
To lead a long life healthy,
And can grow further wealthy,
No more medicines, no more worry.
