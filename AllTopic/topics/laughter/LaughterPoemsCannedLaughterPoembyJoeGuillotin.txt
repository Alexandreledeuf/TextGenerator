It makes me want to laugh
sawing a girl in half
and missing the mark
a bomb going off
in the middle of the park
a bird flying in an ocean of blue
hitting a pane of glass
invisible to view
It makes me want to laugh
telling them its showers
when its actually gas
when lullabies are sung for babies
who are perched precariously
on the limbs of trees
It makes me want to laugh
Those who believe in some great reward
when their next-door neighbor has a body stored
under freshly cemented foundation
But in all of creation...
It makes me want to laugh
when we blow up points on a map
on one man's behalf.
leaving thousands dead
It makes me want to laugh.
But I'll think I'll cry now instead.
