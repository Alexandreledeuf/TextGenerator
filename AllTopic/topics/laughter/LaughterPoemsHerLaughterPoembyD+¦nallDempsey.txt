Tenderly
I set the trap
with words
to catch
the flight of her
laughter.
Her laughter
flew up into the air
turned into
an enormous bouquet
each petal
a butterfly
until my mind
fluttered with each
delicious delight
and the room
became a gilded box
that housed
the treasure of her
laughter
floating out of
the window
until it touched
the stars.
