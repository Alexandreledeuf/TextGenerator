Let get laughter way out of  yourself
Make the happy sound awake
Laughter magic and enchanting
Don't sustain it in your soul
Let yourself go into joy
May it help forever
People from wherever
Getting circled together
Laughter can be a kind of help
A worthy enemy to distress
Rise this laughter so dear
To be heard by human ears
Make it go on around the world
Little chuckles happy giggles
So many ways of laughing
Don't fear the others comment
Let laughter way out of yourself
Be assured laughter is magic
Open your heart to this very
Very special kind of sound
Let get laughter way out of yourself
Make the happy sound awake
