Smiling faces beam of summer warmth
Greeting of jokes and cordial words
Handshakes from outstretched hands
Kisses from pursed lips of pretty faces
Are the greeting from our friends
And melt any coolness of the heart
Loneliness of previous years
Fade like forgotten memories
Friendship is a beautiful thing
Something that can never be replaced
No sorrow, no sadness to furrow the brow
Only smiles and laughter surround us now
