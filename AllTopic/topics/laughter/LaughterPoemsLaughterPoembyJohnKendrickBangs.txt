WORRY stalked along the road,
Trouble sneaking after;
Then Black Care, and Grief, and Goad
Enemies to Laughter.
But old Laughter with a shout
Rose up and attacked 'em;
Put the sorry pack to rout,
Walloped *em and whacked 'em.
Laughter frivols day and night ;
Sometimes he's a bubble,
But he hath a deal of might
In a bout with Trouble!
