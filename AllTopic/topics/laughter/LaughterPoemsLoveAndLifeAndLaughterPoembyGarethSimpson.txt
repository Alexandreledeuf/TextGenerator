How glorious new beginnings are
Of love and life and laughter
You made your wish, you caught a star
It's happy ever after
The love that's yours is immense
It's only worthless things your losing
No more sitting on the fence
There's no better path for choosing
The light you have beside of you
It guides you from uncertainty
You'll no longer be asking who
You'll be sharing with eternity
When the darkness falls from up above
You'll be shining like a star so bright
Because you've found your own true love
You'll shine on through the night
