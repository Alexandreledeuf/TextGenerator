Laughter is life
- - - - - - - - - - -
The show must go on;
And so is our life
With laughter
It always shines
Youth comes to age
Without much strife
And it’s laughter
That makes life’s pilgrimage
Better and steadier
The flower fades
The music breaks
And the falsehood masquerades
But the laughter stays and invigorates
Life youthful and divine with grace
With laughter heart-aches disappear
And minds free from stress and fear
See a flower with laughter
Always happy and happier
A butterfly upon a flower
A cloud in the sky
While dissolving in showers
And a wave in sea splashing the shore
And the laughter with us
Dissolving in happiness more
And shall endeavour
To make life mightier and healthier
Oh soul, laugh and be merry
For that’s the golden way
Life can be lived sweeter and stronger...........
