Yes, her laughter rang hollow
but they stayed right behind,
one good reason to follow
was that some were quite blind.
Ah, we hate the assertive
in  a woman at that,
throwing glances so furtive
at her dress and her hat.
If we look past our noses
we may see a bit more;
even tulips and roses
may appeal to a boar.
It's a boomerang's giggle
as it homes in on you
will you dance, will you wiggle
or go hide in the loo?
