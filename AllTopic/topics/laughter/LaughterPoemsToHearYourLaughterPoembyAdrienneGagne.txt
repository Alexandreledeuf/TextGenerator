Just to hear your laughter,
I would throw myself off the highest cliff
on the western coast
And as the waves carried my broken body away
I would turn my head back in your direction
Because after everything we have been through,
The pain
The tears
The sacrifices
The goodbyes
I need to know that you will always be laughing
Right before the ocean pulls me below the surface for good
The wind catches the faint sound of your voice
You are laughing so hard
I can practically picture the tears of joy
streaming down your face.
Darkness follows
and there is nothing left but a broken body filled with memories
Finally, amidst the saltwater and seaweed
You are free,
and so am I.
