If you need to heal what ales ya
go and laugh a hour or so.
Then all your aches and troubles will flee
you'll be much better off you know.
Take some time to make a funny face
that's all ya need to do.
Then someone might be watching
and they'll make one back at you!
Find a funny movie
go and share it with a friend
Then all your problems won't seem so large
and maybe they will even end?
See the brighter side of things
it's better then the dark.
Let one fly in a grocery store
go ahead let it rip, and give the world a fart!
Laugh you fool laugh and run
for the store managers after you.
See I made you laugh didn't I
that was all I was trying to do!
