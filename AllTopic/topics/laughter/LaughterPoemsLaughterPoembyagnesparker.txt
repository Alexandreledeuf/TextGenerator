I love to get a dance right.
When a dance does go wrong
makes me laugh uncontrollably.
I hold my sides -
I am convulsed with laughter,
I am literally paralyzed,
I see people befuddled,
looking utterly lost.
they are wandering around aimlessly,
or rooted to the spot
like a deer caught in headlights.
No joke makes me laugh uncontrollably.
Yes, I may guffaw, I may laugh -
but uncontrollable laughter,
deep purging,
healing laughter,
happens  very-very seldom in my life.
But it happened in my last  dance.
I was convulsed with laughter -
convulsed is the only correct word.
How often, in life, are you convulsed in laughter? -
and of course, being convulsed,
I was clogging up the middle,
causing further confusion.
