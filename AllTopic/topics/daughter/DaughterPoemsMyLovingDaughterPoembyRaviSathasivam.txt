A treasure and blessings for us from our God
to have you as a  wonderful and sweet daughter
You bring us a special joy and charm
and fills happiness around our home
Your smile does brighten our days and set us free
Your hugs and kisses make our hearts melt
There is no life without you and you are everything to us
Years have gone so quickly and brought so much changes in you
But your every experiences have left us to remember you forever
We are proud to be your parents and its the best ever we have felt
Sometime you make naughtiness and we go crazy
but silently we enjoy when you tease us and others
You are the beautiful child we brought you on this world for reason
To love and teach you right from wrong and protect from sins
No matter what, God will keep us together forever
That will be the best of our family can be.
