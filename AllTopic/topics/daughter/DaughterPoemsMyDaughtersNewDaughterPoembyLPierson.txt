My daughter’s new daughter
How precious and sweet
Beautifully perfect
From her head to her feet
Ten tiny fingers
And ten tiny toes
All dressed up in lace
With a cute button nose
I look at her face
And I see her bright smile
I have to admit
Takes me back quite awhile
I remember the day
Brought my own daughter home
More precious than anything
I’d ever known
My daughter’s new daughter
How precious and sweet
Beautifully perfect
From her head to her feet
