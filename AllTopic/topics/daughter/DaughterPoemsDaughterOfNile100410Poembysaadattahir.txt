Pair of warmest, shiny, amber eyes.
See through deceit and alluring lies.
Fairest damsel in rank and file.
A gem, a jewel, the daughter of Nile.
Cultured, enigmatic, vivacious smile.
Ready to help and go that mile.
The Nile inside dances and bubbles a song.
Like its water that means no wrong.
Deep springs well inside, twitter the birds.
The depth of heart not given to words.
Her demeanor; brings forth many a sighs.
Knows the darkest spots on MRIs.
For millennia the sphinx, a muted guard!
Patiently waited for bint e Ra'ad.
Glides the corridors and keeps her own.
In the finest tradition to pick no bone.
Skewered aside, chivalrous nouveau-riche,
Sends them packing without a glitch.
Knows her radiology and her place.
Unarmingly detaches from creed or race.
The Arabian Oryx walks the shifting dune.
A hope for the traveler is the desert moon;
that rises by the sea, in Domyat's fold.
Spreading its color in charming gold.
Ya! aiyoun'el Maha wa ghina ‘el bahar.
Aj'ab-nee ghareeb wa ghalafnee bis s'har.
Aariftee wa fahamtee qooaat'el saba.
Mawjooda fi aayee tareek wa qullo rehaa.
Qutulnee ba ayoonukee bedoon'er rehma.
Ishh hina qalm, jaamid...heeya ma fehma.!
(From the few words u spoke to me….
The few looks you sent my way….
And many many times when my eyes followed you….silently….surely…!)
