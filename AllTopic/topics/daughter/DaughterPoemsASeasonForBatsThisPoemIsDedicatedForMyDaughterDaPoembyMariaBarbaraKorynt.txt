this dream is beginning in the street when at night
carefully I am looking at the more and more dark sky
and suddenly I see creatures some strange are flying
degenerated though similar to reptile-birds
there is a season starting from today, a strange man is saying,
of bats which, here are just arriving
I am looking with fear, when are landing on the pavement
it looks like the blooming lawn now with May
only there are completely different flowers here
abdomens from the thin cuticle slippery pale
they are a matter of concern - not harmless associations
and backs covered with shining feathers
black and are gleaming the same as shoes applied shoe polish to
one of them is trying already to attack me
kind of I was sentenced to the eternal penance
but my subconscious ordered me to plan
the one, entire slimy covered with thick glue
it wants to me probably to stick already forever
violently I am  pushing out and I am making a success of it
the coating on my forearm is staying
of still shining of his black wing
this situation transfixed me and  become repulsive
when with morning dawn then again I am looking into the mirror
into the window - I am pale, still empty street
