God created daughter,
With special love and care.
She is a precious treasure,
Ushers in our life luck and flair.
HE blesses them with divine nectar,
To bloom them with laugh and laughter,
Arrival of a daughter,
Showers divine pleasure.
Love and happiness she showers,
Towering Druga in her grandeur,
Vibrant preserver and protector of culture,
Future mother, wife and sister,
In all the wonders, she is the best,
Mother earth is too short to give her rest.
