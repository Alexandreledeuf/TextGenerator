For the love of daughter
That I cherish as a father
The daughter I prayed to God for
Those many years ago
My heart is sad and lonely
In this place that I call home
We have experienced some good times
We have gone through some bad times too
For the love of a daughter
The girl I always wanted
The daughter that I love so
The one who filled my life with joy
The one that filled my heart with pride
The one who has no way of knowing
The tears that I have shed
I can only wonder what I have done
That has turned her heart so cold
For the love of a daughter
There will be forgiveness
As precious as she is
To this Fatherâ€™s heart
I can only love her
As much as I can
