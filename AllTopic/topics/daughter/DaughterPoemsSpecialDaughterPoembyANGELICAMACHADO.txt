You always bring me that special joy
That comes from deep inside
That every year that passes by
Your more special than before
Through every stage through every age
I love you even more.
Your a very special daughter to me
That words can describe
And I know sometimes Im so hard on you
And it hurts me to see you cry.......
I have always tried to be there for you
In every way
I'am the proudest mom by far to say.
My how the years have flown
Now look my little angel your all grown
No matter what happens
You will always be my only little girl.
