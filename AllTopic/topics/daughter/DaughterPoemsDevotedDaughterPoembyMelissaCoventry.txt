Do it as daddy says,
Do that even without ask,
Do it with high expectation,
Do it better, do to… perfection.
With mouth shut,
And feet patting silently,
On these cold tiled floors.
Do it for daddy. And when asked what you’re doing?
Answer exactly as daddy asked?
But never speak up over your whisper,
Or look up at the stars,
Princess, time for bed now,
Do as you’re told.
Ok… ok… goodnight dad.
