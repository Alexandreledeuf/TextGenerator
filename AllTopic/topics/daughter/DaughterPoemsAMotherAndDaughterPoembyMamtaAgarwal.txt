At 15, taking a stroll with my mother
On a cool summer night after dinner,
Ma, one question always nags my mind
What is it she softly asked, my child?
How can one spend a life time with one man?
Doesn’t it get boring after a short span?
As we sat on the bench, she looked at me
Yes, it needs commitment we don’t foresee.
In the first flush of love when you are getting acquainted
You love everything as you are smitten and infatuated.
But slowly it begins to sink that nobody is perfect
We have feet of clay, disillusioned you come to accept.
But as you come to know each other better,
And are growing up and raising a family together.
You are overcome with love, respect and acceptance
And enjoy each other’s company even in silence.
Her words resound, although she is no more,
As I wait for my man to come through the door.
I owe her my life and celebrate each and everyday
To this day, she soothes and shows me the way.
