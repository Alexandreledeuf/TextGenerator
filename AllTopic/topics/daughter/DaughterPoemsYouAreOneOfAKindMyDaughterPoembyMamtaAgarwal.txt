The moment you were born, you announced
Your arrival in our family, screaming out loud
Now that I am here, attention is my birth right.
Of course, we catered to you day and night.
No sooner had the nurse brought you
And put you in my arms, I knew
As you looked at me from your yellow
Bonnet, you were going to be a handful.
Once you brought the roof down
At midnight, and just to drown
Your screams, your dad put on rock music
To our surprise you slept looking cherubic.
That morning thoughtfully, I dispensed with
DR Spock and other self help books, I think.
As I realised that night, you were unique
Divine guidance I will have to seek.
You rejected all canned baby food
And threw tantrums, had mercurial moods.
Unpredictable, assertive even as a child
Felt at loss whether to be strict or mild.
Early on, I had to my dismay found
Life was not going to be a merry go round
I hoped with time, you would mellow down,
Hopeless, I would feel drained by Sun down.
Thus the years… not exactly flew.
And before, I knew
You brought home a guy
Grinning broadly saying Hi.
We didn’t snigger, just kept quiet
No point to reason, resist or fight.
Looking us in the eye, you said trust my instincts,
Folks just hurry and send cards for print.
Born rebel, we just had no choice but to accept
Angry, I thought she belong in a home for delinquents.
And to maintain peace at all costs
We blessed the couple and raised a toast.
For once she proved to be right
The guy turned out to be quite bright.
Now she has a one year old baby
Who like little Denise drives her crazy.
One day on a visit, she quizzed
Mom, how did you put up with me?
Darling, we mothers survive,
Just enjoy and let her thrive.
She asked, her eyes filled with a plea
i hope you didn't ask God to punish me?
where did you get this idea, my dear
i know i know, i troubled you for years.
