i looked into my daughters eyes
love and affection i could not hide.
while explaining to her what life meant to me
the tears started to roll very freely.
choked up with emotion that i could not stop
i told her what i struggled for and what i got.
the two most beautiful women in my life
my brown eyed daughter and my wife.
this is what part of life means to me
having my child and my family.
although at times i may not seem to care
for my thoughts may be elsewhere.
my ears may be deaf, and my mind far away
but my love is here to stay.
so when i hear GODS beckoning call
let it be said to one and all.
my indian spirit is with me, 'i will not fall'.
my body may die, but not my soul
for that is something that can't be put in a hole.
my body may die, but not my mind
for that will live throughout all time.
so my daughter, don't you despair
for i will always be right here.
and when you're feeling down and out
think of today and what we talked about.
let your thoughts run free and clear
and you'll feel my presence near.
' from one heart touching another.'
