Having a new friend in our
land,
To her, we extend our hand.
My family, is waiting, to see
you there
To place a flower, in your
hair..
Your house, number one, in
the row,
Surrounded by lots of mistletoe.
Decorated with candy kisses,
For a special little misses.
You'll meet Snow White,
Tinker Bell too,
They'll come out, and play,
with you.
You can join our fairy clan
Play in our family band.
Dance around our fairy ring,
Enjoy yourself, laugh and
sing.
Yarrow, will help you too,
Make sure your dreams
come true.
So welcome to our fairy
land,
Little Princess, from far
away land..
TO
SWEET DAUGHTER OF AFZAL SHAUQ
