A tattered coolie who was born in a leap year that comes home after a strenuous day's work?
He loves his coquetry daughter.
Her mother has disappeared when she was an infant.
He thinks that he has to make a cordon to protect her from the ruffian the apothecary's son.
His wife eloped through this rickety fence and he is scared of his precious daughter's future.
He dreams one day his daughter goes right of the passage with rituals.
But who knows and how long this skeleton survives with his sing-song?
