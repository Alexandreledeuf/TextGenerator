my sunshine,
came to me
on a day that it poured with rain,
a little bundle so beautiful, so defenseless,
that it took my breath away,
dark grey blue eyes, that looked at me and,
wisely seemed to say,
i am here now, yours alone,
life will never be the same.
little hands that clutched my finger,
and wrenched my heart away
defiant mouth, and pink shell like lips,
always knew what to say,
through difficult times and trials,
my sunshine has spread her light,
been a little friend to me,
loved me day and night,
she sailed through life bravely and well,
God 's child she surely must be,
if ever I love someone too much
no doubt its only she
