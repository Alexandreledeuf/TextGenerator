School,
Some things you like, Some you hate.
School,
Wake up at six, But you're still always late.
School,
Not talking about college when you can pick your classes,
School,
I'm sick of hearing, 'Where the heck are your glasses? ! '
School,
Homework takes up the rest of your time,
School,
I want to be a kid, I don't care whose face's on the dime.
School,
To force me to go, It's a felony, A CRIME!
