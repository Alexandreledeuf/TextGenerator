I remember my first days at school
How the building seemed so big
I remember where I hung my coat
By the picture of a pig
I remember our headmistress
Her face was sprouting hair
I remember I was always told
Not to look it’s rude to stare
I remember all the screaming
From the children how they cried
I remember double swinging doors
That seemed so very wide
I remember in the sandpit
Pouring water-making slush
I remember teacher telling us
Let’s have a little hush
I remember cold school dinners
How the dinner ladies shout
I remember most of all I think
When they told us school was out
