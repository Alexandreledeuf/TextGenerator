Those school days, when I was a student
Remembering my days with my wonderful teachers
Teaching lessons for us was not difficult for them
But learning lessons from them was a tough task of our life
They taught us the best and we gained the best
Our mistakes were dealt with understandings
Our mischievous were forgiven and directed us to right path
But the discipline was maintained well from top to bottom
They behaved as teachers and also dear friends
They accepted our respect but also our love to them
They imparted knowledge which was rich in quality
Not only they took care of our studies but also our future career
We knew someday we have to say goodbye
to them with broken heart
But we always remember those fond memories spent with them
Let me thank God for giving us wonderful teachers
during our school days
