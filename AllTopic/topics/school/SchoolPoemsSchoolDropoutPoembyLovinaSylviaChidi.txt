He never went to school
But he was no fool
He was simply playing Mr Cool
Eyes closed by cottonwool
Cheered on my mates
Sealed his present faith
There is a time to play
A time to go to school
His parents told him
Make that your number one rule
He wholly ignored them
How can education
be a such golden gem
Now he sobs, sobs, sobs
Now he robs, robs, robs
No qualifications
Zero education
His mates have moved on
to better jobs
In many glorious nations
Now he sobs, sobs, sobs
Now he robs, robs, robs
He wishes he was a student
He wishes he had the talent
He had at one moment
There are no more screams and shouts
Because he knows what he is all about
He is a school dropout
