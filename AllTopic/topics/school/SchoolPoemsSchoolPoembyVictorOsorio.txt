Before, Vick became my name
Before, Sad thoughts set in
Before, Girls started to say no
Before, Entering the party world
Before, The PS2 craze
Before, Bible girl
Before, Long work days
Before, The blizzard of 2000
Before, DVD's made my list
Before, My other friend
Before, People started to diss
Before, Poetry was at my best
Before, Cell phones rang
Before, Life became a test
Before, My loser gang
Before, Memories I started to miss
Before, Days became lonely
Before all this
You knew me from school.
