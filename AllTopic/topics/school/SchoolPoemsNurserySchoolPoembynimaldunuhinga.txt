I was caught by the principal,
'Hey! What are you doing here?
Don't you know this is a center for children
Usually under five years of age
And you are a matured person? '
I replied humbly ' I am sorry Madam, still I am a little tea pot short & stout and pour me little wisdom to become a sprout.'
