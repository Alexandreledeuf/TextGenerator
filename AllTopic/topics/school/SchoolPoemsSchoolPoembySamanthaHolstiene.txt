School is fun,
School is great,
Even if your late.
In school we do Math,
We do Art,
I love that part.
In Social Studies,
We have homework buddies.
PE is the best,
Compared to all the rest.
During lunch,
We will munch,
And then drink grape punch.
Then we play,
For thirty minutes of the day
