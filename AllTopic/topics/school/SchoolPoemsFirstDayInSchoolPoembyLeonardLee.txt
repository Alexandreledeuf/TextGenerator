I am as invisible as the wind...
no one knows me but they know i'm around...
they don't talk to me, they'd rather look at the ground...
soo i'm the outcast of the class...
some look through me as though i'm made of glass...
But i like it this way..
i don't know why but it sort of made my day...
i sit alone all the time...
to me i think they are all slime...
Snobbery in my part i guess...
or maybe i'm just in a lonely mess...
whatever it is, i should start talking...
simply because assignments are coming...
But who would talk to a weirdo like me?
looks like i have to put on my mask for them to see...
