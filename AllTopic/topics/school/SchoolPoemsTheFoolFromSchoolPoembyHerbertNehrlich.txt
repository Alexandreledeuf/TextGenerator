It  now is time.
I'll have to tell the world.
And never did I ever
mean to do this.
Regardless of,
what peers today
require,
I will come out.
The girl I love is
no one you would know.
She is the sweetest,
loveliest of all.
She walks around
as if the world could
well ignore her.
I am afraid,
I tell you with
reluctance,
that someone bigger,
better, smarter comes along.
And takes her on his horse
to distant fields,
she would forget
her home,
and me the
fool from school.
What do you think?
She loves me and
I love her.
Would all this count enough
to seal
our pact forever?
