theres a name thats lost
Maybe someone I never met
Everyone knows them
Maybe they just forget
Theres our old home
You call it high school
I was the popular reject
Maybe a make believe fool
Theres that book
The one I never read
maybe I could've been smarter
If I really used my head
Theres a broken mirror
I recognize that face
It's the kid known as Vick
He never forgets this place
Theres the blue locker
It still looks the same
I open the door
I still see my name.
