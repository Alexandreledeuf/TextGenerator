Why do we go to school?
We have to learn
We have to strive harder
We have to go to school
School can be fun...
For some people!
I find it fun
I find it bad
I know a guy who was whipped at his school...
That was my dad!) :
So be lucky with have fair schools now
And not green liver for lunch
Like my mum had!) :
Honestly!
Be cool and calm
Or you'll find yourself...
In the headmasters palm...
