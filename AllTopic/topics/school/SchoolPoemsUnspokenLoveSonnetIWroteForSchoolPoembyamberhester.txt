If only you knew how much i love you
if only you cared that i was alive
but theres no way you would care if you knew
because you don't feel near the same as i
for you my love will never be shown
because you won't like me for i am sure
mt heart thirst for my love for you be shown
but broken will it be for ever more
if only you knew my love so deep
my heart wouldnt ache for your love
i wouldn't have to cry myself to sleep
if only i could get help from above
if only you knew how much i cared
you might love me back but i am too scared
