in school,
when  i  saw  you
i  intuited  i  have  found
my  lost  world  in  you
i  wish  i  could  act
to  be  appreciated
by  you  in  school.
in school,
it  would  be too sad
to  narrate  the  ordeal
i  have  been  through
i  wonder  if  its  best
i  had  met you
in  the  school.
in  school,
though  i  had  not  said  it
there  has  been  so  many  ways
that  i have  shown  it
my  actions  had  done
whatever  i  wanted  to  say
at  school.
in  school,
i  never  thought
being  in  love
could  take  me  to  madness
well,  it  is  better  than
leaving  me  in  sadness
in  the  school.
in  school,
when i  approached  you
i  knew  i  was  silly
it  was  because
suddenly,
i  forgot  who  i  was
in  school
in  school,
why  do  you  sneer
when  i  am  near
it  really  breaks  me
just  tell  me  what  to  do
to  get  a  room  from  you
in and  out  of  school.
in school,
sometimes  though  it  is  hard
i  guess  i  must  let  go
some  things  i wish  to  have
though  good  things  also
could  be  found  elsewhere
as  it  has  been  in  school.
