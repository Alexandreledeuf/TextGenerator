When you were born it was an instant love affair
I rocked you, swaddled you, sang to you,
Read to you and walked you round and round
We played and learned together.
I held your little hands from your first steps
To the back of the bicycle seat on your first ride
Doctored up scraped knees and bruised egos
Played the Tooth fairy, Easter Bunny and Santa Claus
When life took you through a challenge
I held you in my arms as you cried
We wiped the tears and stood up tall
Ready to face the world again
Late one night when I was awakened by the sounds
Of giggles coming from the adjacent room
I could've be upset that you had woken me
But the sound of your laughter made me smile
You were so late coming home one night
I cried at the thought of something happening to you
I was so angry that you hadn’t called
But upon seeing your beautiful face, all I could be was grateful
Now you’re ready to spread your wings
All of our trials and tribulations are ancient history
Go now my love into the world
Make your mark and shine your light
You have been the source of my greatest joy
From your baby coos to your big girl shoes
Always remember who you are
You have always been my brightest star
