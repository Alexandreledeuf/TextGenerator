Seeds expelled to wander the desert air
Finding refuge in burial soil of a promised land.
An opened petal soon dies;
Come spring the bulb revives.
A vine clinging to her motherâ€™s dress,
Her fists budded into her mother-haven,
Crying tears of distress,
Running waters streaking her cheeks.
Unparted waters to the promised land,
Unbinding the clasping hands,
To walk through the parted sea,
Tears of baptism, tears of rebirth,
running waters streaking her cheeks.
For those who know and understand
The truth will make them free;
But how to see and understand
That beyond the fear we will be free.
