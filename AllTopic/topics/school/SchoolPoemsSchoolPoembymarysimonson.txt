waking up for school,
getting to school going to school,
I used to think school was
Just for fools and friends...
But if you look at it now
It aint just for that
It helps you...and when I
say help I mean helps you
reach your goals...
And for the one's that dropped
out...bad idea
Cause now you don't have an
education...so come on all
you dropp outs go back to
school and make something
better of yourself.
'DON'T BE DUMB STAY IN SCHOOL'
