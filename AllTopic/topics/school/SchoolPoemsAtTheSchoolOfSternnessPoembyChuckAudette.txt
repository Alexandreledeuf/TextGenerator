at the School of Sternness
there's a class on 'How to Frown'
Ms. Leech doesn't like me
and called me the class clown
when we did the lesson
on '20 Different Sneers'
I descended into trouble
for laughing down the stares
oh yes, I guess - I could wrinkle my brow
with the best of them
but my eyes would twinkle, somehow
while I sang the funeral hymn
Mr. Jenks says now my glower power
is no longer up to par
he's perplexed, 'cuz my aptitude tests
showed that I could go far
'You could have been director
of a top-notch funeral home
or a Principal scowling angrily
as through the halls you roam! '
But at my poor grades, I just have to laugh
for my heart my bearing mirrors
who cares if I got another F
for too many glaring errors?
after my course on Stern Disapproval
I was whistling in the hall
Mr. Ick demanded my instant removal
and the whole school was appalled
They dragged me to the Dean
who growled 'what's this I'm hearing of? ! '
so I finally just came clean
and told the Dean “I’m in love! ”
