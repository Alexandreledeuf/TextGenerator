I am a young school boy,
With a white shirt and black tie,
I dream to fly high,
Like a falcon in the sky,
Not bothered how, what and why?
We are a gang of five,
I  and my friends do try,
To read and play all the while,
I am a young school boy,
We have a sports teacher,
Who is a like bully bear,
His tantrums I don’t care,
I will  follow our class teacher;
We have a teacher in science
We pray for his absence,
As we all are tense,
During his class of no nonsense;
We have a moral teacher,
Who is nothing less than a preacher,
He is always in sparkling white,
His lectures are also upright;
Sir George is teaching us history,
He is always in a mystery,
About the Hitler’s victory,
He is the best among the faculty,
We have a teacher in English,
She hates us being childish,
She always behaves bullish,
When home work we don’t finish;
We promise, not to touch smack,
Nor  we change our dream track,
As it makes mind to crack,
I am a smart young school boy;
Mummy daddy behind my back,
To finish daily home work pack,
Before I change the track,
And run up to hit the sack,
I am a smart young school boy;
