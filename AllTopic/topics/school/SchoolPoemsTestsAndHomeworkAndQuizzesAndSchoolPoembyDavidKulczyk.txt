You know that if there was one thing,
That you could take from school,
It wouldn't be art or math or history,
It would be work.
Those ugly things you want to blow up,
and smash,
and burn,
and crinkle,
and rip,
and tear,
and throw out.
Those things that make you have to remember,
all the stuff you learned before,
and to study, study, study,
'till your eyes fall out.
“Oh, sorry I wasn't paying attention”
and
'Did we learn this? '
never helps when the test monster gives you the paper, And wishes you well.
But you know she doesn't mean that.
She doesn't want us to do good,
she just wants us to hurry so she can give us another test.
And then it's June!
Good that the year's almost over,
But bad 'cause........
FINAL EXAMS
Oh no! ! !
The mother of all tests,
And what did you say? We have to take more than one!
I'm done for.
Your sitting there,
hand clenched on the pencil,
face sweating,
and then BINGO!
You get the answer.
You jump up and scream,
in the silent classroom.
You shout out with joy 'cause they’re all over.
No more exams, or quizzes, or tests, or homework.
You bring up you paper and sit back down.
Then it happens.
Excuse me please come up to the front of the room
Right then and there
DETENTION!
No it’s not detention?
Whoo Hoo! ! ! !
It’s homework
Well that’s just as bad.
You think,  No. No. You didn't just say there's still homework? ?
And we have to do it everyday of the summer! !
You have to be kidding me.
“Oh, just strike me down right here and save me from homework! ! “
But wait,
You say it's fun homework,
BLAH,
homework can't be fun,
or joyous,
or exciting,
or awesome,
or amusing,
or entertaining,
JUST HORRIBLE! ! !
“So we have to do fun homework? ? “
“What is it? “
It is to have fun?
And stay safe? ?
“No, you must be kidding.”
Your not kidding! Really! ! Cool! !
Well see you next year!
If I can stop having fun and come back!
GOOD BYE SCHOOL AND TESTS! ! !
