O the pressures of school
It is so heavy I feel like a mule
Slave everyday
I do not want to stay
O the pressures of school
The teachers know everything
And we know nothing
Choosing is not a choice
We are taught to be successful from people who are not
Just wish to be and wish us to be
But they know most of us will fail
Because we will bail
And live in jail
So we can tell our tale
Of how badly we wanted to prevail
But the pressures of school were too great
I don’t think they remember what its like to be in high school
Don’t they remember the pressures from their teachers to be better?
From there students to do drugs and smoke?
To choose to do shit that makes pressures go away but bring some different pressures?
At least we have a choice to do that shit
I think that’s where kids get caught
Choice, freedom, rebel…
Sweet sounds for a teenager worth the price
We hold the dice when it comes to these decisions
Finally we can control something
We are our own bosses
Yes we may loose
But lucky seven
Will take us to heaven
It is not easy finishing school
We are also just starting our complicated lives
Yes we need some guidance
But we don’t need to be on a choke hold
We don’t want to do what we’re told
We have pressures from society
From our family
From the academy
Hell we even have pressures from the TV!
Yet they still don’t see the large burden they put on our shoulders
They think, ‘what can some more pressure do?
Besides this pressure is good for you.’
All I want to do is write poetry
It is my drug
So I don’t have the pressures of taking drugs
It is my addiction
So I don’t need any smokes
It is in my family
So I don’t need pressures from my family
It is even my TV
So I don’t need a TV
So I can tell myself how I am supposed to look and how I am supposed to live my life
It is all I want from school
I know my English and I know how I feel
So I don’t need the pressures of school
All you need to be a poet
Is to turn your feelings into words
You don’t have to be successful
As long as it feeds you’re own pressures rather than the pressures of society
Yet O the pressures of school are so great
I cannot escape
Until their pressures are obliterate
