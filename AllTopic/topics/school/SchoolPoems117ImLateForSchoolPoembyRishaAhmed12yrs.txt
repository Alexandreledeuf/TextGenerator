Oh no I’m late for school
The alarm woke me up late in the morn
Oh how could this happen?
I’m sure I had set the alarm right, I could have sworn
I was supposed to wake up at seven
But now its nearly eight
If I’m not on time my teacher will kill me
Or else she will use me for fishing as bait
In a total hustle bustle I tried to pack my bag
Oh now where is my math book gone?
And then I also realized I
Had left my pencil box in the lawn
Mom tried to stop me but I was too busy
To hear what she had to say
Without breakfast I ran to bus stop
Whilst the sun on me, cast its many a bright ray
I stood there waiting for my bus
Which always came at eight
But it didn’t arrive at all
Uh oh, was I too late?
At last I gave up hope
And came home to rest for the day
When my eyes fell on the calendar
And I realized today is a Sunday.
