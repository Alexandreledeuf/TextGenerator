I found an old country Cowboy Valentine
that was made so very long ago.
It was signed at the bottom in crayon
by a young boy who's name was, Buffalo Joe.
You could tell it was all hand made
some of the glitter and bangles have fallen off.
Colored with bright colors so neatly
Better than any in a store, one could have bought.
Tried to picture the face that made it
tried as hard as I could ever do.
But for as hard as I had tried to remember
I couldn't grasp that vision of you.
Those were the days of less worries
and a childs heart now just memories.
'Will Ya be My Valentines Partner? '
In that Valentines card you made for me.
