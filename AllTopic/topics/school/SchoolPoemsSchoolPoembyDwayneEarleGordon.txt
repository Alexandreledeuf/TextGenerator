School, it is stressing at times.
Many times I don't even have it on my mind.
School is good, and it is bad, there are times I think that I'm
going to mad.
It is a good thing to go to school, so that you could remember the rules.
Don't be shy.
Don't be a fool.
Go to school, and learn all the rules.
