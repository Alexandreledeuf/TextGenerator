You go to school
everyday
just to be told
you can't do it that way
you have to do it my way
it is in the rules
and you think
school isn't cool
teachers think they're all that
and that they can control us
but sometimes I wish my teachers
would get hit by a bus
I know that sounds mean
but I haven't even said
that school everyday
I always dread
It feels like a prison
with no escape
why oh why
am I bound to this fate?
Of course we have to go to school
we have to all week
but couldn't school be more fun
instead of really starting to reek!
But we have to go through it
all 12 grades
and we have to go to college
what a bad day!
The days drag on
they never end
until the bells rings
and I run as fast as I can
It's almost christmas break
and I can't wait
because more days at school
I just can't take.
School sucks
and I think it is bad
and even though we are tortured
it isn't all bad
I guess what i'm trying to say is
school can sometimes be good
and you learn stuff
and that's is sorta good
so school is boring
and is not really fun
but we will get through it
and then for joy we will jump
