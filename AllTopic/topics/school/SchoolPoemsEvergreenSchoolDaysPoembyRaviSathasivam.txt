Our evergreen school days
will not come back again
From the nursery to high school
we learnt the best
and the best that taught by our teachers
Our school life was full of cheers
and lived with full of mischievous
but the discipline was maintained well
We sang and danced without
thinking of our future.
We spent money without earned them
When the school start after the vacation
we meet our friends happily and
welcomed new friends dearly
We played all the games and we won
many games with out care of sun or rain
Many years have been gone
today we live different parts of the world
but the memories of our school days
will live in our hearts as ever green days.
