It’s  been  twelve  years  in  this  school
And  memories  reign  in  my  heart.
It’s  now  that  I  feel  you,  miss  you,
When  we  are  all  about  to  part.
'Old  order  changeth  yielding
Forth  to  new',  he  said.
To  my  dear  IX  Std. do  something  better,
Better  than  what  we  had.
To  sing  of  you  my  friends  and  teachers,
Of  the  relationship  we  share,
Words  will  merely  describe  them,
Thoughts  of  love  and  care.
To  you  my  teachers  I  express  thanks,
Your  teachings  were  not  mere  words.
They  beautified  and  strengthened  me
And  helped  me  lead  these  sheep  in herds.
And  to  you  my  friends,  my  dearest  friends,
I  wanna  say  nothing.
It’s  only  by  words  of  love  and  silence,
That  I  speak  to  you  and  you  to  me.
And  I  must  thank  all  my  peons
Who  worked  behind  the  scene.
They  swept  my  class  and  dirtied  themselves,
And  yet  remained  unseen.
We  are  leaving  you  my  teachers
And  you  will  go  on  teaching,
And  when you’ll  not  be  there,
Through  us your  lives  will  go  on  existing.
By  and  by  this  life  will  go  on
And  I’ll  cherish  these  moments  shared  with  you.
But  I  don’t  want  these  moments  at  all,
For  in  my  life,  friends!  I  want  you.
Many  new  flowers  will  bloom  in  life
And  many  more  stars  will  shine.
But  without  you  my  dearest  ones
It’ll  be  hard  to  make  those  stars  and  flowers  all mine.
To  live  to  the  expectations  of  you,  my  teachers,
And  friends  your  wishes,  I’ll  try.
Though  amidst  the  chaos  of  my  life
In  silence  my  heart  will  cry.
Thank  you  my  teachers  and  good luck  my  friends
As  we  all  bid  each  other  a  farewell.
I  hope  in  these  twelve  years  of  mine
I  have  fared  well.
