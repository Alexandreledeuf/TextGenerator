Where are you, boys and girls
of Miss Lindahl's 5th grade class?
What became of you
when you slipped off
the far edge of my world?
Many of you
I never saw again,
or even thought of
until I saw this picture,
yet you occupy a place
that can't be filled
by anyone but you —
so much yourselves,
untrained as yet
in putting on a face.
Your faces are colors
long forgotten,
your names sound notes
of a long-lost scale:
Harvey Baer, Gail Rutherford,
Marion Phipps, Jonathon Katz,
Temmy Goldwasser, Randy Wahl —
your names are bells that angels ring,
tolling the music of the spheres.
