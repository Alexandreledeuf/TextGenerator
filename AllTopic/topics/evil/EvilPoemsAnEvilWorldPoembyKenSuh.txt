The world is made of many places
with different people, many races
With love and hope, joy and laughter
from morning light, to darkness after
But our world has another face
a whole other people, land, and race
It’s not always what you think
somehow those two worlds link
In a alley comes a man, eyes in anger…rage
in fury of heart he takes a knife…stabs
Freeing the evil from it’s cage
…..This is Murder
Comes a woman with a man...unwisely they’re alone
the women trust him with some pleasure…but
The consequences have been sown
…..This is Lust
Two good friends have a party….one amazing…one a dope
the dope is angry that his friend is dazing
He imagines death on a rope
…..This is Hate
A child lying, crying, dying…while his mother is beaten
hit and smashed, pushed and thrashed…while the child whimpers
His love, joy, faith is eaten
…..This is Fear
People dying, stealing, lying, no matter where they be
Pain, hate, fear everywhere, anywhere to see
A sinful world it will stay, till God, one day, returns
Destruction, death, evil…..is all the earth learns
…..This is our World…our Evil World
