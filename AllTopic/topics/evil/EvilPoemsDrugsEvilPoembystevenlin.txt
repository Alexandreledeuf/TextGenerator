Rises in the east,
sets in the west
cheers by friends,
denounces by the law
once who taste it,
never got rid of thee
try for my heart,
why it's so hard.
no songs that i could sing,
and they are came up with real things
drugs' like crap
never bring positive feedback
desire for a fabulous life,
but who has stolen my wife
tic tac,
tic tac
we shall go,
but where do we go?
