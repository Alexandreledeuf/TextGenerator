Hello my name is Hate and I was born in the beginning
I'm in a competition with Love but I seem to be winning
It's an autobiography so I guess I'll tell about some of my succession
Well, I was the reason the world went through the Great depression
I traveled into the mind of the whites so they'd hate black
You know what I caused them to make em slaves as a matter of fact
I had to fight Love too, so segregation wouldn't stop
Even though I lost I made sure the whites are still on top
I dug into the mind of Cain provoking him to kill Abel
I even stopped Freedom from keeping America stable
I twisted the mind of Hitler to make blond seem great
I am the source of most pain, my name is Hate
I built Attila the Hun to be a dominant leader
I sent out deception to make his followers believers
I traveled into Pharaoh's heart so that he opposed Moses
But God stepped in but in foiling God's plans I'm still the closest
Me and Osama had a chat about how he'd bomb the towers
For a deal I kept him hiding so now he's still in power
I showed Judas Iscariot his prominence after killing The messiah
I even taught people to mimic Jesus Isiah Solomon and Jeremiah
I brought Columbus to America so it seems he made it
I asked Lie to help me so for the truth he could shade it
I gave the African American community Disease, Guns, and Drugs
So they could be looked at lower than some ripped and ragged  Rugs
I am backed up by my leader Evil so now I'm great
I am the darkness in your lives I am the Malicious Hate
