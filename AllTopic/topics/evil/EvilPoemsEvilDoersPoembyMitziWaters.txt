Evil doers will tear love down,
spin love round and round,
like a whirlwind.
But hold onto the love,
if one knows it to be true.
Do not listen to the lies,
deception, or untruths.
And yet, there is some consolation,
there is some purpose to life.
There is the lovely destiny,
that's waiting on the other side.
It's full of love and truth,
shining brightly as a star.
But the only way to find it,
is to follow the strength,
and beauty of the heart.
