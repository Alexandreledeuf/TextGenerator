your hands of evil,
your touches of sin,
only i,
know where you've been,
touch me again,
and i will knock you down,
and you will lay there,
till by god your found...
You screwed up my life,
the minute your hand touched my leg,
i asked you to stop,
i practicalley begged,
but it wasn't enough,
you just wanted more,
so you grabbed me tight,
and threw me on the floor...
Are you glad for what you did?
are you proud of what you've done?
Do you know that what you've done,
now cannot be undone?
so burn in hell,
cos that's where you belong,
for your hands of evil,
are absolutely WRONG! ! ! ! !
