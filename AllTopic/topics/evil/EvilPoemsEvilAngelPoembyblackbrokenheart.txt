There’s a beautiful angel
Sent from above
But she’s an evil angel
The heavens call her love.
This beautiful angel
She falls from the sky
Looking for someone to torture
On the wings of a butterfly
This angel seems to find you
Where you may go
She lands on your shoulder
And love she does show
This angel is evil
She gives you love then takes it away
Leaving your heart always empty
For her love is never here to stay
This angel has hurt me
Many times before
So I’m closing my heart completely
It will not be broken no more.
