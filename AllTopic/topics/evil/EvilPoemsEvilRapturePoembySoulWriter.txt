Cant believe she did that
The bitch turned into a rat
Had her under my roof, protected her for 3 years
And all i have to show 4 it are empty tears
And a court case
Thats how the do it in my race
All i wanted to do was teach
All she did in the end was leech
Money...
Tme...
My good nature...
She turned into a evil Rapture
Praying on my good heart
Did a good job of tearing it apart
But im a Soulja
And i don't hide and run 4 cover
Especially not from the Rapture and her witch of a mother
I'm preparing to draw my sword
And take the head off the Rapture
That will be the kodak moment will capture
It will be slow and she will endure much pain
I yern 2 c blood drawn from her vains
And i the end when im asked
'what caused this destruction to begin....? '
My response
'It wasn't me... twas the beast within....'
And how is this destruction going to stop?
When i witness the last blood drop.....
