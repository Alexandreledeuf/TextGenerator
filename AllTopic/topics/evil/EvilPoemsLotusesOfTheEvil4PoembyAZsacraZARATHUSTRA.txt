snow is melting
in the bill
of the eagle
all of a sudden
gushed out
the dew!
peal
of the bluebell
under the hail
grandeur
of imperceptible
death
when is the muteness
the silence is
the thunder!
the tear of Christ
betrays
the bit of tear
abandoned nestlings
are being nursed by
death
fallen leaves
are for the dead
wind
the warmth of baby rats
is in the killed
rat
even if
the dropp of
dark!
to break the cage
inside the flying
hawk!
withered
tree flowers
with the flam
the triumph
of the sliding
of the tear
Dao
of seduction
of the chaos
the leap of tiger
from the tip of
the speck of dust
to save inside
in order to Execute
outside!
the killed
by roses is himself
the killer of the roses
the kill â€“
is the Most
tender!
the butterfly
has broken the dropp of
tear!
satori
in the state of
ash
