When the love was great,
The pain is even greater than your mate
When the love was inseparable,
The longing will be utterly unbearable
When the love was all you ever had,
The hole and emptiness will be enough to make you mad
When the love was sacred, pure
The pain will be enough to endure
Love is evil it's true i see
I lock away my heart with a key
