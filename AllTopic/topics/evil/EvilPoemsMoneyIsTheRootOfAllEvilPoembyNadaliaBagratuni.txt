Don't listen to a word they say,
Money can't really be that way,
To say money is evil surely can't be true,
Isn't it something that we all love to use,
To think that money is evil would you have to agree
That the thing that prints it would as evil as can be!
Wouldn't that mean that the Government
Is the root of all this evil merriment,
Simply because they print all of it!
