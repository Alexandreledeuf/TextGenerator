how do you keep a soul pure
untainted
untouched
how do you keep ones innocence
when they are born into a home of evil
the truth is you can’t
for you learn from those around you
even when you don’t want to
you do
so how is this fair
he was never given a fighting chance
for we are born with a heart of gold
but it is but to those around you
to let you keep it
for if you live with people with tainted hearts
yours to will slowly become tainted
unless you fight
but being born into it
you can not fight at such an age
you have to trust that someone will fight for you
