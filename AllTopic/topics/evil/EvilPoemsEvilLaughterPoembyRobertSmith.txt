On thing I admire, nay two things
always strike me as admirable:
The way evil characters always
laugh with total happy abandon
About their plots to overthrow the
world, and the way they always
love their cats, mostly white with
blue eyes – given the importance
Of joyous laughter in our lives,
people having pets living longer,
healthy lives - this phenomenon
is deserving of attention
I am thinking of a scheme to overthrow
the world so I can throw back my head
to laugh long and hard and happily,
Hollywood has this down pat
By making villains keep taped laughter
in a box – preferably on a wheel-chair’s
side  – as villains are mostly sitting there,
having lost a limb or two
They turn it on for special effect upon
pronouncing their next evil event – luckily
my cell-phone announces incoming messages
with a bout of hysterical laughter
I always irritate my wife by laughing along; the
cat I already have, an evil creature, trying to
scratch me whenever I pass - I’m sure to
enjoy all the advantages of evil
Laughter; keeping an arch-villain cat as the
basis of the evil plot that is my life!
