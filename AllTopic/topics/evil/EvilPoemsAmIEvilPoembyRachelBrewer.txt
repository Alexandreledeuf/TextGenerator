Am I evil,
For having these thoughts in my head.?
Am I evil,
For thinking things of dread?
Am I evil,
For not believing what you do?
Am I evil,
For ripping people in two?
Am I evil,
For simply speaking my mind?
Am I evil,
For leaving you behind?
Am I evil,
For trying to do things right?
Am I  evil,
For giving you a fright?
Am I evil,
For leaving you alone in life?
Am I evil,
For not wanting to be your wife?
Am I evil,
For doing the things I do?
Am I evil,
Hang on, why am I asking you?
