Crackle, pop, the wood that fuels the fire snaps
It falls to the bottom of the pit
Where I can again hear the coals sizzle
With my desire
My feet start to move
Then my legs
Oh man there my hand goes
Just wishing you were here
I bite my lip till it bleeds
In silence I scream out in pleasure
As I touch the point of ignition
The fire extends through out my whole body
And echoâ€™s into my soul
I cant help myself
This feeling
This need
This desire
I want so badly
My addition
It grows as long as the fire grows
And the fire will grow as long as
My addition needs feeding
