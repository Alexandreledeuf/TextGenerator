If you look for evil good you cannot see
For your eyes only tell you what they want you in others to see
Of good and bad races you keep telling me
But your opinions are different to mine we see things differently.
I've worked with those of different races and backgrounds and in truth I can say
That people as a whole are quite good in their own way
Of different beliefs and cultures but I found them to be okay
If you show respect for others respect to you they will pay.
When you start comparing races you I do not wish to hear
your ignorance on such matters only based on your fear
Of those you see as different to you difference you cannot embrace
'Tis wrong to condemn people because of their race.
If you are only looking for flaws in those who are different to you then flaws you will find
To the good that is in them you do become blind
In this multicultural World your thinking renders you as small
One must admire those who believe in a fair go for all.
