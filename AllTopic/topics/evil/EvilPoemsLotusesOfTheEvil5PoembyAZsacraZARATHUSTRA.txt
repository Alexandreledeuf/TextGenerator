death of the lotus
in the pose of
cobra
trembling
of the broken
webs
the beaming of the blood
on hair of
the wolf
narcissus
is full of
sap
has reminded of hara-kiri
protruded from the belly
the sword of locust
“Hara-kiri”
of the every particle of
light
the snow that
lies is falling
quicker
the clap
of fluffy eyelids of
the eagle-owl
the  snowflake
gives birth to
power!
Death –
is the most
fragile!
surprise
of butterfly among
the snowflakes
there is only the snow
in the abandoned
nest
tremble of hairs
on the belly of
the bumble-bee
it is the New
kind of shiver – without
fear!
the sudden
speed of
the wind
the appiness of the
sudden
death!
all of a sudden there is a lightning
there is all of a sudden
the thunder
the lighting has not
discerned
the dragonfly
the chasm couldn't
grip
the void
wasn't in time to sleep
the autumn
bumble-bee
the butterfly
is late for
its death
