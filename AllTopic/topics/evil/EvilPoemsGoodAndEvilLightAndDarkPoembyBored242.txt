There will be a time.
When good is defeated.
When lights vanish from time
When the sun does not rise to greet the next day
There will be only night
in night there is only darkness
And in darkness there is only evil
There will be a day
When evil dies
When the stars fade away
When the is no moon to light the way
And on this day there will be nothing but mist
In a world without good and evil
There is no reason
There is nothing
But people in the streets trying to find their way home through the mist hiding their way
