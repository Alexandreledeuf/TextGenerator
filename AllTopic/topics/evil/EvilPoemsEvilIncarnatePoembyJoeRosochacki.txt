Joshua Royce Mauldin, Abbadon,
Angra Mainyu, Satan,
Asmodai, Beelzebub,
Lucifer, Belial, and Iblis all rolled into one.
Why is the guy still alive?
After physically beaten up a baby girl,
Sticking her in a refrigerator then in a microwave,
Where she had nothing but tendon and bone,
All her skin, muscle, and fat were cooked,
Why is this guy still alive?
We know what happens when stick a cup of water for a couple minutes on high,
Scalding water is what you get.
The microwaves create friction in between the molecules and thus heat is present.
Our bodies are more than 75% water,
he literally cooked her.
Why is this guy alive?
He gets 25 years if he does the maximum,
he’ll be out when he is 45 years old.
I can predict he’ll never see 25 because the inmates will take where justice left off.
Why is this guy alive?
- so he can be tortured before he is put to death by a fellow inmate.
But the legal wheels are spinning, do you want a bad joke?
Read the following if you will,
The girl's mother, Eva Mauldin, refused defense attorneys' requests to testify and lives in Arkansas. A trial to terminate the Mauldins' parental rights is scheduled for April.
