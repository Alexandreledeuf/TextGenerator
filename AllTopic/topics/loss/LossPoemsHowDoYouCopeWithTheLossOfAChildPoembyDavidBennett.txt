'HOW DO YOU COPE'
How do you cope with the loss of a child?
One minute their here, the next their gone.
The child you brought up with so much care,
Suddenly they are no longer here.
No smile or a touch how do you cope?
I just cant imagine when you have lost hope,
Its just not right, not the order of things!
To lose your child is an awful thing.
Whether they are young, or, older it should not be.
Your child should be here sat on your knee.
Not the other way round when they have gone!
All your Aspirations down the pan.
God bless anybody who has felt this pain.
You need each other to get through the rain.
Though its not right, for you to feel this pain!
When you pass through you will be together again.
