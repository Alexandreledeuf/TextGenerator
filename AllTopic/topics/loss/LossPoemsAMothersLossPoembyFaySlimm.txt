To live with a loss so great
After time of month-long waiting
Would invite such natural rage,
That a child, a babe of no age
Who was wanted and loved so much
Could die, and would leave me in so much
Pain,  if Heaven's love did not make
Plain  to me that my dear child faces
A place of tender peace, and clutching
Him tightly is Eternal Life, touchingly
Singing his lullaby needs. All praise
Be if my human heart views these ways
As right. Then I can cope, wait to see
Him again, sure he has not ceased to be.
