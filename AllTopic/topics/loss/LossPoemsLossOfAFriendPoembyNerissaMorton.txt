A loss of a friend hurts
The loss of a best friend hurts more,
But it is never a true loss;
Everyday you will see something that reminds you of them
This will bring a memory;
A memory of the times you speant together
Followed by another;
A memory of how you went your seperate ways
They will always be in your mind;
They never really leave you.
