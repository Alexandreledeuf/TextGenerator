without your family life would be cold
without your family the tears will flow
the more you think the more you know
how you need your family
in order to grow
but what seems to me
what seems to be
my family is the cause of
all my misery
i take it all in
but let none out
the world is so cold so so cold
yes i try i try so hard
but the more i try the more i cry
because i can never reach your
level for me
it's just to much to much to handle
but without my family
i would be cold
so i have to deal
with the one i own
