I wonder if you think of me at all,
I am and it’s not helping me any more.
I need someone to take me away,
Take me away to a place where there is no memory or pain
I hope this someone is you
but still I can not hope much
I only hope that my heart can last
I haven’t seen you for a while
And everyone thinks I’m doing fine…
It’s not that simple,
I hope it was
Falling in love it’s just a loss,
A loss of soul in a strange way
When nothing seems the same it’s so easy to go insane.
Pointless dreams and silly thoughts,
Stupid smiles even when I see your name written wrong,
I wonder if you dedicate me even a second of your thoughts…
