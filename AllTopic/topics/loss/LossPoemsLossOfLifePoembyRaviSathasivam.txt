When the faith is lost in the heaven
Then the peace will become an enemy in our soul
When the love is lost in our heart
Then the nature of behavior become full of sins
When the knowledge is lost in the school
Then the nation's future will suffer from wisdom
When the kindness is lost in the nation
Then the people of the nation become immoral
When a home is lost its brightness of life
Then the family will suffer from mantle agony
When the nature is lost its beauty
Then the pleasant green pastures become like a dessert land
When all those prayers are kept away from God
Then the tears of life can not be cured
