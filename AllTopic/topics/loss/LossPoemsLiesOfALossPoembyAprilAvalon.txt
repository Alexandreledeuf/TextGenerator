Going away,
I take one last look behind,
And you can't believe those winter days
Were nothing more than lies.
Knives in our backs,
Dying memories inside -
Maybe I've become so heartless,
Maybe free, or simply blind.
Dear, we are done,
Drink your tears of regret,
Find the answers by yourself,
And make my side of our bed.
Swallow your last words,
Go on living in your shell.
In front of you is loneliness -
I've only cast my spell.
Wounds will heal so soon,
But for years you'll be scarred.
You could never think you'd say this,
But you'll find our parting hard.
Shards of perished hope
Watch your recent dreams come by,
You'll feel lost and devastated,
You will hear this song and cry!
Everything that's left
Burns your blood and slits your wrists,
It's your silent suicide,
But I can feel no guilt for this.
No guilt for this!
