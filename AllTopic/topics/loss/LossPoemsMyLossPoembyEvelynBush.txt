Let me not cry with your passing away.
For in my heart, you'll always
Be here to stay.
It's for my loss and
Loneliness, that I weep.
For I know that you have
Peaceful sleep.
While I, who remain behind,
Am hurt and lonely at the love and
Friendship, that I have lost.
Yet in my heart, you
Will always be
A comforting memory.
