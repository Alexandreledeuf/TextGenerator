I don't quite remember
When it was, or maybe
Where it was...
Or even WHO I was
At the time,
Much less whom I was with...
But I do know
I woke up,
A different person...
Than the one
I was
When I went to sleep..
However,
I wasn't alone
When I awoke...
Nor was I alone
The night before,
And I can only wonder...
Who took my wonder,
And maybe my innocence,
Away from me?
