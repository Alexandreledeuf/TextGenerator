When I was young, I saw happy ever after in your eyes.
The stars reflected in your auburn hair, and new horizons
sprang eternal every morning with sunlit skies.
Such dreams danced in my every heartbeat, and new joy,
joy leapt immortal each night with palpable visions
of you my love.
But, when you died, sadness ever after filled my tears.
My hair turned gray beneath the dim moonâ€™s light, and death,
death cast its shadow upon every morn and turned my joys to fears.
Such misery flailing with my every thought, and old wounds,
wounds gaped in sorrow's fields with the finiteness of my breath
as I wept for the loss of you.
