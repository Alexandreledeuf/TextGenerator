I am so lost, alone, and misguided...
Where are the people I clung to?
I wish today was yesterday,
And so it seems the more days I live,
The more I want to go back to tomorrow and be happy.
Is this the prison I'm confined to,
Hating today and constantly dreaming of the past?
Am I to be miserable for the rest of my time here?
Or will I take a chance...
Will I do it again?
Go out on a limb,
Find someone to hold to,
Someone to embrace and tell everything to,
Someone I would trust and love?
What will I do, what choice should I make?
Life is so short and yet so complicated...
Why can't I just be happy?
Why can't I just be loved?
Why is life so hurtful?
Why do am I still putting up with it?
Because I believe that there is love,
Says one part of my mind to me.
No matter what you'll find someone one,
The one you're meant to be with.
No, I say, you're mad, insane!
You'll never find someone that will understand!
Stop trying to be more than you are,
You pathetic filth, you'll die alone!
So what'll it be?
What will you do?
Take a chance and find love again,
Or sulk in regrets of thing in the past?
What to do, what to do,
With your life ahead of you?
Birth and Death,
Two words but so much more in between...
