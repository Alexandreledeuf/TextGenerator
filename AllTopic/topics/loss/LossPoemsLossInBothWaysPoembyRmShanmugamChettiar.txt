When I had vigour
I had no valour;
When I gathered valour
I had lost my vigour.
End is zero.
When I was eager
The means were meager;
When I grew richer
I had lost to be eager.
End is cipher.
When I was pretty
I was shy;
When I outgrew shyness
I had shed my beauty.
End is at naught.
When there was youth
No means to adorn with;
When there were means
Where is my youth?
End is the nil.
