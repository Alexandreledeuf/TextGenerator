Forgive me if I say the demise of your father
Brought me back to my writing once again.
But it’s also true- I had stopped writing rather
Since silence between us, grew like a mound within.
Now, I have no words of consolation to shower
Can only feel and share your pain with shiver
We know, a precious gift is lost in life forever
It was to happen one day or the other but for sure.
Though I could suffer the silence of till date
The muteness of today is unbearably a fate
I want to talk to you but still I hold it and wait
For the reason, that it’s time, you want to be quiet.
I cannot bring ‘Solace’, though I wished I could
I cannot stop tears rolling down because it should.
I only wish a monsoon on you, to hide your tear
So you cry to your hearts content, without fear.
Take this grief into your stride with plain fact
River get dried or joins the sea to reach the bliss
Flow has to stop, as the boundary is already set
Else humans will never know the value of ‘Loss’
