The pain of loss is just too much
you will no longer be here to touch
gone forever is so true
but I will always remember you
the thought is too hard to bare
I shall not cry, I do not dare
the thought of you is still here
but I will shed not a tear
for I know where you will be
further than the eye can see
with our Father in the Heaven above
I will see you soon my love.
