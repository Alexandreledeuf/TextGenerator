I was lost 6 months ago
It was lust that drove my soul
I couldn't controll...
what happened that night
What a loss I say to you
It wasn't love
but why not try something new?
Why judge someone you don't know?
Just open your mind and go with the flow
But no...
You had left so many words unspoken
I have questions, but your mind still isn't open
What a loss I say to you
