In the depths of the night,
As they stumble–in darkness,
They know not what is right;
Who has been here the longest?
Like a sigh–lost in a crowd,
Or the Last star in the sky,
Death is constant–absorbed
Into the ramblings of life.
In the midst of the darkness,
They aimlessly wander.
In searching–In pleading,
To find what is lost.
This sigh fades away
In the crowds growing murmur.
This star fades away
In Sol’s waking smile.
They grieve and they worry,
Looking for the light.
Instead they find wisdom,
and this wisdom is sight.
