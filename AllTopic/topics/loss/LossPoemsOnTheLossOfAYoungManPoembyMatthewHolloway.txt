On the loss of a young man
~
A young man
With a steady career
Promising future
Highly rated
Close circle of friends
A young family
Well provided for
The kind of life
Many wish to have
All too suddenly gone
Leaving repeated questions
None will ever understand
Those silent tears
He wept and kept alone
Till they became to much
An obituary in a newspaper
Reads praise from many
The ending of his story
Sad and sadly unknown
Another young man
Gone too soon
