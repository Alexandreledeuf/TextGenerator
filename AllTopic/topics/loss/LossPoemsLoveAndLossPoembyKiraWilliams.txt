I told him i loved him,
what a stupid mistake on my part.
He actually made me feel like a real person,
Now all i feel like is an empty shell.
When we were actually together,
you seemed to understand how much i needed you,
how much i actually cared.
Now however,
I dont think i can look at you
without feeling all the feelings i used to feel.
I hate that i dont think i'll ever be able to forget you
but i love that you were part of my life.
Ilove you forever and always
