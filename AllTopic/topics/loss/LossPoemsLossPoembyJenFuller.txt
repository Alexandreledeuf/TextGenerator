I never knew when you arrived,
Had no clue when you left.
How long were you with me,
If you were with me at all?
Were you imagined by my fevered brain
Because all signs pointed to yes?
I thought you were my miracle,
My chance to do something right.
Yet you were taken from me
Before you could see the light.
I feel like a punishment
Has been doled out to me.
Have my sins been too great?
Have I lived too selfishly?
It doesn't seem fair
That I will never get the chance to know you.
You were unexpected and unplanned
Yet I fell in love with you.
I would have given you the life you deserved
If only we had made it through.
