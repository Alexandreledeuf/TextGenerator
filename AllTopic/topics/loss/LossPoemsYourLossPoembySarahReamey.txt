Im sitting here looking at this old flower,
It's been about a half an hour.
Seeing you, No longer makes me blue.
I now see how the time has flew.
I no longer have to pretend that everything is fine.
Because it was your loss, not mine.
When you see me I hope that you feel blue;
And realize how good I was to you.
Everything now is perfectly fine.
Because it's your loss and never was mine.
