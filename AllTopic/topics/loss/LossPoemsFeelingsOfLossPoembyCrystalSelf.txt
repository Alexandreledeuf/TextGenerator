Instantly life flashes through my mind,
It is raining, but there's not a cloud in the sky.
Succumbed by emotion,
Reality grabs my nervous system,
Like a vampire's thrusting canines,
Everything that was common is somehow misplaced,
Hiding in a dark room,
Extracting all the love inside me,
Like a needle to the vein,
As I surrender to the devastion,
My heart explodes with envy,
For the life that is now only in my dreams,
Dazed as I go through the daily routines of life,
Surreal as it all seems,
This is my reality,
With not a tear left to cry,
I sit in solitude,
Waiting,
Waiting,
Will I be able to collect all the tiny pieces of my broken heart?
Will I be able to find happiness again?
This I ponder from within the hole in which I lay,
Waiting,
Waiting,
Seeking justification,
My mouth implodes with the jargon of my remorse,
Seek comfort, I will, in the solace of my own redemption
Lay to rest the history of me becoming totally undone.
