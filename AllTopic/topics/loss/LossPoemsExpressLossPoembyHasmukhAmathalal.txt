How can you grieve and express loss?
Do you cry loud think or choose?
Stay in corner and get lost in memory
Stay with gloomy face under deep worry
God needs them most in His Courtroom
Where as there was no dearth for others with room
Person may be precious like fine star in the sky
Shined for few hours and immediately chosen to fly
We feel world as hollow
We think sun may not shine tomorrow
Nights may be all worthless
We may have lot many problems to chase
Such might have been the dominant position
The loss caused to family is sudden imposition
Family may take some time to adjust the shock
They have yet to come out of it to take the stock
Even though we are aware of uncertainty
We leave it to good wisdom of almighty
It is natural to shed a tear over loss
We follow the natural and consider it as divine cause
Think of no control on life span
Human beings might have made lots of plans
Nobody would have preferred quitting of their own
So almighty has taken control in hand and made it known
We attribute untimely death as decided by destiny
Some of us may not reconcile or come to terms fully
Yet the helplessness is openly seen on the face
Life has been termed as adventurous but as uncertain race
So always we talk of great wisdom
Raise hands in disgust cry foul seldom
Somewhere we realize its futility
Suddenly come down to terms as inability
