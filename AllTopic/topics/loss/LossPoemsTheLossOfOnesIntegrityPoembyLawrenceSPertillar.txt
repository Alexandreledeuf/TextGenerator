They are calling their deliberate, derogatory antics,
Meltdowns.
I refer to them,
As exposed realities of repackaged nuts!
What comes through one's lips,
Often flows from a premeditated mind...
From where disgusting outlooks sit!
No matter how impressive,
One's appearance gets!
They are calling their deliberate, derogatory antics,
Meltdowns.
I refer to them,
As exposed realities of repackaged nuts!
Speaking with a 'learned' intelligence,
Does not make one identified with common sense.
The evidence is there.
Whether videotaped...
Or later excused in one's defense.
On or off televised 'air'!
Ignorance unleashed,
Even crosses picket fences...
Where lawns are manicured.
And the loss of one's integrity,
Can be extremely expensive for one senseless and dense.
Showing one who may have wealth...
To have concern for nothing else but self!
Several down!
Many more to go!
