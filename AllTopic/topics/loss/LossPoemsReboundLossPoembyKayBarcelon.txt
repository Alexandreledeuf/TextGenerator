I woke up one morning
Finding love in a strange place
He was in a jam with a broken wing
Lifeless and pallid I cannot see his face
He needs a second chance only I could give
I reached out to him to give him a hand
Hesitated he wouldnâ€™t even give me one look
Standing off at a distance with nothing planned
I explored and observed every corner and nook
Surprise I gave him a smile that shaken his world
I danced until his heart starts to beat
We became friends and love begins
But the broken wing is difficult to heal
The pain is holding him back from living
And in his cruel world my sincerity thins
Proving my self is a worthless challenge
I will be a rebound girl forever second
In his eyes he sees only the first
His true love the name will never change
Our story never will be celebrated in verse
