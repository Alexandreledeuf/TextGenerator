I remember the rain
Drenching from the blinds
Making sound of silence, dripping outside...
I remember the road of struggle
And the thorns embracing our feet
Saying songs of vengeance...revenge...revenge...
I remember the armors, the hearts of no mercy
The hands of swords...the masks of enemies
remember the weeping wives from their soldierâ€™s men
Leaving home for wars...leaving families for peace
I remember the cloudy skies
Where everyone waits the rain
Wash their bloody faces and soul
quenches their spirits wounded thirst
I remember the roofs where stars seen above
Where moon shines dimly shy
To hungry sleepless creatures below..
I remember a story that has a beginning...has an end
It has traces and marks
Of unwanted truths of faith
The legend sometimes destroyed
From the hands of creator
but will they sleep for decades
Century?
Or millennium?
