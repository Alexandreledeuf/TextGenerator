Losing a poem is like losing a life
A poem that seems set to make history
then itself now becoming history
by a saddened mystery
that emulates it's attribute 'mystery'
A dear poem just evaporates
into air so thin for recovery
that I wonder how else to retrieve
the beautiful artwork of description
that flowed down my fingers
as I penned down my insights
I have lost this to foolishness
as I copied not a draft
to fall on, on the occasion of a loss
I tried really hard to reborn
the thoughts that had a part to play
in the mix of the words displayed
on the screen of this new innovation [computer]
that led to the loss of my words
all for a trust I cannot convict
for stealing my precious thoughts
embedded in the lines of that poem
The feeling that you are gone is bitter
but I guess I should be capable
of rising to it's occassion
that are chanting in my mind
with rhetorical questions
seeming so difficult
to place a finger on
My dear,
I have decided to pay for your loss
and I admit that you are gone
but I'd make sure you remain green
in the hard disk of my being.
Dedicated to 'The Joy I See',
A poem i wrote on the computer but disappeared as i thought it was saved on my poems list.
ADIEU! ! !
