Death leaves heartache no one can heal, grief fresh, adjusting to losing a friend. In time memories bring humor and I'll laugh again and it will dissipate the pain. Things I don't want to happen but must learn to accept, adjust and believe happen for a reason. Remain in faith and prayer for friends and family I can't live with out but have to let go...those I have lost & My children that I am away from, I am missing you everyday.
