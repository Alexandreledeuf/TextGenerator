In our world, you are still here in spirit, to guide us, help us and do what you do best, make us laugh when times get hard.
You are now the wind beneath our wings,
The air in which we breathe,
The water in which we need,
Gone but never to be forgotten,
Reaching up for the stars, I can still feel your hand, reaching down and guiding me which way to go,
Looking at the footprints in the sand, the two sets of feet…and when times get hard.. I will know that when there is only one set of footprints…I know that you will be carrying me,
At this time, In our hearts… We are in sorrow for our loss but we know that if you could still be heard in which the way we hear things…
You would tell everyone to stop and stare around us, that we have the most powerful thing that anyone could ever have and that is life itself.
