I remember speaking to you,
Once upon some months ago.
Once upon a fairy tale;
Once upon the fairest day.
Niceness could be compared to none,
And the first of all could be spent.
As I glanced in your gray direction,
I wished I could know you better,
And I wish I would have visited,
And I wish I could reverse everything;
But the future has spoken,
And you were swept away from me.
I wish I would have known you better,
And I wish I would have visited,
But the virus grew inside of you,
And you were swept away from me.
I would have it other ways.
I would have myself infected for you.
Your virus I would spread for you,
Upon my body, my hopes, my dreams.
Your niceness could be compared to none,
And God, I wish I had visited you.
We spoke like sweet rivers,
Radiant in the sun and forever flowing;
Until the virus grew inside of you,
And you were swept away from me
And now live in my dreams,
For you will never be forgotten, My Uncle.
