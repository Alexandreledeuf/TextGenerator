I saw her face in a painting
High cheekbones thin nose full lips
I see her now as she's fainting-struggling- wandering
Long black hair and  full hips
Loss!
It screams out at me and the memories flood
Loss!
It screams out at me and it draws my blood
Loss!
A summers day as I spy on my first beloved for the last time
I was merely 7
Loss  of Susan
Knowing for the first time that a loved one was gone
To a mystical place known as heaven
Loss of Grandma
Screaming and flooding my memory as i see the girl in the painting
I as i remember and I'm fainting
The school day when they told us our chum had died
I sighed just sighed as the schoolgirls cried
A shoe thrown under a moving car
He didn't see very far
My mom's face as she witnessed told me it all
The boy would never again play ball
Loss of Billy
There i am in the 9th grade
staring into a pair of adorable eyes
I didn't need to learn of Leukemia that way
Never saw her not smiling from ear to ear
Every single moment happy to be here
And damn she was smart
Why did god take back that heart?
Loss of Sara
I saw her face in a painting
Now i see her wandering-struggling-fainting
Why did i see her face in a painting?
There i was and there he went
The president of 50 men
Here today and gone again
Rugged, reliable, responsible, tall and then
Gone.  How his brother must've cried
Loss of Jim
Then the Rose told the tale
My college roommate who would not fail
To take his life as he had planned
Long before he met me he was damned
The sleepwalking through days and days and days
The inability to peer through the misty haze
Loss of Frank
You lose someone you love and you understand these days
When i talk about the misty haze
Loss
I saw her face in a  painting long before i ever met her
High cheekbones, thin classical nose
Full lips, full hips,
Now she's struggling- wandering- fainting
Unable to peer through the misty haze
Unable to answer my gaze
Loss of her brother
Loss
It all makes sense now
God  thank you
You kept me here to try to give her cheer
I will try i will try I will try
I owe u God that is why
You showed me her face in a painting
The painting now etched in my memory which i shall call
Loss
