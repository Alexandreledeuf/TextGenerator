Indeed we live in troubled times
Our days filled with angst n’ worry
Good folk committing petty crimes
Blindly going nowhere in a hurry
Some complain of “Memory loss”
Whilst caught up in hurtful foment
Their days lived in utter chaos
Forsaken; “Living in the moment”
When events speed up slow down!
Deliberate; then proceed
‘Lest you quickly sink n’ drown
For it’s your loss when lifetime tallied
Life is best when you’re the boss,
And there’s no need for memory loss
