the loss of a loved one is hard to face
but you know they're in a better place
a place where there is no suffering and no pain
a place where loved ones are all the same.
a place where the angels gather to sing
with every new person that they bring.
for in this kingdom of happiness and joy
and pain does not exist.
sits our god and his beloved son.
he gave up his life so that we could see
what it is to be set free.
of all the suffering that we must go through
just so he could be with you.
so raise your head and look to the sky
for your loved one will be flying high.
their wings will be a beautiful white
and nothing can compare to that beautiful sight.
so put away your tears and grief
and thank the lord up above for his everlasting love.
