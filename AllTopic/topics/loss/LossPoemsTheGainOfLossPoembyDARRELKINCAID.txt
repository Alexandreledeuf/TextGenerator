Hardest of Lifes lessons is loss,
In which having becomes without,
When complete changes to shatters,
That what was full is, just an emptiness,
And guided becomes lost.
Security of knowing, fades to a memory,
Images of Love, become dreams,
Security of touch, a sensation ebbed away,
And Loneliness becomes company.
When the weakened Heart, strengthens,
tired from the weariness, of loss,
Growing, of the last Love,
To become the strength,
Of the next.
Lesson learned, is not to Love less,
With Loss,
lesson is, to learn to Love Grander,
With Gain.
