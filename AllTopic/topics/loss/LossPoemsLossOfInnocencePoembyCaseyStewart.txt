Curiosity grows, finding new ground
Temptation breaks all resistance
Dark discoveries flood in
Innocence swept away
Sinfull satisfaction sweeps over
Curiosity laughs, temptation has won
Sources change, sin remains
Innocence is dead, replaced
Solemn days, no surprises
The sun shines over cold flesh
A warm heart beats, needing joy
Content for now, a mind wanders
Innocence has been lost...
