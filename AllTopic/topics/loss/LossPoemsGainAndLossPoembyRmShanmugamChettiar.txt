I bought an idol made of ivory.
All said it was good; it got its glory.
Who must I be grateful to:
The seller, the maker,
The smuggler, the very tusk
Or the elephant slaughtered?
Is such gain worthy?
I lost the idol made of ivory.
A treasure was it; I got fury.
Who must I blame for the loss:
The inmates, the servants,
The thief, his need and creed
Or the society that valued it?
Is such loss a pity?
Credits and blames on tracing
Would fizzle out to naught.
