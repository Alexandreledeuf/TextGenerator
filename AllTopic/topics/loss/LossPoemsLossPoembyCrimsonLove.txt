Loss is something one deals with in their own way,
I've lost so much, its all but gone,
Out of it all..... I miss my mind the most.
Not able to think, not able to remeber anything,
Besides what was left in my heart,
all the loss.......all the pain, can't be forgotten,
The heart remebers all,
Every word thats hurt you,
every person that has Betrayed you......
all remebered within the scars left on your heart,
Lost in an ending, always hoping to restart.
