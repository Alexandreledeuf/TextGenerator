Each one has an important part
They guided us all the way
Each one has a place in my heart
For being there each day
Good role models to everyone
You never stopped believing
When we're sorry for what we've done
They are always so forgiving
When there's something we can't understand
They never stopped trying
Always ready to lend a hand
To help keep us from falling
Thank you teachers, you're always there
Every time I needed a friend
I enjoy the moments we share
I hope our moments would never end
Dear teachers, so sweet and kind
Look how fast the time has fly
Teachers like you I shall never find
But I will never say goodbye
