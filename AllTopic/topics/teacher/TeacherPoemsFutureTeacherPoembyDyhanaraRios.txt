(1st place winner of Texas Career Association Poetry Contest 2010)
When I am done with school,
I am turning right back around
To teach and inspire others,
Just like my teachers have inspired me.
I will love each and every student:
I’ll listen to their problems,
Give them praise for the good they’ve done,
Congratulate them for awards they’ve won,
And have faith in each and every one.
I’ll be the teacher everyone loves:
Who smiles to everyone
And passes out hugs,
And encourage all my students
To excel above and beyond.
I’ll still be a student myself,
Learning lessons about life
With every day that passes by.
