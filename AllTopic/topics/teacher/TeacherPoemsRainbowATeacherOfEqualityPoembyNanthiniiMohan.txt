It is the colour of seven threaded in one;
As that of a free silk gown, before the eyes of poor!
It is a greeting to earth through clouds;
With its curved eyebrow!
It is the art and tact of nature;
Where it can't be learnt by any other means!
It is the anchor to give us the happiness;
That can be dissolved neither in air nor in water!
It is adorned in the sky to show us;
The path of nature and its divine silence!
It is the jewel made up of haze;
To welcome the guest- rainfall!
It is a boon, given to us;
For the long penance of our eyes!
It is the wonder, pointed out in a single finger;
Whenever we peep above the sky!
It is the garland from heaven's holy fairies;
To destroy the disparity among men!
It is a glorious gift from nature;
For it appears the same to everyone!
