She has blond hair,
Her smile is pink.
She comes from America,
I come  from China.
She has blue eyes,
I have black.
She eats suger cane on Christmas,
I prefer Jiaozi at Spring Festival.
She is my English teaher,
I am her lovely student.
I heard that she would read the Bible everyday.
I noticed that when December is coming around,
She will be wearing the Christmas clothes all the time,
I felt that she is old enough to tell me the secret of life.
She looks so young and energetic,
She looks so amazing.
On Chistmas Day,
She wearing the earrings of gold christmas tree,
Told me,
'You can enjoy the big merriment of this day! '
God will give you anything you like,
If you believe in him.
Learn to be a choice for God.
