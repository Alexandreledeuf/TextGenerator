The Teacher Is The Teacher's Teacher:

Some drown in hydrolyzed clouds
Some fall with the rains' wiping away
All progress made let fade into top soils
Wet bloody mud from trampling up the
King's vaunted highway to that
End where order of tables care
For regeneration in my Grandson's blood
All school seats taken are seats of despair
That I am here and you are there despite
The rules of passion and the roads
Of unenlightened homes where fair made
Immunities out of the comfort of our beds
My boy classified as one of the
Little People - an adorable youth
Observer at the recesses
His light is an observable new Advanced
Placement reflection on the theater of
Our roles on the stages of the comedies
Portrayed in crowded rooms full of
Achievers and audience participants
Some swim the firmament's waters
To the ending catholical marathons.
