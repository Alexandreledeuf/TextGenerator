A teacher will guide you in many ways,
Displaying patience and inspiring hope,
A knowledgeable person with a spirited soul,
Preparing you to be in a position to always cope,
An untiring ability that is always exhibited,
The crown of intelligence adorning the head,
A special and charming person everyday,
Teaching you to tackle problems just ahead.
A devoted teacher that you will always respect,
That prepared you to select a future career,
To think of your posterity in a positive way,
And to glorify in the sunshine without any fear.
