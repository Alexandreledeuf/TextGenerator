Thirteen years older
but hardly wiser
I return to my past
to find you
six months dead.
Still alive in this head
is memory of you
and our infamous
three days and nights
sustaining on
sunflowerseeds
and moonshine.
as we pissed the
hours & days
away
till I gave up
and went home
alone
to the biggest
hangovers ever.
You died
an alcoholic at
fourtyfive, and I
wonder at the
caurse of your
excessive
indifferent
recklessness.
Did someone
break your heart,
or did you just
loose faith in life
or yourself?
We toasted to
Night & Day
Black & White
Life & Death
Us & Them
This ones to
You.
