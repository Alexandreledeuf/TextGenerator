This is the first poem I have written.
----------------
If I become a teacher I will
Respect the children's every emotion,
I will teach in such a way,
That learning will be fun.
Everyone in the class will be
Encouraged at every bend,
In my class unfair things
Will definitely come to an end.
In my class I will
Conduct interesting experiments.
The children will always remember
Those happily spent moments.
No one in my class,
Will be beaten or scolded,
Every one will be
Taught properly instead.
Every one will be allowed to
Express their feelings with ease.
Every child will be willing to help
Children bad at studies.
Children who dread studies
Will be shown its positive side.
Then from studies
They will not try to hide.
There will be no reason
For anyone to feel left out.
For I will give everyone equal importance
Of this there is no doubt.
The children's aim will be
To achieve excellence, not success.
For this will ultimately lead them
To the path of happiness.
