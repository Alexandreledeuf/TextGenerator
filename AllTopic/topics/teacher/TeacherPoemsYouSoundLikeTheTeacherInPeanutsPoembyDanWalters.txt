You want someone to hear you
Run your mouth
No one wants to listen to a pathological liar
You talk loud
Now my aggravations got the best of me
Drown you out
You tell your stories, I try to wrap my brain
I've lost count
I pick the best and write your fiction
What you're about
It makes for a laugh or something to fill a void
Shut your mouth
