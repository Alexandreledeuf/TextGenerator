The teacher must know
As Plato once
Well said it
Years ago,
A teacher is but a midwife
But the disciple
The student
Is still the one who
Gets himself
Impregnated with
Ideas
The teacher simply helps
In giving the birth
Of the ideas that
The student must himself
Conceive
When the ideas are born
The teacher cares for them
Newly born babies
Now having exciting lives
Of their own
The teacher watches them
Very well pleased,
Excited for something new
Greater than himself,
Rising above
Almost all else, then the teacher
Claps his hands & then
Happily dies,
His mission is accomplished.
