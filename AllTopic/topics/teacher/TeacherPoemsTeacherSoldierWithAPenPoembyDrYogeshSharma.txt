Teacher is a soldier with a pen and an eternal guide
Lighting wisdom to mind decayed and white,
Floating tirelessly till dark with no pride,
Without fear and favor telling tales bright.
To clean the dirt river flows and air floats,
To vibrate heart and mind he gloats.
â€˜Tween goddess Sarswati and man he is linking milk,
Giving life to the world with deepest think.
As blessed banyan with roots, side by side,
Withstand winter, storm, wind and tide,
Beauty he admires and goodness wide,
Word and language such as teacher ride,
He will turn dust to gold, if his ways not hide,
And rake a soul with favorite manifold glide.
