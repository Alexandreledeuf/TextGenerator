What would life be
Without colours?
“I have no clue
What they look like”
Said Pushkar.
I have been
Blind
Since I was three.
His calm face
And confident pace
Showed his total
Acceptance.
He had an acute sense
And sometimes
While reading
To him
He would interrupt me
And say
‘Today you are not wearing a smile”
He could sense
My restlessness
Once in a while
At times
He too lost his composure
Naked with his emotions
Depressed about his future
And looked for solace
In his teacher.
Now he is a grown man
With a family of his own
And takes pride
That he can see
The world through their eyes.
He doesn’t believe
I learnt so much
Watching him evolve:
Hope, endurance,
Perseverance.
