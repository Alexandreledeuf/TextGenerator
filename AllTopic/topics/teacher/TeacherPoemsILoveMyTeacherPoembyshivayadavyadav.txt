One fine morning i went my school
To meet my teachers and friends
Saw what i never had seen in their
Totaly changed atmosphere!
A chapel was built in the ground
Additional constructions were in that.
Never think it could turned like this
I have re-collecting the olden days
Whare i saw my teacher Helda in the chapel
She prays not for her but for the dears
She is the lady of honour not only in the age
With her good heart too...
