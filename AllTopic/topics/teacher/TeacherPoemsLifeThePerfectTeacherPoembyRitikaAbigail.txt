Life, the perfect teacher,
has a lot for us to offer,
right from the time we first open our eye,
to when we close them to say 'goodbye',
adding wisdom with each experience,
we grow in ourselves the ambience,
we learn how to differ right from wrong,
and hence with each day grow strong,
we may certainly at times fall,
but life teaches us to stand tall,
we have many desires and dreams,
life teaches us to be agleam,
there may be times of sorrow,
but life shows us a better tomorrow,
at times we may give up,
life teaches us to again get up,
at times we may fail,
life teaches us how to avail,
Life, the perfect teacher,
teaches us what we are ! !
