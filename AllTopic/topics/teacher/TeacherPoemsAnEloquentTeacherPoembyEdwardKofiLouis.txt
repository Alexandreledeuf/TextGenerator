Of one's responsibilities and of one's properties,
The day od clouds and thick darkness will meet us all;
But, copulation brings about the fertilization of the eggs.
To quicken your pace in this 'rat-race'!
With nods and grunts;
And like the legends of the Hidden City! !
But, you need to dicover your inner self as well on this love.
This thing called 'love' is eating you up!
And, you now need my romance to keep you going;
For, i am an eloquent teacher who wants to lead you on.
