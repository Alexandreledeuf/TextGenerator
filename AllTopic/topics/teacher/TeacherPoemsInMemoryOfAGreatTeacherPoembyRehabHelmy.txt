I know not of a man better than him
a man of morals and purity
my best teacher and example in life
I love him more than myself
he taught me how to be kind
and help the poor
I can't be a bad person,
when he is my teacher
I follow him in every single act
because he is the best teacher ever
never he lied and never rebuked anyone
he called for women and human rights,
thousand years ago.
I help the orphans and support charity,
because he is my best example.
he lightens my whole life
and I'm happy for having such a precious teacher
he is a timeless teacher,
a teacher of all ages
he is prophet Mohammed peace be upon him
