The final exams are in the offing
Mugging and bugging in full swing
Burning the midnight oil
Stumble to go to the next class
…………
Youthful faces with awe in the look
Start the year with cheering sigh
I know each by name calling day and day out
Half yearly closes breaking half my heart
Reaching the wards as everlasting partners
Achieved by bricking inch by inch
Portions are over and prelims are done with
Gems are ready though not for sale
Comes the day call it farewell
Loading tonnes of grief into my heart
Students nay my children start
Praising me for anything and everything
Tears start rolling down my cheeks
Not that praise inebriates me
Fear of separation and pangs of love
Prick  the heart with pin’s precision
Comes the vacation and birds fly off
Corrections to care, I go on with papers
Letters show me the person behind
Making me smile and cry
With pain in the heart and
Gain of centum result
I allow my children
To jump to the next class
Time rolls by with mixed feeling
Reach the school to the same class
New faces new hopes new feelings
Another set of children to make me happy and sad!
