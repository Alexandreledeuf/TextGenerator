Home is the first school and mother is the first teacher.
Parents are the builder of children's characters and minds.
The mother won't be a fighter but should be a well preacher.
If she is an illiterate she must carry her children to tuition.
Howsoever the mother should educate their children first.
And she should send her children to school daily and regularly.
Teachers are not blamed not to fulfil children's educational thirst.
Both the parents and teachers should make them the best citizens.
As we can't work with one hand likewise we can't walk with one leg.
Hence, parents and teachers are the same faces of the same coin.
If parents and teachers do them careless they suffer in life to beg.
Do well and have well it is said to see your own profit in life or ruin.
That is why parents and teachers are the best artists of the child.
If an art is spoilt the statue of the child looks like an ugly and a wild.
