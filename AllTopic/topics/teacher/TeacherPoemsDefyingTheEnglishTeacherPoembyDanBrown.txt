The best possible words,
with the best possible meaning,
in the best possible order,
with the best possible structure,
in the best possible way.
Thatâ€™s what I was once told poetry is.
But I pushed those boundaries,
and wrote in many different ways.
We should do poetry our own way,
no matter what anyone says.
