'That will teach you! '
He learnt how to
hit his wife
from his Dad
who hit his
and his Dad his.
And his mother hit him
glad this time not to be the victim.
Whether it be fist in face
knee in belly
or the bitter welt from a belt
violence sleeps quitely
and dreams
of the people it will
come alive in.
All down the years
it mutates from person to person
face to face
not paying attention
to gender or age
or who hits who or why
as long as there is someone
to cry
'....no...please! '
And there is no one to hear
you screaming.
