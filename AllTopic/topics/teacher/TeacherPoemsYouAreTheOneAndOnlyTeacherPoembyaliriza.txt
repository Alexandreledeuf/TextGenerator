i am taught well,
now my hands won't swell,
cause i have learned,
from you my dear teacher,
you entertained me,
and educated me,
all i want is your love and care,
without them i cant bear,
well, some people always thought that you were wrong,
cause they were no students but a gang,
you can tell what is best,
and you loves us to have funny fest,
could that be any better?
without my second parent?
i always loved you,
in return you taught me,
i thank you with all my might,
although i am afraid that you are going to be out of sight,
but your love and kindness,
will always be in my heart with thank fullness,
i just want to say,
Happy teachers' day! ,
for this is your day,
and you can do any thing today,
don't forget me miss,
and be always abliss,
you are the one and only teacher,
that i always loves FOREVER! ! ! !
