The Teacher isn’t a source of mere knowledge;
Neither is he a passive transmitter;
He frees the creative bird from the hedge,
And makes his students face their lives fitter.
The Teacher helps the student’s mind to grow,
In optimal a way, that’s possible;
The students needn’t the Teacher’s line just tow;
Curiosity that’s born is sensible.
His teaching methods must well suit young minds;
The doubts of students must be respected;
By introspection, every student finds
His strengths and weaknesses/ what’s expected?
Well, Teachers remove society’s evils,
Harnessing creativity of pupils.
