If I should meet you
on the dusty road of life
Do not despair
for I am your teacher
If you should stumble
while crossing my muddy path
Do not despair
for you are my teacher
If we should cry alone
and falter in hurricane winds
Do not despair
for they are our teachers
If our souls should meet again
with tattered and worn-out shoes
Do not despair
for we have not learned
