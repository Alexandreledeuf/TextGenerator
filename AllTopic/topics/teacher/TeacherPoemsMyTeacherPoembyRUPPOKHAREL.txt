Same smiling face of his
Same eyes falling on me
Of twenty years gone days
Panorama displayed before me.
I couldn't believe my eyes
Nor my mind could utter' Yes'
My teacher I found in one Daily
Under bold word 'Obituary'
Impounded within a square box.
I found my teacher seeing me
Teaching me.....
Advising me......
Narrating me the fallen fate
And being pasted.
Unnerved I was;
The Envelope carrying parcel gift
Bearing his address from within my bag
Pinched me...
For I was in the counter
Posting thro' courier
A souvenir for his deeds
For coining me of the day
Wishing Him 'Long-Live'
For the next Day was
The Day to remember- salute his stature;
The teacher's day...
The 5th.September.
