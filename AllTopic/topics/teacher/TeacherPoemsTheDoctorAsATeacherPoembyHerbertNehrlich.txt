From under light pink silken gown
arose, his silly face a grin
Rudolph the red-nose circus clown
and   asked about a nip of gin.
He had employed a French curette
to scrape the endometrium
it's where you really have to get
the slightest scrap out of the womb.
I know all you lascivious minds
it was a medical procedure
although he stayed, pulled down the blinds
as after all he was a teacher.
