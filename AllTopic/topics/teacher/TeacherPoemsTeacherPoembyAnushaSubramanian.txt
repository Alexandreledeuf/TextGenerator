With a caring mind and noble heart,
You teach us the life’s art.
Taking on a tough task,
You bring us on the life’s path.
Each day we see you,
We learn a new thing,
Which adds to our quality,
Like a little ding,
Inspired by your dignity, love and compassion.
Each time we come to you,  you act as a parent.
Each time we come to you,  you impart your talent.
You shape our personality, teach us the reality and
You build our confidence.
You took this path in your life,
To enlighten the path of ours,
Building up our life.
Teaching us attitudes,
And we pay with gratitude.
Without you we are not who we are,
Without you we are not what we are.
No words can express our thanks,
No gifts can express our gratitude,
Or the love that we have for you.
So, the least we can do is honor this day to every teacher to assure that,
You live in our hearts now and forever! !
Happy Teacher's Day!
