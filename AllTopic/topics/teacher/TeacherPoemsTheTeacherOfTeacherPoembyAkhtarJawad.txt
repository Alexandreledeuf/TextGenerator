The child is ahead of me,
he is jogging faster than me.
But why he is turning back and looking at me?
I love his half eyes on me.
Is like me he is also recollecting the past
when running faster than him
I had been ahead of him,
and I used to turn back my half eyes
looking at the child behind.
I am now waiting when the child learns
to be loving and kind
to the weaker.
I am sure soon he will be jogging like waves
besides decelerating his speed
and the grandfather will overtake his grandchild.
The teacher is confident this jogging will end in a caress.
He is my student bless him my God, bless!
Bless us with a golden moment
when the student becomes a teacher of his teacher!
