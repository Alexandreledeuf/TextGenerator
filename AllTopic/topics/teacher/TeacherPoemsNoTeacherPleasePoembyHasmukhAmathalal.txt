Teacher, teacher, teacher,
you don't be a preacher,
and never be a searcher,
I will become a researcher,
Madame always I mischief,
Still, you give relief,
Never you have punished,
If work not finished,
Class, always I miss,
Make I noise hiss,
I get up and ask miss,
Making nuisance for a piss,
You still not get angry,
Allow me to go if feel hungry,
I have a good rapport,
With your full support,
The whole day I play,
Mingle with dirt and also clay,
Still, I pass it as a good day,
No lessons are done and books at bay,
I will be clever and also naughty,
But never I trouble when feeling thirsty,
Learn the lessons by heart,
Make effort double to look smart,
I may not care and also respect,
Teacher and senior when they inspect,
Still, you never mention to my parents,
Never put remarkAnd also prevent,
Still, I not realize and continue to grow,
If a teacher isnot around whistle I blow,
Still, I find love and enough care,
Not good at study and not aware,
Should I fare badly never do a mail?
Papa and mummy may rush by rail,
They will take me home if I fail,
Put me in the room to serve in jail,
I make you a promise to be a good boy,
Learn and work hard and never make ploy,
My parents may get angry and not offer toy
So teacher please you not make them annoy
