As the sun shines so we make our hay,
Knowing that it is not here to stay,
And that soon it will fade away,
For as the dawn comes so will the day,
For patience and hope we pray,
That the light we follow will never stray,
Our trust and future i their hands we lay,
Waiting for their teachings and inspiration as a pay,
Like clay, in the hands of a potter,
Is like our lives in their hands they say,
And if we try to fool them at to play,
They will mould us into whatever they may,
And the path they will lead us might slay,
So we do as they say,
And follow the whole way.
