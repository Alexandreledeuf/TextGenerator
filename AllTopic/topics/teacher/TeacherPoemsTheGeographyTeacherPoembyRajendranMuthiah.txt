Never he showed the maps and globes to the boys.
His sudden entry scared them in the room.
Straddling his bike, he flew with a deafening noise.
To stop the smiles of the urchins, he'd loom.
He'd be going ratty if the boys said jokes.
To shun criticism, enough were his looks.
He'd stop teaching if a sore throat made croaks.
His wild punishment alarmed the young crooks.
Loud teaching he spurned as he was wont to read books.
