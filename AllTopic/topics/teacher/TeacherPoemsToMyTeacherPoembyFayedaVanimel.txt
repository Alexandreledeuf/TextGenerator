Oh my teacher...
let me praise you,
for you sprouted me out,
from a darkened life.
Oh my teacher...
show me -
your magical spirit..
by which you made-
the darkness to light.
oh my teacher...
let me thank you...
for which you, quenched my thirst-
for knowledge.
My teacher...,
thank you...
for you took out-
words from my throat-
and you showed me to-
make finest garland,
by those words...
My teacher...
you showed me,
the stars....
pointing up the sky..,
saying 'its stars...-
..shining stars...
..glittering..., twinkling...'
My teacher...
it's because of you,
i loved butterflies...,
and green grasshoppers..!
and it's because of you..
that i have,
dreams; unending.
My teacher..
i am always
indebted....for your deeds..
for the lifeline..
which you -
in my forehead!
My teacher....,
ne'er let your lamp-
to be gone into darkness.
My teacher...
this is for you...
dedicated with..,
sincere respect.
