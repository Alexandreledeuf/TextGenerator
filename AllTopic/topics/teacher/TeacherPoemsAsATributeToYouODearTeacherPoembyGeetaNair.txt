As a Tribute to you O dear Teacher
I wish to dedicate this poem.
You are an unselfish soul,
Who just knows only to give,
Introducer to the world of Alphabets,
Architect of Mind,
Cast of Character
Aspiration of Dreams,
As a Tribute to you…
………… dedicate this poem.
Hope of Tomorrow,
Lantern of Wisdom,
Source of Knowledge,
Creator of Literates,
Destroyer of the Ignorance
Mother of Dynamic Leaders.
