For some, you may be the candle
But for me, you are the light
That showed me how to handle
Even the daunting without fright
For some, your eyes may be warm
But for me, they are bright
They showed me the right platform
Leading me to a greater height
For some, you may be spring
But for me, you are the flowers
That groomed me little wings
To fly higher than the towers
For some, you may be a teacher
But for me, you are an angel
And angel whom I’ll never forget
But for now, it is ‘farewell’
(written for the best teacher that has ever taught me...my ex-class teacher...Reena Rajesh)
