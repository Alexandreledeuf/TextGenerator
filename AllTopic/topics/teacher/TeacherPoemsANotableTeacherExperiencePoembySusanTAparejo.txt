A new day to face many eyes,
Such inquisitive look  never lies,
The brain increases in sight,
Cracking almost to its size,
To address these minds,
To let them believe their not blinds,
To the wits I transfer in their kinds.
I lost my goal and find no more,
To reason is not a solution,
I found no trace to turn my track,
They carry me from the start,
Out  form the destiny I plot,
I struggle myself to stood still,
Clang my feet to where I stood.
A force to full me down seemed increased.
The glaring  sight of co- teachers move,
Commanding  them to pull me hard,
Shocked shaken me to the truth,
A snakes emerged even in the town,
Where concrete pathways ever exist.
The  more I wounded the more I was braver,
The scenario turned into a showdown,
A learner flashed a glaring knife,
My womb was the target of sharpness,
I closed my eyes to subdue to God,
Pray a little and asked salvation,
to Him I submit everything.
As the flying sharpness come near,
I saw the darkness overtook me,
I shouted unintimidating voice,
To melt the fire of burning desire,
Those co teachers dropped  their lids,
As the knife dropped,
So did their joy of seeing me free,
A lesson I ponder before
And I ponder more and more,
to water me into the field of
A good teacher to live forever.
