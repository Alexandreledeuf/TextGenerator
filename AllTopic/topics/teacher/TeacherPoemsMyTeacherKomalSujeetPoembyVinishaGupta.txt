I am back with Komal Sujeet,
I told you she is extremly sweet.
She made my life heaven,
She showed me rainbow colours all seven.
She is dazzingly beautiful,
Her eyes never look frightful.
I love her,
Because her hairs are like soft fur.
I told her 'I am fed up n want to die',
She told me'No, You have to fly'.
I see hre in all my dreams,
She always do something to stop my screams.
When I'll be the owner f KM compony,
I'll be the poorest even having so much money.
(I'll losse YOU!)
