Giving my ears a painful tweak
She called me nitwit, tittering freak
Your wishy-washy ideas are quite antique
Can't you follow what is in chic?
She yanked me close and then you REEK!
I tremored and give her smile weak
This was not all she had to speak
She was a champ in pointless critique
She had no control over her beak
I kept on listening because I was meek
And she knew not what I lost what I seek
