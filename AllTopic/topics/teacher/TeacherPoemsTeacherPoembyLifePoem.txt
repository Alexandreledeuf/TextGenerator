Teacher teacher, fairest of all,
Tell us what leaves will dropp in the fall?
Orange, yellow, red you say,
What new math will you give today?
Three squared times 2 and x + four,
Why is the principal at our door?
To collect our bills for the English trip,
How did bad emperors in Rome just FLIP?
They stole from the kingdom, teacher said.
From which side do children make their bed?
Right to left, and up then down.
Teachers says stop being a clown.
My teacher is fairest, fairest of all,
WAIT! What'd you say, I'm Tom and not Paul!
(Even teachers make mistakes.â˜» ;)
