Books are confusing
.Exams are tentioning.
But u are never bussy
To make it easy
U help me find my fire
Though i was big liar
Dared to disciplined us
Though we were abandoned
We use swear words on ur back.
Still u show lack of anger on ur face.
Sometime strict to make us fit.
Cuz u are the best teacher in world.
Ur lil' appreciating words
Are like torn apart from heaven
In a hand of gift teacher
A class room is a magical placd
There's smile on each child's facd
So heaven never call them back
Cuz my teacher is best in world
Justin bieber cody simpson
Taylor swift greyson chance
All in side when my teacher is in sight.
Hipocrates, socrates
All are senseless
Shakespear william wordsworth
All are wordless
Dawn of each poets and scientist
Begins with teacher.
Without my teacher
They are voiceless.
Cuz my teacher is best in the world.
Hey teacher i want to give
U round of applause
Cuz u got us fell in love
With the books
That were never in our looks.
U deserve a standing ovation
Cuz u 're the act of forgiveness and love. My best friend.
That's why i say my teacher is
The BEST IN WORLD.
Thank you!
