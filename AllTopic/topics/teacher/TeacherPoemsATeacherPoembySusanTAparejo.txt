Father, mother, sister rolled into one,
nanny, lover, helper and adviser,
caretaker, watchmaker, great planner,
an innovator, inventor, trainer,
to describe my teacher.
Life is no private,
they consumed them for public,
all eyes  in focus,
for an err of no cost.
So much fund never fun,
more work never won,
plenty of debt never a death,
many hearts, often hurts.
Good follower but no power,
better will, never wail,
clean thoughts often taught,
best choice is there in naught.
a mover to be moved,
a model to unmold,
a conversationalist  for the least,
a personality for all us-best!
