You know your true friend when you are in most need
For like 'tis said such a friend is a friend indeed
One who stands by you when you are feeling down
A cash strapped and depressed poor soul of the town
'Tis when you are most in need your friend you come to know
You ask one you thought was a good mate for a small loan his answer to you no
One who is not short of money of which you are aware
Yet a ten dollar note for you he could not spare
Yet a person you did not know well one you had met a few times before
Gave you the ten dollars and asked did you need more
That this person is your friend you've come to realize
In life every day there is some new surprise
In retrospect in years from now you will recall
That those you thought were your friends not your friends after all
A lesson for us to be learned from life every day
Life is a great teacher it does seem that way.
