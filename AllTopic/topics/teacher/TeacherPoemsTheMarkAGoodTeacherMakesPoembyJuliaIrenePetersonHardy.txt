That little cherub sitting there
With eager eyes and expectant air
Who knows what he may become...
Perhaps a doctor, lawyer, preacher
Policeman, executive, senator or 'rep'
He could blossom into another good teacher.
He might even become our President
Or be well-equipped for other walks in life.
That little one may prove to be
History's essential vital link
Because a good teacher made him-- think!
