I ask a question
And am showered in grace
My tongue wags
And there is no answer
I am silent
And there are no questions
Only the inner love
That knows all the answers.
Before the questions were born.
I approach him with an empty heart
And he fills it with good tidings
I offer him blind words
And he gives them eyes
I offer him my dumb tongue
And he speaks eloquence in essence
He takes my tears as full stops
And breathes new life in old meanings,
I cannot find the words
But thankfulness;
Speaks without end.
