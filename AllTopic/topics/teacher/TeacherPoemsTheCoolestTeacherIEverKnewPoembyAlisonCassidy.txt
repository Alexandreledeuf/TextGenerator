Pat was the coolest teacher I ever knew.
My kids adored him.
He hated hypocrisy
and cant.
Pat loved kids.
Had two of his own
and a wife called Jan
whom he didn't like much.
Actually Pat didn't like ANY grown ups
very much.
He was belligerently left wing
(got into politics later)
Hated injustice
and most grown ups.
He used word conversations
to teach kids to read.
Let them use rude words too -
like bum and fart.
First time I saw him
he was covered with kids -
reading Mr Silly on the old couch.
He had a curly beard,
long hair tied in a rubber band
and blue eyes that really twinkled.
When he took the kids
to the local oval to play cricket
he always guaranteed a draw.
Said no one should take sport
too seriously.
Pat was the coolest teacher I ever knew.

and cant.
Some people said he was rude
(I suppose he was) .
