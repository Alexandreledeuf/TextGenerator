My teacher is my knowledge bank
If I do not know anything,
I do not hesitate, I am always free & frank…
My teacher motivates me a lot....
That actually helps me,
To improve my power of thought...
When my teacher says, “Well done! ”
I get thrilled, I feel flattered...
I never like to show her my home work undone...
When I forget my lunch, she shares her tiffin
When I am tired, I feel sleepy,
She does not mind to write my next day’s routine...
My teacher never scolds me if I am wrong...
Rather she shows me the way
How to make that part strong....
I always want to impress my teacher...
Not only in studies but everywhere,
Every day I want to perform better...
I love my teacher, I respect her a lot
I should never disobey her
As she teaches me what to do and what not...
