She so loved Him
was so beloved of Him
that He spoke to her and said
my beloved
ask of Me whatsoever you wish
and she said
without hesitation
my Lord,
fill my life
with difficulty
for at those times
I cry out
for You
and feel nearest to You
and if, for the working-out
of my own destiny
or for the love of Your world
must I be born again
have me born
in the most difficult of times
in the most difficult of places
and make me a man
that I may walk barefoot
and bloody
with only one leg
over a path of swords
