Don’t go downward
Into dark sunless thoughts;
Don’t remove tenderness
From your plans
Or from your heart;
Don’t be afraid
Of being fragile and child-like
As you wind your way
Through minefields and snares
Along prickly emotional paths
Of the social landscape.
It is impossible to escape
Loneliness and heartbreak,
But you have to celebrate
The immense, poignant beauty
Of your fears, flaws, and mistakes;
You have to relish every avenue
Your human life does take.
