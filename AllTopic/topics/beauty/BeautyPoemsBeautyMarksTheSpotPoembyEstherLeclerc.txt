Beauty marks are meant for kissing...
This girl's are found in places pleasing:
On her neck, scented and lissome,
On rounded cheek with smile so teasing.
Another hides where seldom seen
By curious eyes in day or dark;
Yet when she dresses privately
That curve 'bove breast shows beauty's mark.
These sweet signs of Venus's blessing
Are meant for enlightened men of earth
Who ken that women crave much kissing
for their beauty and inner worth.
