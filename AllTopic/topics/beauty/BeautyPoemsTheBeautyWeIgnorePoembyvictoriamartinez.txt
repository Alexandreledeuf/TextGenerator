I am the beauty
The beauty in the summer *the heat*
We ignore it
.
I am the beauty
The beauty in the winter *frozen cold*
We ignore it
.
I am the beauty
The beauty in the fall *dying life*
We ignore it
.
I am the beauty
The beauty in the spring *birth of nature*
We ignore it
.
I am earth
I bare all seasons
And you ignore me
