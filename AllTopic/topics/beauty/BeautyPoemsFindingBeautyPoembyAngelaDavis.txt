I went for a walk with my love
down to an old vacant lot she took me
littered, and broken up
it made me sad,
made me think of myself
I asked why she took me there
she silently smiled
and took my hand
led me to a place
The pavement was cracked
the ground heaped with garbage
old and new
near a makeshift shelter
that some one had left
She kissed my tears away
told me to smile
when I asked why
she told me to open my eyes
leaving me confused
she said to look at the beauty
surrounding us
then began to point
the doorway of the crude shack
was open, and the was a spiderweb
moist with the morning dew
small dropp formed at it ran down
and it was beautiful
A few feet away
there was a daffodil
growing, thriving
despite the battered tarmac
through which it found a way
standing tall and proud
as well it should
and it was beautiful
Just then we looked up
and what did we see
a blue jay landing atop the roof
and began singing it's song
The sun was rising
peaking over the horizon
painting it red, orange,
yellow, and even violet
the sky was it's canvas
and it was beautiful
She took me home
pointing at many other things
while we strolled home
when we got there
I thanked her
told her she was beautiful
she stood me in front a mirror
telling me to find the beauty
there we stood for many long minutes
I looked, I saw, I contemplated
the sorrow carved into my features
the gentle wonder in my eyes
the scars life has left upon me
and it was beautiful
