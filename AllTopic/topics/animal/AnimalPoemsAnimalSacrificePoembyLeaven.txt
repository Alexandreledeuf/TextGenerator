Sacrifice unto me
The animal of thyself,
That tainted clothing
Of thy pride and flesh.
Andâ€¦
With thy kneeling heart
And tears unfeigned,
Call upon the sword of truth
To cleave thy soul in twain.
To divide thy darkness
From thy light
And remove from thee
Thy sin
And sacrifice at last
Thy carnality
And the blackness
Of the beast within.
