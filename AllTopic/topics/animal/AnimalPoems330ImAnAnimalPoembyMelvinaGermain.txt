This morning I’m a feline,
walking with grace.
Hips swaying side to side
Head held high, tilted slightly.
Slowly moving in to manipulate you.
This afternoon I’m a dog,
Needy, wanting, loving.
snuggling in your lap,
feeling the warmth of your body,
enjoying every precious moment.
Tonight I’m a tiger,
gracefully moving toward you
with great anticipation.
I’ll take you down,
you will be mine.
I’m an animal most of the time.
