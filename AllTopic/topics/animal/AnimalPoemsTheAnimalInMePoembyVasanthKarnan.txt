The world which was once beautiful,
Is now a dark blank scary place,
The memories which were treasured as life giving,
Are now haunting ghosts of the past,
Pushing me to sleepless nights.
Every day and  every moment,
I spent with you,
Are carved in my heart.
You said time will heal everything,
But it seems to carve those memories deeper.
Those eyes which were filled with love once,
Are now filled with hatred,
Since they saw that animal,
Which lurks within me
