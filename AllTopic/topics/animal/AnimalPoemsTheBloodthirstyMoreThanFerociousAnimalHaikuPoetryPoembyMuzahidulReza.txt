The Bloodthirsty More Than Ferocious Animal (Haiku Poetry)
January 28, 2020
▌
The bloodthirsty are
Sucking blood of human through,
Killing, massacring.
▌▌
They are ferocious
Lions, tigers, bears, hyenas
Blood sucking they go.
▌▌▌
They are always so!
Suck blood and laugh ho, ho, ho
Humans tremble, oh!
