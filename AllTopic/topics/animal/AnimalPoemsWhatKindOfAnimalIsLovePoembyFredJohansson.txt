Love is the most beautiful thing alive..
You might not think its alive, but it is.
Love is a living parasite who can make huge changes in their victim.
To notice infection you feel it, for example if your heart feels like clouds
and if your feets feel like they want to take air.
Love is known for its wonderful gift of corrupting humans.
It colour is red and blue. Soft colours that makes you calm.
There is no cure but as it is alive it also dies.
