It is beautiful wish
That finishes
With welfare for people
Who daily struggle
There is no end to desires
Which sometimes misfire?
Catch us on wrong foot
And in misdirection shoot
To wish for all
And give lovely call
It is sign of good soul
That never smells foul
Let us all pray
For comfortable stay
And spend the rest of the journey
With nice feeling of being happy
Let us remain earthly animals
And call for good human
It is need of an hour
As this one is holy tour
