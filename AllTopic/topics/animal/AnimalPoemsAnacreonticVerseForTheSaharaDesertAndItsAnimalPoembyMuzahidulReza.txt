Sahara desert
Rare oasis around
Hardly rain there
Dry leaves, dead sand
Some deadly herbs
As hot, hard stone;
The deathstalker
Namely scorpion,
The thorny devil,
The silver ant,
The scarab beetle,
The sand viper,
Horrible reptiles,
Desert hyenas,
Foxes, wild dogs;
Leopard, cheetahs;
And some hungry
Poisonous and
Ferocious beings
There live in;
Dry heart year round
No mercy in mind.
