Animal is a creature:
A mammal,
Or beast,
Can be a brute,
Or a swine,
At best as a human being...
Known as... a living thing!
Animal is made of:
A flesh,
Some skeletons,
Litters of blood,
A weight of brain,
With gut of feelings...
Excited by... a sexual drive!
Animal is of all sort,
Has different breed,
But one thing is universal...
Survival...is an animal instinct!
