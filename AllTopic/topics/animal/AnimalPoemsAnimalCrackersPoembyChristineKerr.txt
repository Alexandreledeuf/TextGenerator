Can you enjoy a meal,
If it ain't your Cat.
Is he mad as a Dog,
or blind as a Bat.
Could he be Chicken,
Doing a gig.
or
Roars  like a Lion;
and snorts  like a Pig.
Perhaps he's
Mean as a  Bear
Sly as a Fox
Quiet as a Mouse.
Or big as an Ox.
If I wonder anymore,
what he might be.
Would he fly like a Bird
or sting like a Bee
This has probably been done,
One way, or another.
Guess I better eat my words,
Before they turn to Butter,
