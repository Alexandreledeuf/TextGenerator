The party was great
I was having a good time
Laughing and dancing
I was coming up for air
From the life of the party
Standing on the balcony
In the fresh autumn air
It seemed to penetrate my skin
Leaving me refreshed
I stepped back inside
Smiling at my many friends
I’m watching the couples
Decide and others wait
I’m pouring myself
Another absolut vodka
When it hits my lips
My personal anguish
Comes through the door
With the bearded man
On a short leash of course
It only brings back
Awful moments
What is in her face?
That is so familiar
Is her face
From another life?
I look the other way
Having out grown her
We have the same friends
Which makes awkward meets?
I shake hands
With the bearded man
Thinking what does she see in that?
Cause I’m like Brad Pitt
Compared to that
Maybe it’s the pocket
Full of coke
As she smiles at me
She sniffles a little
I hug her
And kiss her on the lips
Just so the bearded man
Gets unglued for a moment
And doubts himself
She sends her pet
For a couple of beers
My crazy beach of an ex-wife
Looks pretty hot
In the little black dress
But I’m sure
That is part of the plan
She looks me in the eyes
And says our fifteen years
Wasn’t so bad
Maybe for her, not me!
The bearded man then appears
Wearing a frown
But she jerks his leash
Making him heel
Just then, Megan my date
Rescues me with a hug
And a juicy kiss
Now the bearded man smiles
And crazy beach of an ex-wife
Is frowning
I just tip my head
Grin and pull Megan
Towards the door
Wanting to Make-Love
Not Strife anymore
