Going crazy right now
Need some help real bad
He wont leave my mind
And I dont know why
Even after he cheated and lied
No guy could replace this
His causing me so much pain
Yet I know I love him
He plays me like a fool
Says we're over
Than wants a cuddle
It's driving me up the wall
I need to lose him
Get him outta my mind
This just isn't right
I love him to dearly
He doesnt love me
Thats for sure
Im going crazy
He just wont leave
My heart or mind
