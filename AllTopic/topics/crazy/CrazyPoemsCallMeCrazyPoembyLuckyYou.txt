Call me crazy,
But I’m beginning to think that maybe,
Maybe she was right.
Perhaps it’s time for you to take flight,
Leave me sitting here, cursed,
So you can be with the friend who comes first.
I defended you, said you were a friend,
But I think it’s time for those words to come to an end.
I once heard: “Love many, trust few”
I thought I trusted you, but now I see that this friendship isn’t true.
I waved to you and said “Hi, ”
Now I’m waving, but this time saying “Bye.”
Soon, I’ll cry and make a big deal,
I’ll cry, but I’ll keep this promise sealed.
Just like Taylor said, “I can’t breath without you,
But I have too.”
It’s beginning to get cold
It feels like, to you, my heart’s been sold.
I go sit on the cold ground out side,
And abide for you to choose your side.
Have you ever thought that maybe, your wrong, not me?
Perhaps that’s the key.
Now you can say you’re sorry all you want,
But know she was right again, you’re not.
You’re not Sorry.
