I see a crazy man by the door,
He is old and worn.
He wears a blanket over his head,
Likes to be unknown.
He looks up and above,
Glancing far and wide,
He is the man everyone frights.
I see a crazy man by the door,
And out of sight.
He yells and screams till dawn,
And retreats once we are gone.
For he is the crazy man I see by the door every night.
