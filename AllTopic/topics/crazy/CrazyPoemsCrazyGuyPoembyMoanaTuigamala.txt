Crazy was he,
As crazy as can be!
No one else was crazier than he,
No one was that crazy for me!
In his eyes was adoration,
From his lips was admiration.
But, in his heart there was LOVE!
And that was a problem never to be solved.
For he kept on coming,
While I kept on running.
He kept on trying,
While I kept on lying.
Yes, it was a problem without a solution,
But he took the risk of this situation.
To me, I salute this young man honestly,
For all the effort he's put in for me!
