Can’t help, starin’ at you
Wonderin’ what the hell is on you
Can’t help, lookin’ at you
Your thoughtful eyes
Is all I’m thinkin’ of
Refrain:
Boy, you got me on my feet
You make my heart skip a beat
Can you tell me what I feel
Is this love that I’m feeling
Chorus:
Boy, I’m crazy
Tell me, am I crazy
When I let myself fall
When I hardly even know you
Boy, I’m crazy
Tell me that I’m crazy
When I said that love
Won’t have a chance
But why the hell did I give you
The chance of a lifetime
(To love me)
Ooh…
Crazy
Can’t help, fallin’ for you
With just one smile
You melt my worries away
Can’t help, wonderin’ to myself
Why I’m feeling so in love with you
Refrain 2:
Boy, you’re not everything
That I’ve always dreaming
Can you give me all the reasons
Why my heart should feel this way
For you
(Repeat Chorus)
0oh woah
Bridge:
I can’t understand myself
I can’t understand this heart
So why don’t you just
Prove it all to me
That you deserve my everything
When I said that I wouldn’t love again
But now my heart is screaming your name
