I'm crazy, crazy to write at leisure.
Working, only working will end never.
To serve family, to make all happy
I'm busy with caring for all but me.
Day passes quickly; night comes silently.
Midnight appears and I feel so crazy.
No sleep as 'tis leisure to love my heart.
I leave my pen when sunshine falls on earth.
I'm crazy, crazy to create a new earth.
As my Love is so to caress my heart.
I am crazy, crazy only to fly
On the wings of poesy in a new sky.
No matter if others call me crazy.
For my Love, for my poetry I'm crazy.
