A shadow with me all day
No body
This is crazy, this is crazy
Notes of a scintillating flute
No flutist
This is crazy, this is crazy
Breathtaking verse on paper
I was sleeping
This is crazy, this is crazy
Vermilion laden sky
Sunrise or sunset?
This is crazy, this is crazy
Dishevelled clothes, swollen lips
You came in my dream
I am crazy, I am crazy
Or is this the only sanity? ?
