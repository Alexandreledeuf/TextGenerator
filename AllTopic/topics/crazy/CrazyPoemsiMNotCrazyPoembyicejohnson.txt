I have a premonition in my heart
A little touch of a feeling
You'll end up with me
No way have we spent time in anyway
You passing me by changed my life
(Saturday night, under dimmed light, your eyes so shimmering in a crowd of a thousand)
Your going to end up with me
and no, I'm not crazy.
You said you saw something in me
you've never wanted so bad in your life
Everyone thinks I've gone crazy
My heart tells me no, I'm not.
Your hug goodbye made me believe
Your going to fall in love with me with someday
Now that I've made my dream come true
It's only a matter of time you follow my footsteps
and surprise me when I turn around
You said to me, you loved me
and I knew I wasn't crazy...
