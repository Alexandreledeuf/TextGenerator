In this room right now
There's only me and you
It's just us
No one's around
Smiling to one another
We say the things we want to do
So let's be in love
Let's go insane, let's go crazy
We're only holding out for each other
We're not trying to fall in vain
I'll take your hand and place it over my heart
You take mine and place it over yours
Tonight the candles will burn
Tonight our love will be born
Tonight our love will fall over
And all around us
Tonight our love will not be torn
As we fall in love
As we go insane and go crazy
