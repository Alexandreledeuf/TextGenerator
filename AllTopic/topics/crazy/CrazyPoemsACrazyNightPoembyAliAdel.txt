One night, in the dead of night
Seven girls, one guy
Watched the torture of a girl on TV
The most disturbing, terrifying horror movie
When the film reached the end
Three girls and the guy got up and left
Way past curfew, to the park
With hopes to get scared in the dark
While the other four girls' stayed at home
Trying to figure out where to go
Something else was happening...
Shallow, low, and backstabbing
The one guy in the group stole a bottle of brandy
From my, one of the girls', kitchen pantry
Did I mention I was his girlfriend?
Having said that, you would think that would have stopped him!
They passed it around
As they sat at the playground
Got a warm, fuzzy tingle
And started to mingle
So I guess,
We'll call her 'S'
And he,
Will be called 'D'
Apparently neither were thinking of me
D licked candy off S's chest
'D' then played with S's breasts
They knew it was wrong, at least she did
But the crime was done, lied and cheated
When they got home and asked if they had fun
They glanced at each other and said 'Uh huh.'
From the guilty look in their twinkling eyes
I had a gut a feeling something wasn't right
Did they really think they would get away with this?
Sweep it under the rug? Throw a blanket over it?
Well in my book those aren't the rules
I don't play like that, you fools
As the night went on
Tears were shed
Trust was gone
Apologies made
Sincere hugs gave
The love had stayed
At least some, anyway
D never made an apology
D never kissed and made up with me
He just grinned and held his head high
He just stuck his chest to the sky
Pretending everything was just alright
Not even thinking of this crazy night
In the end, I thought long and hard
Gave him a second chance for a new start
But he never did clean up his act
So eventually I told him,
'Hit the road Jack! '
