Am I crazy, for feeling the way
that I do?
For every waking moment my
thoughts are all of you.
If I lost the bliss of your sweet
kiss, I know not what i'd do.
I would pine away in just one day.
This I know is true.
~
Am I crazy, when this is the way
I feel?
Should I pinch myself to find out
if this feeling is really real? The
beauty of your love has my head
all in a spin. As my heart beats
mellifluously and deep for you
within.
~
Am I crazy, for craving your love
that's so divine?
For needing to hold you closely
in these loving arms of mine.
Darling if i'm crazy for loving you
the way that I do. If I am my love
please keep it, our little secret.
Just between me and you....
