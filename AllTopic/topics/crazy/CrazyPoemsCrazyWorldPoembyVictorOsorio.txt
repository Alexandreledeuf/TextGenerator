When she talks about love
Does she talk about you
When you feel alive
When you feel unseen
The world is blue
It's raining, so you walk
It's raining, so you talk
Thoughts are the walls
That close your mind down
Your heart once full of love
But shes not around
Maybe you're meant to be alone
In this crazy world
Everyone is on their own
Not everybody is happy
Yet we seem that way
Not everybody is lonely
Yet we seem that way
So when she talks about you
Does she talk about love.
