I go crazy now a day
To esteem you my dear Sun
Your shine, your rays
Hot.. Pierce my skin
Sweat me and drench even
I go crazy now a day
To worship you my dear Moon
Your milky shine, your smiling face
Make me gaze and gaze at you
And lost at you in merry thoughts
I go crazy now a day
To adore you my blue sky
Your sight, you void, beloved plane
Make me feel floating with
Foamy white, and grey folks
Brewing out of frisky frost
I go crazy now a day
To admire you my dear stars
Twinkling with frolic comets
Make me feel jealous of you
To be there, there in glee
Do you know it? why I am
Feeling crazy on you, dear
You only could see my love
Day and night nâ€™ round the clock
