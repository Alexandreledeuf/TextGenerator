I am not Emo
I’m not a Goth
I’m perfectly normal
But I know what it feels to be lost
Stuck in the crowd
Can’t hear a sound
Feels like I’m pushed back in the distance
Can’t come out
Do people see?
Do they believe?
Or am I just crazy from being lonely?
The words burst from my lips as I scream
But the people around me don’t seem to hear a thing
Am I invisible? Am I going crazy?
The world is acting like they don’t know about me
Am I forgotten? Am I just crazy?
Am I just lost? Am I just lonely?
Somebody hear me
Somebody save me
I check my phone, nobody calls
I can’t help, but feeling so forgot
I put on a show, nobody knows
Where did all the people I used to love, go?
I see a face, forgot its name
But they don’t seem to recognize me, anyway
All of my friends are with somebody else
And now I’m sitting here all by myself
(All by myself)
The words burst from my lips as I scream
(From my lips, as I scream)
But the people around me don’t seem to hear a thing
(But the people, don’t hear a thing)
Am I invisible? Am I going crazy?
(Am I invisible? Am I going crazy?)
The world is acting like they don’t know about me
(Acting like, don’t know about me)
Am I forgotten? Am I going crazy?
(Am I forgotten? Am I going crazy?)
Am I just lost? Am I just lonely?
(Am I just lost, maybe I’m lonely)
Somebody hear me
(Somebody near me)
Somebody save me
(Somebody save me)
Or am I just crazy?
Or am I just crazy?
(Maybe, oh maybe)
I took a chance, got sick of the burn
There’s no need of me, to feel so undeserved
People walk by, I try to say hi
But they even try to talk to me, why?
Is it my face? Is it my name?
Or am I just overreacting, and going insane?
I know they see me, I know they see me
So why are they leaving?
Why did they leave me?
The words burst from my lips as I scream
(From my lips, as I scream)
But the people around me don’t seem to hear a thing
(People around me, don’t hear a thing)
Am I invisible? Am I going crazy?
(Am I invisible? Am I going crazy?)
The world is acting like they don’t know about me
(Acting like, don’t know about me)
Am I forgotten? Am I going crazy?
(Am I forgotten? Am I going crazy?)
Am I just lost? Am I just lonely?
(Am I? , maybe I’m lonely)
Somebody hear me
(Somebody near me)
Somebody save me
(Somebody please save me)
Or am I just crazy?
Or am I just crazy?
(Maybe, oh just maybe)
Live life they say, it’s the only you’ve got
But how can you live? How can you give?
If there’s nothing you’ve got
Well I’ve got myself, and I’ve got my dreams
But I guess I’ll just have to live them separately
Stuck in the shadow, I need someone else
How can I get them to notice me, so I won’t be by myself?
Do you hear?
Do you see?
Or am I just another nobody, who has nothing? (nothing)
The words burst from my lips as I scream
(From my lips, as I scream)
But the people around me don’t seem to hear a thing
(People around me, don’t hear a thing)
Am I invisible? Am I going crazy?
(Am I invisible? Am I going crazy?)
The world is acting like they don’t know about me
(Acting like, they don’t know me)
Am I forgotten? Am I going crazy?
(Am I forgotten? Am I going crazy?)
Am I just lost? Am I just lonely?
(Am I just lost, maybe I’m lonely)
Somebody hear me
(Somebody near me)
Somebody save me
(Somebody save me)
Or am I just crazy?
Or am I just crazy?
(Maybe, oh maybe just maybe)
When I cry, I only cry to myself
I’m alone; I wish I had somebody else
Oh
When I cry, I only cry to myself
I’m alone; I wish I had somebody else
Oh
When I cry, I only cry to myself
I’m alone; I wish I had somebody else
The words burst from my lips as I scream
(From my lips, as I scream)
But the people around me don’t seem to hear a thing
(People around me, don’t hear a thing)
Am I invisible? Am I going crazy?
(Am I invisible? Am I going crazy?)
The world is acting like they don’t know about me
(Acting like, they don’t know me)
Am I forgotten? Am I going crazy?
(Am I forgotten? Am I going crazy?)
Am I just lost? Am I just lonely?
(Am I just lost, maybe I’m lonely)
Somebody hear me
(Somebody near me)
Somebody save me
(Somebody save me)
Or am I just crazy?
(Am I crazy?)
Or am I just crazy?
(Maybe, oh maybe)
Just maybe
Maybe I’m crazy
(Save me)
Maybe I’m crazy
(Don’t forget me)
Maybe I’m crazy
(Don’t go baby no)
Maybe I’m crazy
Just maybe
Maybe
