Sometimes when the pain from your absence
Reaches in my body and heart the level ten
I don’t know what to do…
I start hallucinating, shouting, and calling your name
Even I cry silently
Without caring that this is in our eastern society
Is considered a big shame…
What should I do?
Should I call your mobile phone even if you don’t answer?
Should I go to your flat and knock on the door even if you don’t open?
Should I send you an e-mail even if you will not read?
Should I go to the pub and drink till I loose my consciousness?
Should I dance in the middle of the street and sleep all night on the beach?
Should I contact my previous girlfriend and apologize for quitting her?
Should I throw myself in the bed of the first prostitute I will meet?
How should react to all my crazy thoughts?
You know what is best to do
When the pain from your absence
Reaches in my body and heart the level ten…
Is simply to calm down
And leave the speech to my sincere mirror...
To my best friend…
My lovely pen…
Wael Karameh.
