“Crazy”
Is it just me?
Or am I just crazy?
Where did I go?
That I don’t know
Alone in the darkness
Nothing but sadness
Crying dirty tears
It seems like my eyes never clear
No hope!
Nope
No faith!
Can’t take
No happiness!
Nothing but sadness
No love!
I know it’s only coming from above
No life
No life
Am I crazy?
Or is it just me?
