Forrest's foliage flourishes as branches
out...The wild animals hide and peek their
heads all about.Forrest trees can turn
ablaze...From this smoke, eyes can be singed
within the blinding haze.Aft' the smoke
finally does abate...This evidenced damage
of this imaged bad state.The removal of
all it's pride from this infernal's sad
fate.Cleanup and replanting may take
awhile...Restoring it's beauty from man's
careless defile! 01-09-2006'.
