It's like I'm going crazy out of my mind
Cause images of you holding my waist from behind
It's crazy how fast I fell in LOVE
Knowing that you're far away I'm missing your kisses and hugs
It's crazy how I can't do any of my work in my classes
Cause the whole time I'm thinking how you keep me laughin
It's crazy how I want to be your wifey
Cause your time is worth more than anything you can buy me
It's crazy how I know we can make sweet music together
And I'll lock you in my heart always and forever.
