A guy came to me the other day saying some crazy stuff
He said he hate what  I do  and what i stand for, to not hit him was ruff
Why do people tend to not look from outside of the boots
I say they need to read a history book on american roots
Some of the comments I hear, I see people can be very crazy
They dont see the pride in the soldiers I fight with daily
Out here where Im at, we are all we got
Even tho we know americans back home got our back
I wish that guy could have seen the day a lil iraqi boy gave me a flower
He said thank you america for your courage and power
His english was kind of broken but I knew what he ment to say
We made it so at least that one lil boy can come back out and play
At my level we dont see saving the world
All we see is making a way for some little boy or little girl
So think twice when you approach me with somthing crazy to say
I fight for so much more than what you saw on the news today
So go have sweet dreams and sleep peaceful tonite
All will be secure, cause american soldiers will continue to fight
