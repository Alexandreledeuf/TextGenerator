Every time you yell,
It's almost like a bridge collapsing.
Every time I cry,
It's like I'm about to reach my breaking point.
These scars on my arms aren't just scars.
They tell stories.
When you get in my face.
I'll make sure I will punch you.
Get too close
I'll shove you away
Break my heart
I'll just walk away.
You see...
You don't scare me.
You don't frighten me.
You don't intimidate me.
So just walk away and forget.
Nothing happened you see.
You are just going crazy..
