I promised to write you a poem
Every day in a year.
Every day a new flower.
I promised to write flowers for you
I promised to write you a fairy tale
Every day in a year.
I promised something new
And I promised to collect it.
I promised to keep you high—
You were afraid you might fall.
I promised my words to your throne
To keep the foundation strong
I promised to write your memory,
And rewrite your thoughts.
I promised not to let you fall,
For my words keep the throne.
And after every promise delivered
We were crazier and did not believe
How easy it was to keep promises
And how easy it is to be crazy.
And after every word became a bird,
And every word became a flower,
We knew how good it is to be crazy—
And you loved my madness
Your fear had no basis.
You were comfortable
In your magnificent role.
We promised we would not stop.
We promised never to stop writing poems.
We promised to keep the words flying.
We promised to keep the throne fresh and alive.
We promised to stay crazy.
