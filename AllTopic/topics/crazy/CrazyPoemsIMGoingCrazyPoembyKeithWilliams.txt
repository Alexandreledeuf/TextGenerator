Every since the day I went away and left you
So lonely and cold
What could I do?
I thought about myself
I never meant to hurt you
I had to go away to see if love was through
One day you send me a letter
Telling me that you loved me
And you still care
I broke down and cried
What did I do?
I left a love so true
I’m going crazy
Out my mind, yeah
Don’t think that I’m lazy
To come back to you, girl
I want you to be my lady
I’m so sorry
For leaving me you my baby
Please forgive me
I’ve been so naïve
I’m going crazy
Every word I say is hard to express myself
I have to start somewhere, baby
Can help me?
Save me from myself
I just want to let you know that I love you too
Or else my heart gets broken
What a fool I’ve been
What else can I do?
One day you send me a letter
Telling me that you loved me
And you still care
I broke down and cried
What did I do?
I left a love so true
I’m going crazy
Out my mind, yeah
Don’t think that I’m lazy
To come back to you, girl
I want you to be my lady
I’m so sorry
For leaving me you my baby
Please forgive me
I’ve been so naïve
I’m going crazy
I have to let you I need you so very much
I have to let you I need to feel your touch
I have to let you the things I done was so wrong
I just don't know
But I realize I need your love
Every since you wrote to me
I cannot speak
My eyes are gonna leak
I my heart’s getting so weak
Everything I do
I think of you
What am I gonna do
Tell me if this love is true
One day you send me a letter
Telling me that you loved me
And you still care
I broke down and cried
What did I do?
I left a love so true
I’m going crazy
Out my mind, yeah
Don’t think that I’m lazy
To come back to you, girl
I want you to be my lady
I’m so sorry
For leaving me you my baby
Please forgive me
I’ve been so naïve
I’m going crazy
