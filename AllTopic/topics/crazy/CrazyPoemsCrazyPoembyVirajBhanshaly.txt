When darkness spread
All were dead,
Animals, freedom and all.
Terrain was moved
The sky was grooved,
The earth started to call.
Crazy crazy life is lest
Once thou, the best of best,
Now we shall never rest,
Crazy crazy is the crest.
When darkness spread
All were dead,
Animals, freedom and all.
The earth in despair
Will take the share,
For CRAZY is the fall.
