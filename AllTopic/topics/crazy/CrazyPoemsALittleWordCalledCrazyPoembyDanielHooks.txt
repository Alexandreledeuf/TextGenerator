A little word called crazy
Which people use when they are being lazy.
The word crazy covers a multi of goods and ills
Mad, bad, sad, cool
or even acting the fool.
It's used in our everyday language
But it's often misunderstood
But it fits into sentences so well (and so good)
Sometimes you can't seem to see the origins for this word
it sounds so absurd the way its used and abused
like crazy baby, crazy sin, a crazy outer and a crazy in!
Crazy actually means mad insane or foolish
so says the dictionary
but you can be crazy in love with someone
perhaps we are all crazy to be using this word
maybe it's so absurd that you can use it in so many ways
in everyday life.
But the English language is good like that!
