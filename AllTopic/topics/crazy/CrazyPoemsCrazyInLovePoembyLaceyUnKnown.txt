The phone rings
I jump
Is it him?
It’s him!
Finally
I take a deep breath
And flip open my phone
Hello?
I ask casually
Smiling sweetly
He answers
Hey, it’s me
My heart skips a beat
When I hear his voice
His beautiful baritone voice
When he tells me he misses me
I feel chills through my spine
In my mind
I can see
His chocolate brown eyes
Twinkling, shining as he looks my way
His gorgeous grin
His every little move
Drives me crazy
Everything about him
Makes me crazy
So guess I must be
Crazy
Crazy in love
