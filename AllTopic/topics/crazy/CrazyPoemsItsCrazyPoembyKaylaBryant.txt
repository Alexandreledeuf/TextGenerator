It's crazy how a person changes,
after you knew them so well.
It's crazy how fast feelings can change,
from heaven into hell.
It's crazy how I thought I knew you,
and you changed right before my eyes.
It's crazy how I thought you were the real thing,
then you pulled on a deceiving disguise.
Forgive me please, I've been a fool.
None other than a fool for you.
Your not the person I once knew,
but I refuse to change myself for you.
I am me and that's all that matters to me.
Now how long will it take you to see,
that i'm done with all the tears I cry.
This is 'i'm sorry' for the last time.
