all alone in this crazy home trapped in this room
no one here to talk too
but what i hear a whisperin soul
i am not crazy
the walls begin to make strange faces the devil itself
no i am not crazy
where did these scars come from i didnt do this
it was that shadow of darkness
no i'm definitely not crazy
who is dat woman in the bloody white gown
a slit at the throat the fire in her eyes
i am not crazy
docters come to give me my dosage
dead
cut to pieces
blood every where
my insides are my outsides
they said i was crazy
but i'm not i'm insane
