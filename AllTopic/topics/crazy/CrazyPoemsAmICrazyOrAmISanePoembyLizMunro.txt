Why do I feel so down and alone?
My heart is so cold and icy
like icebergs in the Atlantic
and it's frozen fingers
touch and chill me to the bone.
Am I crazy or am I sane?
Got these depressing thoughts
circling like angry sharks in my brain
Is it false or is it true?
Can I really believe what i'm told by you?
my mind is going cookcoo,
And it is all because of the stupid un-thinking things you do.
