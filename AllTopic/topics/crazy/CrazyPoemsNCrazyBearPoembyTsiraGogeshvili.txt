The bear has received the inheritance,
The grandfather his was richer;
Slept clumsy on a pillow...
The Pillow  probably, not as all…
Yesterday a bear the dream has dreamt,
Thought does not take out, thought will be lost
Bees did not give something sweet
The bear became crazy - a syndrome caries
The bear has jumped out of dens …
The bear runs with a pillow,
And it is a pillow uneasy!
This the inheritance - Pandora's box...
