Not have another cigarette, you surely must be jesting
It is my sense of humour that you can only be testing
You obviously don't realise that without them I cannot function
I must have them before breakfast, after dinner and after luncheon
I must have them when I'm anxious and have them when relaxed
I must have them when I'm on the phone and when I smell a rat
I must have them when I concentrate and have them when I rest
I must have them watching television and have them on a quest
I must have them in the daylight and have them when night falls
I must have them when a short time passes or even no time passing at all
I must have them when I see them or when they're out of sight
I must have them first thing in the morning and the very last thing at night
I must have them when I'm talking and have them when I'm breathing
I must have them when I'm walking and have them when I'm sneezing
Do you understand what I am trying to tell you?
I must have them
