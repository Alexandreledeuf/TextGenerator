If you think i'm crazy
You should meet my friend
When my madness it is over
She continues to the end
I stand there open speechless
And wondering at times
Whether it is me or she or it
Who have lost their minds
If you think i'm crazy
Then i'd ask you for a while
To put false dreams behind you
And take the time to smile
For if you think i'm crazy
Then there's only one thing left
To reassure your sanity
And always always let
The providence of madness
Strike deep inside your core
For in a mad mad mad mad world
Who could want for more?
