why does it hurt when i smile?
cut when i call your name?
i think i'll sit alone a while,
and dream of life without pain.
why am i better depressed?
it seems to fit so well.
my fresh cuts still undressed,
high from the bloods smell.
why do you run from me?
i'm really not that bad.
open your heart and now see,
there's a reason that i'm sad.
i'm sorry i cant tell you,
but please don't run away!
don't you know what its like to be hated too?
to fear each second of the day?
you act like i'm a killer,
and like i'm after you.
its just like in a thriller,
your the perfect victim too.
