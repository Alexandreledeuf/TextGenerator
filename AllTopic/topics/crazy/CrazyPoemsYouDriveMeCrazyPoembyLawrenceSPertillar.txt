You drive me crazy.
And I must,
Like...
The craze.
You drive me crazy.
You drive me crazy.
Say...
You drive me crazy.
And I must,
Like...
The craze.
You drive me crazy.
You drive me crazy.
All day long...
I knock my head against the wall.
Holding on...
To nothing that I own at all.
When night falls...
I need some time to just relax.
And not be nit picked behind my back.
With a nagging done by a maniac.
You drive me crazy.
And I must,
Like...
The craze.
You drive me crazy.
You drive me crazy.
Say...
You drive me crazy.
And I must,
Like...
The craze.
You drive me crazy.
You drive me crazy.
All day long...
I knock my head against the wall.
Holding on...
To nothing that I own at all.
When night falls...
I need some time to just relax.
And not be nit picked behind my back.
With a nagging done by a maniac.
Who greets me with verbal attacks.
And saps my energy like that.
Why can't I get my baggage packed.
And leave this scene before I scream.
All day long...
I knock my head against the wall.
Holding on...
To nothing that I own at all.
Why can't I get my baggage packed.
And leave this scene before I scream.
You drive me crazy.
And I must,
Like...
The craze.
You drive me crazy.
You drive me crazy.
Say...
You drive me crazy.
And I must,
Like...
The craze.
You drive me crazy.
You drive me crazy.
All day long...
You drive me crazy.
You drive me crazy.
Something's wrong...
You drive me crazy.
You drive me crazy.
And I must,
Like...
The craze.
You drive me crazy.
You drive me crazy.
And I must,
Like...
The craze.
