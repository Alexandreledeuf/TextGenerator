Explaining language rules to a five year old,
Can certainly be brain hacking.
I tried and cajoled,
But it only got more whacking.
I got real exasperated;
And Joan, more aggravated.
Why ‘Hand’ is singular, plural ‘Hands’
So are Trains, Cars and Trams.
But why Joan’s pretty Foot
Is not ‘Foots’ but Feet?
I’m vexed to answer why-
When I purchase, I Buy.
When tears roll, I cry.
But it is still incorrect;
If  ‘Buies’  appear in a sentence;
But ‘Cries’ is correct in presence.
Anne’s dog barks and she can hear it loud and clear;
But the tree barks, is not the same to hear.
‘Bite’ is a verb and so is a ‘bark’
So here is a new saying for Bill Gates dog.
“His bark is worse than his Byte! ’
But I cannot voice why, to a learner;
The day is cold, wet, or hot.
What a hot sun! ! Is never taught!
Nor the snow is cold, or the rain is wet.
You can get into a fit, and is totally silly.
‘Cause it is true in a Simile.
Ann spelt   S-I-G-H; She wrote  C-L-O-N-E
But went through a storm
Explaining the norm
Cyclone is not Sighclone.
The phone is an instrument
An electronic one as that.
Then should I write a ‘Pre’ or a ‘Post’
To reschedule my plans?
Goose is to Gander, Berry is to fruit.
Gooseberry now, has a gender issue?
And so it can be true
To say Bananaberry and Grapeberry,
Because they are berries too.
I sat finally perplexed, when she asked
“Did you see a Mango on a Coconut tree! ? ”
Yes of course! She said with glee.
A Man go on a coconut tree is possible!
In India everything is adorable! !
