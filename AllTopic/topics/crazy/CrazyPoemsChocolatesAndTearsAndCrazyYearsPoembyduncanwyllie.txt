What about tonight I said?
The big box in the window
My mum is short on money again
I feel that it's a sin though
We'll go tonight,
Stand outside shops
You’re on guard
Incase of cops
I burst through the door
Elderly couple, surprise
Fall from step what a blunder
Grab the box noise like thunder
Turn to see if couples gaining
Disbelief, faces remaining
Turn handle wrong way
Fight with it until I stray
Where's my school friend lookout
Half way up the hill
Wait for me I start to shout
Couple, still at till
We ran and ran, fools us both, up hill
Regret and relief set in
My Mothers Birthday tomorrow
Regret and relief turn to sorrow
Next morning I awake
To see mum eat evidence
How could you afford such a gift?
I feel it’s far from providence
Oh if I could turn back the clock
And tell that boy 'No Way'
Or teach about a conscience
That might keep him from going astray.
