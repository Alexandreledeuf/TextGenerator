You just don't relies how greatly I do care
Or maybe you do
I want to tell you things I shouldn't feel or that's what they say
I can bight my tongue
And hold back
The things we both feel
I want to tell you there is someone out there that really does care
I will just tell you that you are the man that makes me
A lost of words
‘Cause I know words will never be enough to give to you
You are the person that I look forward to each day,
The one that makes my day smile again even though my tears
Just to hear your voice makes my worries melt away
Your not just a man in first or second your the man.
The man of my waves and my fire
Will you be the one man to finally tame the restless storm?
Shall I kiss all my crazy immature nights’ goodbye?
Do I have to grow up drastically again?
Will I live and breathe within your eyes?
Like all my hope has desired
My heart flutters and may belong to you but only time will tell
How do I hang something up
When it's all that I know
As I see my crazy nights’ turn gray and disappearing in
The shadows of the last foot steps I take
The person I am stepping towards pulls too hard at times
Makes the brave turn weak
But maybe that’s what I need
Only time will tell
