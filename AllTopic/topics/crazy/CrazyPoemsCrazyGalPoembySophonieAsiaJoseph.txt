A perfect man?
Is there such a thing?
Have you fallen off a bin?
One with lot's of money
and lips as sweet as honey.
Everything he says, seem so funny
with a desirable chest, flat tummy.
You must be delusional
because these requests are quite unusual.
A perfect man?
Don't you dare say that again.
