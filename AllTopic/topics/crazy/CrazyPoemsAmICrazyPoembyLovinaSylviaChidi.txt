This is a poem that for me elaborates a little about the thought-provoking word ‘crazy’.
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
Stop!
They all look at me
With words spelling ‘Crazy’
Stop! Stop! Stop! Am I crazy?
I forever rant my thoughts to my daisy,
She stands in a vase all day playing lazy
Stop! Does this make me crazy?
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
An adult who still sleeps fondly with a doll
Is usually described ‘a screwball’
Stop! So am I crazy?
So what is crazy?
Talking to yourself alone on the day bus
Walking the street naked without a just cause
Sleeping under your bed daily without giving a toss
Speaking to the mirror, stating you are the boss
shitting in public, wondering why they are making such a fuss
Walking and talking like a man, instead of a lady
This poem is crazy
Stop! So am I crazy?
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
Ranting away in my new mental home
Doctors have labeled me half-baked
Simply because of a normal mistake
I stopped acting normal
First lost all my pals, labeling me ‘Animal’
When I’m only a meat and fish cannibal
I'm accused of being mentally deranged
Because I shouted in the supermarket
as I was dollar short-changed
They say I’m mentally unstable
Pump me up daily with drugs
While tied to the bed with crazy cables
Now who is the vicious thug?
But my thoughts are still perfectly capable
Of comprehending the new meaning of crazy
What is normal?
What is crazy?
How are we so damn sure, normal is not crazy?
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
Blah, Blah, Blah, the Blah!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Am I crazy?
