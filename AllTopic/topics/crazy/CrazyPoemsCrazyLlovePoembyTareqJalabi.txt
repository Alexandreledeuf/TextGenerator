I am holding a knife
By which to end my life
Driving it through my guts
You may consider me nuts
But i dare to swear
That i`ll be there
Meeting in paradise
Life would be fair
Following you to hell
Shows you how much i care
Please, end your life
I know we will survive
Use the same knife
So love can bring us alive
