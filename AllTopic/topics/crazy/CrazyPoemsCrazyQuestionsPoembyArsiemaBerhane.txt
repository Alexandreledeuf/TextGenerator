Have you ever
Stood for one moment
Stopped everything
And gave a thought
About today?
Have you ever
For one minute
Stopped  everything
And looked round you
And appreciated the view?
Have you ever
For an instant
Stopped everything
And felt bright
That you are part of this planet?
Have you ever
For a second
Stopped everything you do
And felt proud
Cus you are you?
Have you ever
For a trice
Stopped everything you do
And thought about
The people around and
Figured what a helleven hell
It would have been
If they were not around you?
Have you?
Have you?
May be 'yes'
May be 'no'
May be 'I don't care'
May be 'I donâ€™t know'.
