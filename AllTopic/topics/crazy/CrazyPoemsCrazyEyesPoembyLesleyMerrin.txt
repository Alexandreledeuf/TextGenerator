I wrote this poem when a girl at my school got beaten up by other girls after daring to go for a night out to another village near her own.
I left the house looking for fun
My mum shouted out 'Don't be long.'
I'd suffered before,
Echoes in my head:
'You don't belong! ! you don't belong.! ! '
Love and Hate, do they equate?
I sat on the form, doing the norm:
drinking cider and beer,
unleashing the fear.
Love and Hate, Love and Hate.
Then they arrived, full of pride,
Crazy eyes,
Chanting ' You don't belong! ! you don't belong! ! '
I tried to negate,
I could taste their hate.
'You don't belong, you don't belong.'
The boots went in,
Head started to spin,
'You don't belong, you don't belong.'
When I awoke  mum was there,
Full of despair,
All she said  'I told you don't be long.'
Love and Hate, do they equate?
'Don't be long.' 'You Don't belong.'
