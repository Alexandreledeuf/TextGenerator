I believed you, every word you said
I believed, how stupid I must have been
Didn't my mother tell me that guys always lie
I didn't want to believe it, especially looking into your eyes
the most honest face, who wouldn't trust you
your were like every girls dream come true
We had the makings of something great
but believing in you was just another mistake
I knew it somehow, even in all my doubt
that the guy I knew had not really come out
you were just another guy who lies to get what they want
luckily for me, I woke up
just in time, to correct my mistake
before I made a decision that would make it too late
I could have changed my life for you
rearranged it all
but thankfully I recieved my wake up call
You played with me like the other's, your just about the same
But I'm thankful to you because now I know the game
