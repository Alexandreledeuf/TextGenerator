I spin around with may arms stretched,
Focused on the star lit sky,
Memories of an amazing night etched,
Fresh in my optimistic mind,
Just hoping, preying nothing will go wrong,
Scared of being in my past,
For now just an actress playing right along,
I just wanna wear a mask,
To hide the terror that over takes my bravery,
What if? What if? ? What if? !
Will it happen? Or will I be sold back into slavery?
No? Then here I go off the cliff,
Yes? Then I will have 'died and gone to heaven'
I'll I can do is hope, please?
Will never believe, if ever, until exactly When,
I discover if I have a neurological disease,
Or if this is for real, and I'm not crazy.
