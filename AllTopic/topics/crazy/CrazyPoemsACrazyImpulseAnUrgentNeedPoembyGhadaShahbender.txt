Uncontrollably weeping I reach for my phone
I ring him up and get an out of service tone
I know he's away and that's all I'll hear
But somehow when I call him I feel he's near
I write him a message that he'll never read
I have this crazy impulse, this urgent need
I know its irrational, I know its insane
But it helps me through the day and eases the pain
