What is it that you see, when you
look across your life through the
debris?  Do you see your ideas,
memories and dreams or do you
see what you still could be?
What of the places you once
longed to go or the love you
thought you would now know?
Are you filled with regret in
constant lament or are you still
trying to grow?  When you close
your eyeâ€™s at night in gentle sleep
do you still see me?
