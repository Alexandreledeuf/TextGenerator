I ran up the door, closed the stairs
Said my pajamas, put on my prayers
Turned off my bed and jumped in the light
All because you kissed me goodnight
The Next morning, I woke and scrambled my shoes,
Polished my eggs, and toasted the news,
I couldn't tell my left from my right,
All because you kissed me goodnight
