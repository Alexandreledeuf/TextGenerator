My babe thinks I'm crazy
Crazy for feeling this way
Thinking she's the best thing in the world
Wanting to spend the rest of my life with her
Crazy for looking at her certain ways
Like shes the only one in the room
Crazy for dazing of into her eyes
Or looking at her like shes a goddess
Crazy for loving her so much
Crazy for constantly writing her poems
Crazy for asking her to marry me
My fiance thinks I'm crazy
