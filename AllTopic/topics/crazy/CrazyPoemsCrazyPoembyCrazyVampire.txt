You’ve helped me through rough times
I can’t believe you are mine
But still I can’t get out of my depressed state
I want death to be my fate
You say to stop my pessimistic view of life
You say you want me to be your wife
But I can’t, unless I change
I want to be myself, no more shall I act strange.
