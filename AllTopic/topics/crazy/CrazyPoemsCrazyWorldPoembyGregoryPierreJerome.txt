This world is insane
Now nothing is ever the same
We all playing this vicious game
Of hide and seek without shame
WW3 is about to begin maliciously
As I bleed black fuel
This war game is intelligently cruel
They are nuclear bombing so graciously
the Big-Boss is withdrawing
The underdog is cheering
I tell you people that the world is ending
So get up and run all blaming
This is a chaotic and a crazy world
I conclude in cuffs and chains
As I repent, spin, and twirl
If only the authorities had some brains
The world is upside down
Why are Christians without a sound
While Islam is with a big crown
WW3 is the start of h***
As we burn constantly we all yell
Ring-a-ding I can hear a bell
but we can't hide for we are in a cell
