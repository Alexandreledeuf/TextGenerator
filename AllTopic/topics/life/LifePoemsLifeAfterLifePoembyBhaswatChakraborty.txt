'Moner manush aslo kachhe
Tare dhorline tui jadaye....'
You didn’t embrace the beloved
Who came in your warm reach
To meet you many storms he braved
But why did your heart breach?
He came to illumine you
In the abyss of murky dark
What your mind went through
To push him away so stark?
Life after life he seeks your heart
Deeper and deeper he lands
Only the “Lover” knows him smart
For millennia long he stands
