One life to live one life to love
Cherish the good disregard the bad
Good or bad, take it as a learning experience and move on in life
Both the experience has to be shielded and accepted as souvenir
Utilize bad experiences to improve today
Treasure good experiences for better tomorrow
And escort the life with confidence, honesty and pride
One life to live one life to love
Cherish the good disregard the bad
Happiness or Sorrow either cannot be borrowed
Life is incomplete without each other and both cannot be ignored
Both brings you different flavors and taste to life
Happiness keeps you sweet, Sorrow keep you human
Taste the life with varieties and not to be narrowed
One life to live one life to love
Cherish the good disregard the bad
Life is wonderful gift bestowed by god and honored by nature
Has to be respected and believed by every human and creature
Everyoneâ€™s role are defined and are here with the purpose, decided by creator
Educate the life on the laws of god and the laws of nature
Imbibe these laws of life by choosing god and nature as a tutor
In no way, one should violate the laws made by god and nature, rather then desiring to be a pauper
One life to live one life to love
Cherish the good disregard the bad
Live life with honesty, with purpose, with determination and pride
Live life with Joy, with happiness, with good values and principles
Live life to the fullest but within the laws of the god and the nature
Your existence should be respected and honored for all the good work you render or did for self, family, friends & for the rest of the world during your tenure and the stay on this earth in this life.
Your exit should be without any guilt and you should die with peace, smile and satisfaction.
No one can outturn their destiny
Think good, Do good and Be good, rest live it up to the god to decide
One life to live one life to love
Cherish the good disregard the bad
