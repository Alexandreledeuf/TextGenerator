In a round way of life
what does a man need?
a woman to be call a wife?
or a plot to grow some whets?
just lie down in the night
with your eyes gaze at the light
knowing nothing could be done with your might
and ask yourself is that all to life
some think  life is all about making wealth
or having a family with good health
they gain all they thought but is like joy as melt
still the same life is to be felt
they try to seek for other solutions
but it becomes a greater situation
is like life is a place without salvation
that is the a place call the world
now let talk about my place call the word
u don't need to be in the dark nights
where satisfactions have great might
because you have come to the light
just believe in Jesus and shine so bright
