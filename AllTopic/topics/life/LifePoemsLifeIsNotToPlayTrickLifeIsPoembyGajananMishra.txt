Life is not to play trick,
Life is to make friendship
With truth and love.
Life is to smile with love,
Life is not to fight with others
Life is not to stop but to
Go ahead on the path of progress.
Life is going on a zigzag way
We are here to honor the life
With every little quiver.
Life is to make merry,
Life is to bring all kinds of happiness,
Life is to do every little things
To achieve big dreams in sun-streams.
