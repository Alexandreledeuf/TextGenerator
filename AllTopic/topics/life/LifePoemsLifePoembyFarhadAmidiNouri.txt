Where there is life there is love
Where there is love there is life
Life and love are like pigeon and dove
Love and life are like husband and wife A child when born
Can not survive on his own
Has to be nourished
Has to be nursed
Has to be wrought up
Has to be brought up
This has to be done
For human race to go on
Only love sees this through
Those who fail to offer fall through Life is about nature
We are all part of its pasture
The pasture is too precious and beautiful
To be destroyed by a handful We should all strive
For joyful life
We must all unite
For peace and happiness to ignite
