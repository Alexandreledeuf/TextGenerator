Being released from the womb of a woman
We walk towards another
To be chained again
None is dependable
None is lovable
Life is a coplex road
Walls, stones, mud, water...
Life is a groaning running through
Graveyards
Free, imprisioned
Imprisioned, free
Only a desire weeping alone in solitude
Life is just like life with no comparison
