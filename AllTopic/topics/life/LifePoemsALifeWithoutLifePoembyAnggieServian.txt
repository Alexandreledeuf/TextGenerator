A life, a journey
without passion and affection
emptiness inside
gloominess outside
dreams fly away
reality is a blur
A life, a journey
without passion and affection
lying outside
dying inside
holding on to a belief
nothing but a dust
A life, a journey
without passion and affection
time passed by
nothing gained everything lost
