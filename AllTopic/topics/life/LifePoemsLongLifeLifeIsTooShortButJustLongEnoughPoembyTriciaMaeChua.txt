Life is too short to be spent
griping about the past,
things you don't have,
places you haven't seen,
things you haven't done.
Life is too short to be spent
holding grievances against another,
finding fault in your brother,
counting the wrongs done on you.
Life is just long enough
to enjoy the beauty of a sunrise
the smell of wet earth
and the sound of laughter
after a long day's work.
Life is just long enough
to practice compassion and generosity,
to comfort the grieving,
to lend strength to the fainthearted,
and direction to the lost.
