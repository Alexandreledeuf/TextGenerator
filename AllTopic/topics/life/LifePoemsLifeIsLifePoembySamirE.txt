Life is life, even though it’s tough,
You gotta live with it, even though it’s rough.
It’s a gift, given to us from up above,
So don’t use it for hatred, but use it for love.
Life is the most precious, and valuable gift of all,
So don’t throw it away, by jumping of a wall.
I know it myself, life can be hard,
So if your looking for help, just speak to God.
Life’s of too great value to be thrown away,
So thank God for letting you live – every, single day.
It doesn’t matter if you’re a boy or a girl,
No matter how you kill yourself, you’ve got a date with Lucifer.
You never know when your life will come to an end,
So live your life happily, get a family, and a best friend.
Would you rather have lovely granddaughters, and grandsons? ,
Or kill yourself now, and burn in hell when Dooms day comes.
Live everyday as if it would be your last,
Be kind, happy, and have a blast.
Life is life
