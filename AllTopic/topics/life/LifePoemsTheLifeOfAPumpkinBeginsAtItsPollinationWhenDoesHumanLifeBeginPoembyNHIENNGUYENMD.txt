Now, the spring season is almost over.
My Asian pear trees are loaded with green baby fruits.
Tulip garden already closed its season.
In my lush garden, mustard greens bolster flowers.
Many butterflies and bees convene here.
Koi fish joyfully swim under dawning light.
Red Knockout roses bloom around my Koi pond.
Under blue sky and silver clouds, breezes softly touch rose petals.
A metal fence sits at the end of a nearby tennis court.
Horizontally on this fence, a long pumpkin vine crawls
Under blue sky and on white fence, yellow pumpkin flowers bloom.
I sip a cup of coffee with its rising smoke of sweet aroma
While I carefully spread pollen with q-tip in my other hand.
In place of insects, I pollinate the pumpkin flower.
Just in few days, a new pumpkin will grow to fit my folded palm.
I know for sure, by pollinating the female flower with pollen,
The life of this new pumpkin begins at this very moment.

Above poem is the translation poem of the Vietnamese poem of NHIEN NGUYEN MD:
CUỘC ĐỜI TRÁI BÍ BẮT ĐẦU KHI THỤ PHẤN, KHI NÀO ĐỜI NGƯỜI BẮT ĐẦU?
Bây giờ sắp hết mùa Xuân
Hàng lê tầu đã đầy cành trái non.
Vườn hoa tulip tàn rồi
Vườn rau xanh mướt, cải ngồng trổ bông.
Rộn ràng ong bướm về đông
Bình minh nắng mới, Koi bơi rộn ràng.
Quanh hồ, hồng đỏ Knockout
Trời xanh, mây trắng, gió lay cánh mềm.
Rào sân tennis gần bên
Một giây bí đỏ leo trên rào này.
Trời xanh, rào trắng, bông vàng
Sương đêm lóng lánh bông vàng, lá xanh.
Cà phê thơm khói, uống dần
Tay kia Q-tip phấn vàng nhẹ thoa
Tôi làm ông mối, bà mai
Chờ vài ngày nữa, bí vừa lòng tay.
Nhụy hoa đực cái giao nhau
Cuội đời trái bí bắt đầu từ đây.
