nature and our planet
are special sacred holy
the life blood of all earth life...
when nature struggles humanity
struggles
when nature dies
humanity dies...
already industrial pollutants
diminish life quality
global warming super cell
unleashes disasters...
catastrophic Arctic ice melts
slow global
ocean currents
sea levels...
rising inundate coastal agriculture
eighty percent
of earth's mega cities
are sentenced will...
be swallowed under salt seas
rewriting destinies of countries
changing the shape of continents
swallowing low lying islands...
eating once familiar coastlines of the world
