In the tranquility of hope
And divinity of love that
Binds us to feel the inner self
Churns the butterfly moments
Though we met umpteen of times
We drown to search, what we lost
Found the new us in every sight
Mystical the experiences, at different levels
Felt the warmth of your companionship
In every breath....
Though let down by the one
Whom you trust...
Fall in love, long for the real one
Love is life, life is love...
