Store up for a while
What things you might need
Just for few weeks
No more you see
We've lived with the sins
Of greed and lust
We don't need anymore
To be blamed on us
Just do it slow
That way from where it might flow
It might be here faster
For others you know.
Some planted early
It won't be too long
So just the staples
In case something goes wrong
And point out the toxins
Planted in the way
So others can see them
As they pass here today
Just point them out
As you pass by
No false accurasations
For our goal is High
The Lord's Prayer
Our Father Which art in heaven
Hallowed be Thy Name
Thy Kingdom come
THY WILL BE DONE
On earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day our daily Bread
And forgive us our sins
For we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For Thine is the Kingdom and the power and the glory
Forever.  Amen.
