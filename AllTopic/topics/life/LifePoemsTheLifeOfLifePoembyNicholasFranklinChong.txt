Don't remember,
Still can't recall,
The fusion of gametes.
The beginning of,
A unique life form,
The creation of me.
Nestled in the womb,
Secured in the sac,
The nature of oblivion.
The precious first,
Inhalation of air,
The birth of me.
Senses overloaded,
Functions overdrive,
The unfolding of truth.
I crawl I walk,
I ride the tricycle,
The cycle of life.
Peculiar surroundings,
Familiar voices,
The currency of love.
Aspire Inspire,
Abstract piece of art,
The decor of personality.
Challenges unfold,
Confusions aplenty,
The march of faithful soldier.
All in One,
One in All,
The One of Infinity.
A spark in the heart,
A gleam in the eye,
The roar of the calling.
Craving to give,
Forgetting to take,
The charity of love.
Move forth run swift,
Rise up fly high,
The vastness of space.
To chuckle to laugh,
To sob to wail,
The subjectivity of time.
From ashes to ashes,
From dust to dust,
The dimensions of existence.
Let there be love,
Let there be light,
The recipe of germination.
