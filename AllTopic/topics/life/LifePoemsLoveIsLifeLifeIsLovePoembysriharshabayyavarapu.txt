The question'what is love' has grown from the stage of seed into a plant, in me...
Its heading towards a huge tree,
I couldn't bare it any longer....
So, I started brooding over it,
but i have no answer....
So started getting answer from people
around me...
Mom answered'love strengthens every relation'....
But my dad replied'it energies a person'....
A newly wedded couple told
Its understanding of souls.....
Expecting my friend's answer would match with one of above replies.....
But it did not, he said LOVE is
a relation wit no end point.....
But for a passionate lover
LOVE is above all....
For my grand mother
LOVE is happiness...
But for younger cousin
LOVE is his CRUSH....
I m deeply worried.none of d above replies matchedddd.........
After a great disappointment, a clarity overcame my frustrations......
I, then realised,
LOVE IS LIFE
LIFE IS LOVE..........there is love at every part of our life..................
we just need to feel it......
