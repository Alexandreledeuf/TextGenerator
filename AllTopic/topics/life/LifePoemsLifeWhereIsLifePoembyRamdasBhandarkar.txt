Life is always light
for some
Life is always fight
for some,
Life is full of light
For some
Life is without light for some,
Life is search for light,
Some live a long life,
Some live for a short,
Some live for a purpose,
some live for themselves,
Some live for others,
Some are good thinkers,
Some are  fantastic,
Some live in fantasies,
Some are short sighted,
And live a life, full of fight,
Some or long sighted,
And always tumble or stumble!
Some are great by birth,
Some are great by thoughts,
Some are great by deeds,
some are really great,
and they have the vission,
They have the strength and will,
they look as a lake still,
Yet they are full of life,
They always smile
And keep worries way a mile!
some has ways open, some has to open them on own,
Some Wander where life takes,
Some take life where they want,
Some are really great
Those realise, if not there is either birth or death,
Who is there to say what is life?
