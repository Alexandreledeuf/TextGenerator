Everyone's life
Everyone's life's really tragic it seems,
There's just not time friend to live all our dreams.
While you may try to keep stiff upper lip,
Gravity's plotting to just sink your ship!
Wonder why some people's face sports a frown?
Most of our trains never get out of town
Yes, there are those with bright lives that seem charmed
(Living in fenced fear, their houses alarmed!)
Our fullest flower's the fruit of all breath
Blossoms revealed as harbinger of death
Our seed the key to mortality's curse
Our blood the oil for humanity's hearse.
Einstein's reality always a lie*
Truth(s)     we are seeking in quite short supply
Death is an area most think is real
Candidate surely for concept puerile!
When we are sure that the opposite's true
Death's unreality comes into view!
Credible evidence that soul exists.
Vanity skewered by what it resists.
Poetry can't prove that man's soul is real,
Satan's best plot not a single soul steal,
Your darkest moment when love hides its face
God's possibility blows up the place!
