a life gone by.....suspectedly self sustaining
it ignited self.....self immolating
courageously it pass itself by..............
its another life....time.....
it is now ethereal,
it is now ephemeral
it is now euphoric
life after life, a span of a rainbow,
its a, , , shipwreck of a life time,
we are gona swim out, , , , riding on the sea waves,
waves lashed high and might...........rocked the ship
surf the same waves, , , , , , current under our feet.......buoyant
swim ashore..........wonderland.........
this is my Utopia...............my after life........another........time...
