I dont know the purpose of my life
I am a giant, i am carrying the earth on my back
I fighted in my battles and never be beaten
Rabid winds got on my frozen body
Bad people, people talked to me lies
Beautyful women, eroticly, lustily kissed me
All of them thiefs of a scene of the film of my life
All of them something wanna get of me
I dont know the purpose of my life
But i know when this time will come
When the purpose, ethical or not
I will understand, i will conquer, i will succeed
A breeze will make me fall, with no purpose
