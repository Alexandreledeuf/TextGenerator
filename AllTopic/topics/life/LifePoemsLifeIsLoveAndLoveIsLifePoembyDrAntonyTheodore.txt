This expression that
life is love and love is life
is very ancient
pronounced by ancient seers.
But we have lost contact
with this love in the modern age.
Our distractions like
sexual attraction,
running after money,
unstable emotions,
religious dogmas,
are very strong in us
having strange roots.
Return to our true nature
in the experience
of the true spirit.
