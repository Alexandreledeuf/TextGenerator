So my question to you is simple and yet sharp as a knife,
Are you living a life of death or the death of your life?
Is death coming suddenly, or are you just wasting away?
Which of these morose questions holds the truth I cannot say,
With one hand you're watching your life decay,
On the other you're waiting for your last day,
Whichever of these statements you feel is true,
The end of your life is all it comes down to.
