Life is after all life
Whether you lead peacefully or with full of strife
It has to be spent either way
Casual or with noble and purposeful way
Life can never have different yardstick
Even birds have understood when they speak
Arrival of their new born in the nest
As if to celebrate it with fun and live at best
How nice they take care of new born?
Even rich or poor also enjoy same way even if life is fully torn
It is natural and almighty has given
The same sense of feeling and interwoven
Let us not enlarge area of operation
As it gives rise then to deterioration
If one can't look after its own affair at home
How can he withstand outside pressure and welcome
I picked the sense of birds and evaluated
How peaceful was their life and nicely related?
To build nest in time and take full care
Even to face the presence when some one goes near or dares
In blind quest we sometimes sacrifice real happiness
That may make him restless and not shown on face
If life is given for peaceful living and with purpose
It must be made amply clear and must be chosen
Let is build high rise buildings or make living in space
It has to be made with sense barring the mad race
After all it is for our living and that must be borne in mind
Love, affection, relation are all for us not to go blind
