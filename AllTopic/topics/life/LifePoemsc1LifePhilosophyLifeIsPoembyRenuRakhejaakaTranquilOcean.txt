It has neither a beginning nor an end
You can never predict where it will bend.
Life is a teacher, it will show you the way
But unless you live it...it will run away.
If you have no fear of living, you will find
No fear of death and you will not mind.
You have to feel the agonizing sorrow and feel the pain
Only then it will heal and you will be whole again.
It is in every leaf, in your smile, in your tears
In your toil, in your triumphs and in your fears.
Just enjoy the journey without looking back
Savour the senses and you will not lack.
Truth is more in the process than the result
Liberates you from thought and you can exult
To see the truth in the false, thats the key
To understand, without changing it...just let it be
Love life, live it and it will set you free....
