Life had come into my life
And furtively, had taken away
The luminous stars from my eyes,
And the imagination of my mind,
The innocent dreams of my heart
And threw them away, with all my hope,
In a deserted terrain of my being;
And I found myself bereft of my being:
In the repetitive circle of routine,
In a vapid mundane reality
That deprives me of my existence;
Saturating itself at the core of whatever
Might have become of my life.
