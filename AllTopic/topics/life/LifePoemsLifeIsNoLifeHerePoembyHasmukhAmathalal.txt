Life is no life
Tuesday,12th March 2019
I feel no different
when present
about Almighty's (Allah's)world
something new unfolds
it comes out in the form of verses
and I make no miss
look at the stars in the sky
and weave it nicely with an earnest try
I am always thankful
for making me faithful
to the cause of poetry
and sing it or present it wonderfully
I see it as an opportunity
to sing and praise His name in the name of humanity
to grant us blessings
and make us well human beings
I shall continue to sing
and try to bring
the good name for mankind
and always find the place in their heart
life is no life
if we run away from the torn strife
I shall remain among poor
and never harbor an ill wish for the neighbor
