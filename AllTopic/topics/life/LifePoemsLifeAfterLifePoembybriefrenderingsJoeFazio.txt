They took your mortal remains and placed
them gently beneath a flowered covered grave.
Time and again I returned there...begging you
to speak once more. I would speak to you from
sunrise, until a howling wolf could be heard
in the black of night. Each time I left...blinded
by tears and pained by anguish.
This night, as I approached our home...
silhouetted against a hazy moon, I stopped.
There on the wooded path, stood a deer
..seemingly frozen in the soft moonlight.
Its eyes locked with mine. Not a sound broke
the stillness as we both stood motionless.
Slowly...the blanket of night wrapped me in
a peaceful feeling.
Almost involuntary, a soft gentle voice broke
the eerie night...as I spoke to the deer.
'No...it can not be. Is it you?
The deer moved not... as it continued to stare back
in my direction. A voice... in the deepest part of
my being...spoke a muted response.
'Yes...it is I. I have not died.
I am now a part of all that is His.
I am the deer. I am the flower...and
the dew on the grass.
I am the single ray of sunshine, that jets
though a slate gray sky.
I am a childs tears, a mothers joy and a fathers pride.
I am the roar of the ocean...the power of the sea
and the love in your heart.
I am the sounds in the night that you can
not see...but always hear.
I am the music of the stars and the voice
of the angels.
I am the eagle that soars and the white
on a snow capped mountain.
I am the air that you breath and the
memories so dear.
I am the spirit of peace and I am the
spirit of hope.
I am all these things...and more.
I am love. I did not die.'
Tears streamed down my face...as the deer moved
toward me. Now inches from me...the eyes filled
with love...the voice within me, spoke once again...
'I am love...Love does not die...I did not die.'
The deer, brushed gently past me and moved
slowly...silently...disappearing into the woods.
And...now I know.
'Some of us die...Some of us do not.'
