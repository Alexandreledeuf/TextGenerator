Life is a dream to some.
Drifting without a goal.
Life is a tragedy to others,
Without knowledge of the soul.
Life can be what you make it.
With courage undaunted and strong.
If you try to do the best you can.
Instead of just drifting along.
Life is earnest, Life is demanding,
When we live by Universal Law.
For the laws are unfailing and true,
For the flawless action we feel awe.
Universal Law was in the beginning,
And will last for ever more.
When we live by these Laws
Life will cease to be a chore.
So live a life of one who knows,
That unseen Laws govern all.
Then your life will run smoothly,
There will never be a fall.
