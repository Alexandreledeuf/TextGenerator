★This Life This Life I Cannot Leave You Again
☆Luo Zhihai Lyrics and Translation
Where did your form appear?
On the golden seawall shone sunlight.
Carrying a packsack and seeking for you.
We were interesting to enjoy sunset and tide.
Rain poured down and wind raged.
Waves turned up and down and thunders from the sky.
Sailing side by side I snuggled with you.
Until pushing clouds and bringing to light.
Where did your steps climb and cross?
Jungle faint and mountain paths wound
By your gun, a wild boar was shot.
I caught up seeing that with my eyes.
Forest over the thorns and moss.
Wore enough clothes and opened your big eyes.
Listened to birds singing saying goodbye.
We were out of the jungle back to life.
Looking for your footprints with my dream.
Write our love in diaries at night.
Singing with karaoke and MP4.
Make love together in happy time.
Enjoy games and dancing every day.
Good mood, beautiful scene every day.
No matter where you go long distances.
This life this life I cannot leave you again.

★今生今世我再也离不开你
☆罗志海歌词
你的身 影出现在哪里？
阳光照耀金色的海堤
背上行襄兴冲冲寻找你
我们饶有趣味赏落日潮汐
天有不测风云飘泼大雨
海浪滔天翻滾雷打电劈
肩并肩扬帆我偎依着你
直到拨 开乌云重见天日
你的步履跋涉到哪里？
丛林幽幽山路崎岖里
一只野猪撞上你 枪底
我匆匆赶上尽收眼里
林中遍布苔藓和荆棘
请穿够衣服小心脚底
听小鸟婉 转歌唱嘀哩哩
我们走出丛林重现生机
带上梦想我追寻你足迹
你情我爱通通写 进日记
一起唱卡拉OK听MP4
一起作爱我们一起happy
天天跳呀舞呀尽情游戏
天天好心情精彩又靓丽
不管你长途跋涉要去哪里
今生今世我再也离不开你
