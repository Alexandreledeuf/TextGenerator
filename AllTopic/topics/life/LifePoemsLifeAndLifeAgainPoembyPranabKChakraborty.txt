Death no wonder
its endless inferiority
known to us all
wonder is life
because we yet not know
the possibilities
yet to be exposed
death now simply a station
where a stop will blot a presence
but life shows fights
colorful its ignition
Wonder
wonderful
ambitious much to get
thousand times to taste life
infinite and endless...
