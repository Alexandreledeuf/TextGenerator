He was given a life
A life devoid of life
He lives just to live
He breathes just to live.
A life anchored to pain
Suffering and total disdain
A life born into poverty
And stays in poverty
Is he in hell or purgatory?
Is he born just to die?
Who will free him
From this bondage
Of total nothingness?
He glimpsed at the horizon
He saw a dying moon
Dark clouds like cobra
Ready to snap his life.
Is he born just to die?
If this is his fate
I hope he will inherit
The Kingdom of God.
