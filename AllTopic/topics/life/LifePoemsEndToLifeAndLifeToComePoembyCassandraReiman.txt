Thunderous mountains brought forth from slumber.
Clashing on air in the midnight mists of souls
Spiral to the depths of the earth
Seek the mother to grasp the answers
Instill she has the questions pondered
Never ending whispers amongst the winds
Embraced by the musical tenors of every season
Fiery skies rape the sleeping beauty
All is in a tither, patiently awaiting solace
Come it will, when the heavens divide the earth
Maker of life shield the eyes of the innocents
Twisted agony ceases this day
Exodus has come
No more worship to life
