When love resides in heart
The head makes body to dance
Life enjoys moments
Tic tac tic toe tic tac
Sharing and caring reaches at peak
Flower bloom, bird sings,
Music notes flows everywhere
Tic tac tic toe tic tac
The beauty of this life
Dances in tiny things
Wearing the shawl of happiness
Tic tac tic toe tic tac
