You are beautiful,
You give birth to my soul,
You blossom me wealth,
You nurture me health,
You may make me cry,
I may wish you inexistence,
But at my last sigh,
You grant me resistance.
I know that I'm not your only,
But do you know, that this, makes me feel lonely?
I know that millions depend on you,
But to still love you, do you know what I had to go through?
You roam the earth in salience,
You wonder with your grace,
But  why must you bring abhorrence
Resent and loath on to our face?
I for one, have it mutilated
By your hands created and now decimated;
My eyes bleed at your sight
And die at your upcoming light;
O LIFE, O LIFE, O LIFE
CAN YOU PLEASE END MY STRIFE? !
