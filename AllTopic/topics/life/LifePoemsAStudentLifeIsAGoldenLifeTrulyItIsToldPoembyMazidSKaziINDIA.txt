A student life is a golden life, truly it is told.
The student who has a golden crown of his study.
Would be a great man in his life with a great hold.
Otherwise an idle student becomes a wild rowdy.
Every student should use his time in a proper way.
If he kills his time, surely time itself always kills him.
such student repents in life every moment of a day.
A studen must think that his time is a  golden rim.
To be a Dr.an engineer, a lawyer or a politician.
Time makes him all for all to become more of thing.
Golden time of a golden life even makes a muscian.
One who neglects this period of life becomes nothing.
This period has a great charm to make also a magician.
A life is in the hands of a student to make him something.
