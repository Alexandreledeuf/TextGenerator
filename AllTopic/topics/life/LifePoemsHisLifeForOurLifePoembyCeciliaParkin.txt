I keep the Cross before my eyes
And know the sacrifice He made.
His life for mine, His life for ALL
Is what his dieing  did that day.
I hear the shouts and feel the pain
As He trudged His destined way.
Scourged, deserted, denied, betrayed,
Soon-His death became- -
The heavons exploaded, the lightened raged,
His followers bewildered lay.
All hope was lost, Nothing remained! .
Then came the Glorious Easter Day! .
