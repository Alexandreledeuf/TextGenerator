Consider escaping the Puerto Rican sun by exploring the Río Camuy Cave Park, the third largest subterranean river system in the world. Along with guided tours of the caves—some big enough to engulf skyscrapers—you can rappel 200 feet, crawl through muddy passages, swim through an underground river, or see cave paintings and carvings by the island's original Taino Indians.
