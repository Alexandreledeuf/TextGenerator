The Singapore Night Safari take you through stretches of forest at the Singapore zoo where you can see nocturnal animals roaming about in the natural habitat. there are bearded pigs, sang kancil, hipopotamus, deers, tigers and lions. of course, the animals that could cause the most disturbance here are those with flashes and cameras. they had to be told repeatedly not to use flashes as that could cause the animals to become unruly, and heading for the flash.
