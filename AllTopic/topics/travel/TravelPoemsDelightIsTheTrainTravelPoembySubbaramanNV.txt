Confined he was to the greenwood tree
Sky was the roof of his home rent free
To move about was not his spree
Quest for moving yearning for a key!
Planets move along the fixed orbit
Sun and moon seem to move with grit
Birds and animals walk on earth quite fit
Skylark flies and floats well in the air
Duck and swan walk on earth
Swim in water free with mirth
Motivating the men to try
To swim in water and fly in the sky!
Ancient ones walked from place to place
Later learnt to move on horse's back with grace
Trees and plants stand and grow quite trim
Birds and all walk, fly or swim
Some walk and fly, few walk and swim
Man alone learnt all the three to the brim!
Cart and car on road
Train and tram on the track
Boat and ship on water
Copter and plane in air!
Quietly sit in the running train
Nicely see the moving trees!
Deceptive vision swept in the world
Creative mind captive in its fold!
Fly in the air amidst clouds alone
Go in the ship amidst water alone
Delight it is travel in a train
Twilight travel removes all your strain!
Enjoy the journey really fine
Life's journey full of pain and gain!
Dizzy hills and lovely dales
Tall trees and fertile fields
Dense forests and delightful deserts
Coconut groves and mango gardens
Mosque domes and temple towers
Church towers- a treat of showers!
Red rays of the rising sun
Golden rays of the dying sun!
Moving cars in the parallel tracks
Waving hands of the rural folks!
Outside the train all such treats
Inside the coach sure much sweets!
Young and old, fit and the sick
Men and women, poor and the rich
Slow and lazy, swift and the quick
Confluence of all with a goal
Goal of reaching their home!
Display of human frivolities
Gaining entry into the crowded coach
Blocking latter, closing the approach!
Selfish to the core from the days of yore
Giving less and taking more!
Good Samaritans surely found
Spreading cheers all around!
Sleeping well to the lullaby of the train
Reading full to fill the gap in the brain
Eating, munching kept in store
Vendors providing more and more
Talking topics all under the sun
Giving chance of reply sure to none!
Delight indeed is a train travel
Grand indeed is the modern marvel!
