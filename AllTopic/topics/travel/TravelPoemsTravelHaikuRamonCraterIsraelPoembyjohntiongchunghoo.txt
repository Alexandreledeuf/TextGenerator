Ramon Crater arrival
our overflowing sweat and beer
as we toast each other
Covering over 55 percent of the country's territory, the Negev Desert was once largely overlooked as a travel destination in Israel. Now, using the city of Be'er Sheva as a base for excursions, adventurous travelers can brave the unforgiving temps and discover places like Mitzpeh Ramon, a small town bordering Makhtesh Ramon (Ramon Crater) , the largest natural crater in the world.
