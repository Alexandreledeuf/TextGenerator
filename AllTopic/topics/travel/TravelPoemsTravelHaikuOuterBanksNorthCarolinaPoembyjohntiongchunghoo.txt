Outer Banks
miles and miles and miles
of the Atlantic
Outer Banks
as we walk and talk, the Atlantic
stretches and roars
Outer Banks
accompanying us - the Atlantic
creation song
Lining the North Carolina coast, the Outer Banks consists of barriers of sand 130 miles long and never more than a few miles wide. These islands serve as welcome mats to the Atlantic and all her treasures. Forage the sea for a bounty of bill fish, wahoo, and mahi mahi, or walk the wild dunes, a naturalist's playground. Close to 400 species of birds, from native Carolina wrens to wintering bald eagles, can be found here, along with otters and sea turtle colonies. Add four lighthouses and you have yourself a seaworthy destination that even a pirate like Blackbeard (a former resident)could call home.
