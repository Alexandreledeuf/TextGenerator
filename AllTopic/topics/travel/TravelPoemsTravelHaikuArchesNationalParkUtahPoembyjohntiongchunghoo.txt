Arches National Park
frozen in their dance
the shapely rocks
Arches National Park
i stretch my hands
to dance with rocks
Arches National Park
inspiring me to dance
rocks of all shapes and sizes
arches national park
nature takes a rest in
a rock dance
Arches National Park
still at their work
the winds
Arches National Park
nature's hands are
in the winds
Arches National Park
i choreograph a
rocky dance
Arches National Park lives up to its name. Its salt bed base—called the "Paradox Foundation"—has resulted in more than 2,000 natural sandstone arches and countless unusual rock formations. This gave Mother Nature a canvas to shape and form the arches, spires, fins, and monoliths.
