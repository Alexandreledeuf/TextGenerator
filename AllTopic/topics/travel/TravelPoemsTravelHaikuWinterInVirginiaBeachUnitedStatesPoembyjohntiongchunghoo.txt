vinginia beach winter
excitement of whales
heats up the air
The weather may be finger-numbingly frigid as you bob in the Atlantic, but winter in Virginia Beach is the ideal time to spot majestic humpback and fin whales during their annual migration from Canada's Bay of Fundy. Both these species are endangered, with the fin whale being the second largest animal on earth after the blue whale. Contact the Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center for information about whale-watching tours.
