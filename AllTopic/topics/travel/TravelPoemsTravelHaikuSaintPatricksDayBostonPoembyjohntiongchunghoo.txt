The first Saint Patrick's Day celebration in the United States was held in 1737 in Boston. As evidence of the city's strong Irish influence and heritage, Beantown's Saint Paddy's Day celebration remains one of the biggest in the country. The partying begins this weekend, so grab a pint at one of the city's many Irish pubs and catch an Irish music performance. Then watch the parade on March 16 in South Boston (better known as Southie) , with marching bands, pipe bands, and step dancers from all over North America.
