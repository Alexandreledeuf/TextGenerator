London's Marylebone
we do a quiet reunion
in the heart of the city
feeling so much closer
my wine old as the town
London's Marylebone
London's Marylebone
time stands still for us
to savour its past
see how a time warp
lifts your spirit to the occasion
London's Marylebone
a city's hideaway
be quiet it's
London's Marylebone
heart of London
well you'll see it, hear it
and taste it in Marylebone
away from the blues
we suggest
London's Marylebone
A city as big as London retains its hidden neighborhood gems. Despite its central location in the heart of the city, the thriving neighborhood of Marylebone doesn't get nearly enough credit for its small village vibe and the escape from bustling London life that it provides. With peaceful Paddington Gardens at the center, and cozy squares and neat row houses throughout, Marylebone is filled with independent cafes, homegrown designer shops, vintage markets, fine foods stores, and updated Victorian pubs.
