Jim Thompson House
the house too
misses its owner
my eyes run up and down
left and right
for jim
Jim Thompson House
it is too waiting for
owner to be back
Jim Thompson House
this emptiness that
the owner will never be back
Jim Thompson House
despite the visitors
the loneness in  the house
jim thompson house visit
a bird's cheerful chirp
all is up and well for him
jim thompson house
that forboding giant tree
right in front of door
