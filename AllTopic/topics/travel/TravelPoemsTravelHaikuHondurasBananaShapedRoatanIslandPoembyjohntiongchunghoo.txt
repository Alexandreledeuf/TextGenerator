Roatan
going bananas
on banana island
roatan island
my cigarrette smoke trails
over the dolphin jumps
roatan island
they told me to enjoy
doing nothing
roatan island
his strokes on the canvas
more breathtaking than waves
Honduras
January 6,2007: Roat√°n, a 40-mile-long banana-shaped island off the Honduran coast, rests in the azure waters of the Caribbean, with some of the world's best scuba diving and snorkeling. But no one will fault you if you decide to laze on one of the island's many pristine beaches and perfect the art of doing nothing at all.
