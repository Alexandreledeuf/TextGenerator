a baby elephant trumpets
the joy of salvation
Botswana's Okavango
elephant's cry
echoes through the plain
Elephant Back Safaris' Abu Camp in Botswana's Okavango Delta, welcomed a new baby elephant named Lorato, which translates to 'love.' Lorato spends her days following her mother, Kitimetse, on her daily mud baths and alongside her wanderings through the 500,000-acre area. Abu Camp researchers are observing Lorato as she develops, collecting data to further their work towards implementing a country-wide elephant conservation program.
