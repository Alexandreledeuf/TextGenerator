Experience Caribbean history in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The capital city's 12-block Zona Colonial boasts the oldest cathedral, hospital, customs house, and university in the Americas. Visit the Alcázar de Colón, the palace built for Christopher Columbus's son Diego and his wife, King Ferdinand of Spain's niece. And at the Museo de las Casas Reales you'll find an array of colonial artifacts including weapons, armor, remnants of an 18th-century Spanish ship, and (allegedly)        some of Columbus's ashes.
