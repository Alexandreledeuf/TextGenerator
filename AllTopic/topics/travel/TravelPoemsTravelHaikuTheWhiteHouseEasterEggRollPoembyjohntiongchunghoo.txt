The White House Easter Egg Roll takes place the Monday after Easter (this year, March 24th)   and continues a tradition President Rutherford B. Hayes began in 1878. Children of all ages hunt for Easter eggs on the White House lawn and enjoy storytelling by authors of popular children's books, athletes, Cabinet members, and other senior administration officials; egg coloring; face painting; music; costumed Easter-themed characters; and magicians.
