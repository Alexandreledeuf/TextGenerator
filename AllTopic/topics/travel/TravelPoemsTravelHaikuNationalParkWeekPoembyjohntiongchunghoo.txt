Earth Day 2008 will present thousands of opportunities for people around the world to put the environment first for a moment, from high-minded calls and concerts agitating for action against global warming, to community-minded eco-events to clean up local watersheds or plant more neighborhood trees. U.S.-based families should also check out the kid-focused National Park Week (April 19-27) , featuring Earth Day-centric events like Yosemite's Earth Dance Film Festival as well as special Junior Ranger Days in places like Kentucky's Mammoth Cave or Maine's Acadia National Park.
