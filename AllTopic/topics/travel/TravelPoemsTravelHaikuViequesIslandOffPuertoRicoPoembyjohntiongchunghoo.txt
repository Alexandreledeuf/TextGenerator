Vieques nirvana
the waves sweeps  back the peace
into my heart
Vieques
in the water
and wishing i have wings
Vieques nirvana
the sea sweeps through
every of my  pores
Vieques nirvana
the sea and sky fuses my mind
and body
Vieques, a small island just a short ferry ride from San Juan, delivers the ideal beach vacation. Even with its picture-perfect scenery and pristine beaches, the island does not draw crowdsâ€”visitors will find that their footprints are often the only ones in the sand. Once the sun sets, head to Island Adventures Biobay Eco-tours for a guided swim in the bioluminescent Mosquito Bay, where every splash and kick will create a silver flash in the dark water
