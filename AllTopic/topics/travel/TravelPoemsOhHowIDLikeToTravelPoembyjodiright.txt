I lie awake each night
Staring at the ceiling
Following each crack
Finding new routes
Oh, how I’d like to travel
Somewhere new,
Somewhere old,
Somewhere where the people;
Sing merrily
Dance happily
Oh, how I’d like to travel
On a plane,
On a boat,
On something that will get me there;
Fast, like a soaring bird
Safely, like a locked room
Oh, how I’d like to travel
To see the sunset of a new horizon
To smell the sweet smells of newness
Like the delicious croissants;
Of France
Like the finest chocolates
Of Belgium
Like the mouth watering tomatoes
Of Spain
To taste each one would full
A delicacy unknown to my taste buds.
Oh, how I’d like to travel
Could be anywhere
It doesn’t have to be far
Because like every crack
It can be long route or,
It can be short route
