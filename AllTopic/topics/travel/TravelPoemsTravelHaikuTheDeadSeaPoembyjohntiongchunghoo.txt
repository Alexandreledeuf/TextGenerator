making me feel
on top of the world
the Dead Sea
lifting me up
to the top of the world
the Dead Sea
rising ala ascension
the ressurection
dead sea wonder
the dead sea
we rise a la the ascension
ressurection
dead sea unscrolls
a new chapter for
Christiandom
Dead Sea
the newspaper and me
float along
Dead Sea
the water lifts us
up to read
Dead Sea
the sun our lamp
the sea our dunllop
Dead Sea
it fends to keep us
afloat
Dead Sea
alive with
great history
Dead Sea
history keeps it
alive
Dead Sea
the scrolls give
Isaias a new voice
Dead Sea
found - scrolls that keep
God's words alive
Dead Sea
a rebirth for Christianity
in the hidden scrolls
Dead Sea
alive enough to lift
us all up
Dead Sea
and he asks
is it actually dead?
his phobia
the pilgrimage of the Dead Sea
cancelled
Reaching 1,373 feet below sea level, the shores of the Dead Sea are the lowest dry point on earth and its water is the second saltiest on the planet. Over the last 50 years, the Dead Sea has lost a third of its surface area to irrigation and hydroelectricity projects, and sinkholes have further siphoned water from the sea into underground caverns, reaching a water level dropp rate of three feet per year in 2006.
