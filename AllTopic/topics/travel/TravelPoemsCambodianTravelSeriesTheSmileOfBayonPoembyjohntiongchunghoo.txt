bayon smiles
from high up
a thousand year old smile
preserved through the ages
in the forests
snarled, overgrown
with shrubs, ferns
to finally emerge and
smile again triumphantly
well, thank god, for the dim years
the forest, has saved you
from marauding thais, champs
burmese, colonialists and world war criminals
bayon, smile, smile and smile to the world
from all the  angles.
