Saigon War Museum
burnt hole ridden children clothes
my heart too in tatters
At the War Museum, there were exhibits of clothes of prisoners and even those of children killed in the Vietnamese War. I remember when I went to visit the Killing Field in Cambodia, there were also exhibits of torn clothes right below the monument where they exhibit the skulls of those killed in the war. They really put my heart in tatters.
