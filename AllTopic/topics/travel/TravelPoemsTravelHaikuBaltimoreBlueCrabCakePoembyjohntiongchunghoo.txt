Charm City
traffic to crab cake market
slows to a crawl
lightly and surely
it fires up my tastebuds
Baltimore's crab cake
Baltimore blue crab cake
light and springy
a baseball in action
When in Charm City, be sure to taste the award-winning Baltimore crab cakes at local favorite Lexington Market. About the size of a baseball and made of only the most tender crabmeat found in Maryland blue crabs, they are crafted by hand so as not to crush the large, juicy lumps. And—though the original recipe remains hush-hush—we know that crushed saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs help keep the cakes light and fluffy.
