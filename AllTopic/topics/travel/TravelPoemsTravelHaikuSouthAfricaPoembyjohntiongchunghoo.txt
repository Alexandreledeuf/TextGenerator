Cape Town
as drunken and lost
as ancient seafarers
South Africa
South Africa has 14 traversable wine routes and over 2,000 varieties of wine. While most visitors venture out to the wine country on day trips from Cape Town, you can spend many heady weeks tasting your way through the Cape, a jaunt made all the easier by outfitters available that specialize in the wines of South Africa.
