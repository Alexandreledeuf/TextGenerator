antarctic excursion
the new split edge of
a glacier
antartic excursion
a glacier coldly
passes us by
antarctic excursion
they tell us how  to bring
the heat down
antarctic excursion
the air warms up
to our arrival
antarctic excursion
taking a cold look at
a breakaway glacier
antarctic excursion
a glacier coldly floats
by our boat
sinister as a wolf
the glacier that floats
by our boat!
With all the hype over global warming and the loss of the world's glaciers, Antarctica has become an increasingly popular travel destination. Witness the icy continent's captivating natural wonders while you can, but do your part to protect the environment from further damage. Take a cruise with outfitters such as Natural Habitat Adventures, who now offer carbon-neutral expeditions, or Peregrine Adventures, who follow strict guidelines for environmentally sound tourism.
