Pyromaniacs unite! Las Fallas, the biggest festival in Valencia, Spain, attracts two million revelers to the city from March 15 to 19 to set things ablaze. Local communities create 20-foot-tall effigies of politicians, film, and sports celebrities, and even bullfighters—anyone of national or international notoriety—only to set them on fire during this quirky festival. Another highlight is the daily mascleta, a competition for the biggest, loudest, and flashiest fireworks display.
