Pink Sand Beach yoga
on and on I chant with the sea
seeking nirvana
Pink Sand Beach yoga
on and on i chant with the sea
seeking peace in the mind
Pink Sand Beach yoga
on and on I chant with the sea
to calm the tempest in my mind
Pink Sand Beach yoga
between the pink sand and
the blue sea, my nirvana
Pink Sand Beach yoga
on and on the sea chants too
seeking nirvana
Pink Sand Beach yoga
i sat on a pink lotus looking to
the horizon longing nirvana
Why settle for white sand when you can have a little color? Several places in the Caribbean have pink beaches, but the most iconic is on Harbour Island. The strawberry ice cream color comes from shells of microscopic marine organisms. The aptly-named Pink Sand Beach stretches most of the island's three-mile eastern shore, where sunrises are spectacular and an offshore coral reef tempers the surf.
