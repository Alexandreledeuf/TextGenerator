so much more interesting
but never exhibited - how
the ancient master crafted
from ivory the size of half your thumb
a boat that seats several persons
and on it a poem words smaller
than your pores
haiku
incredibly preserved
incredible cotton fine
centuries old ivory carving

cotton fine ivory carvings
i strain my eyes to see
how well the faces are
At the Palace Museum in Taipei are several wonders one could see.
One of these are  the unimaginable intricate  ivory carvings that make one wonder how ancient craftsmen could craft a Chinese poem with a hundred words on a space not larger than a square inch. Also
men and women the size of a few rice grains with intricate facial expressions. This writer does not encourage ivory carvings though.
