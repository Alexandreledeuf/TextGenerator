I travel far and wide
throughout the world to
sun lazily in aqua pools in Greece,
picnic by the the Eiffel Tower,
stroll white sand beaches on tropic isles,
fly over glacier packed mountaintops
green countrysides and floral valleys.
In an instant I am transported to
exotic faraway landscapes
without ever leaving my own chair,
my soul free to experience things
it never can otherwise.
Truly an amazing gift....
being a part of the beauty of the world
through the eyes and lens of others
right here on my computer screen.
