Another Tale of the Vicar Dodgy Dave
and how he finally caught a soul to save
You see he has this friend named Feathers
And Feathers won't be found at a sermon in any kind of weather
But Dodgy Dave the Vicar was up to his old tricks
He caught Feathers on a double quick
While Feathers was talking to some friends outside the church
The Vicar rolled his pulpit outside with a lurch
Handed Feathers one of the hymnal books
Then asked to commence without a look
Feathers looked around and said 'I hope no one has a camera here'
for capturing this milestone event was his fear
Well David just happened to have his Tele Tinkle camera phone
and a picture was captured of feathers receiving his fire and brimstone
Everyone said it was about time
that this old sod got religion in his prime
But the best part was yet to come
When the Mayor arrived late and was told what David had done
The Mayor said he already knew
He had heard it all over the car radio news
So there you have it another Dodgy Dave the Vicar Tale
On how he had a church service on such a small scale
Capturing his friend Feathers so all could retell
The Vicar's Moto 'Have Pulpit Will Travel'
