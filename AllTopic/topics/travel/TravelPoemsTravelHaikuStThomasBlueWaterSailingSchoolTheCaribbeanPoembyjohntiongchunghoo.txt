St Thomas
Blue Water Sailing School
we learn to sail as well as party
If you've ever wanted to learn how to sail, here's your chance: Go on an intensive sailing tutorial aboard a luxury yacht with the Blue Water Sailing School in St. Thomas. Spend at least 55 hours of instruction in hands-on bareboat sailing over seven days. In your down time, relax with a book in your stateroom, dine on delicious meals prepared by the crew, or party with locals on famous beaches. At the end of the week you'll have earned your American Sailing Association bareboat-chartering certification.
