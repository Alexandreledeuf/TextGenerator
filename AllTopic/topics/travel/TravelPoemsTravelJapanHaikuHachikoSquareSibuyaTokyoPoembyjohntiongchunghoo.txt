Hachiko is Japan's most famous dog which has been immortalised just outside Sibuya Station. The Statue of the dog, known to have waited at the Station for years for  his master's return, has become a tourist attraction. The dog became famous after its strange behaviour was spotted by journalists and the story of his long wait for master's return from the War  published throughout Japan. He never gi ves up. He is still waiting there. Shibuya is Japan's fashion centre.
