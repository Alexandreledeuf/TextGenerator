our  boat cuts through  Berlin
Having made an incredible comeback in the last 19 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Berlin fascinates with a rich mix of history, art, and architecture. Tour the city by double-decker bus, or see it from below street level with one of the many boat tours on the Spree River, which runs through the 'Mitte' or central district, and provides views of east and west Berlin.
