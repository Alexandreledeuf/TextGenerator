Travel!
Do not hesitate
as hesitation is leading to defeat.
Travel!
And enjoy it.
Travel through time.
Travel!
Until you find the truth,
no matter where it is hidden.
Travel!
And search for it
even if it was in the unknown.
On the road
leading from east to west.
So, we may meet there.
For the best.
