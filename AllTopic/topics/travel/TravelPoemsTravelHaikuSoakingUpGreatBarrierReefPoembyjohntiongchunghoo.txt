no barrier
corals, fishes, urchins
soaking up premier Aussie park
Summer is in full swing down under and the water's perfect for checking out the Great Barrier Reef. But ideal scuba weather means crowds, so skip the dive spots typically overrun by the day-trippers. Hop on a live-aboard dive boat for a multi-day expedition and it'll just be you, yourself, and the fish among the most beautiful and solitary coral Australia has to offer.
