Great Wall
galloping over the mountains
boulders, rocks, stones and bricks
walking over
blocks and blocks
of China's insecurities
the great wall
my heart leaps
over the hills and mountains
the great wall
so lightly my heart lifts
over the hills and mountains
the great wall
so light it lifts over
the hills and mountains
the great wall
so lightly my mind is lifted
over the hills and mountains
great wall
it winds over hills, mountains
to the moon
to the moon
the great wall winds
up and down, up and down
great wall
it crosses mountains, hills
and two thousand years
the great wall
now you hear
only laughter
the great wall
now laughter
all over
the great wall
each step a death
- in Chin's honour
each step now a  pride
in China's honour
the great wall
his swift strokes
the great wall leaps into view
the great wall
strokes swift as chin conquests
the great wall looms onto his canvas
