rhapsody of the seas
my bed vibrates to the  tune
of the ship's engine
The rhapsody of the seas cruise ship was refurbished two years back (2005) . Its maiden trip was in the Caribbean sea in 1997. The age of the ship tells because as soon as the engine is on, my bed shakes a bit.  Rhapsody of the Seas now plies routes calling on ports such as Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Langkawi, Phuket, Hong Kong, Fukuoka, Seoul, Danang among others in the Asia Pacific.
