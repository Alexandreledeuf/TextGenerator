take a dash of light blue
and let it run into two dashes of white
that would come close to the enchanting milky blue water
of Luang Prabang's magnificent kuangsi waterfall
water cascades majestically down a towering cliff
then spreads into numerous euphoric pools
where people loosen themselves in the magical waters
an afternoon serenaded by laughters that echo between
splahses of joy and ecstacy
