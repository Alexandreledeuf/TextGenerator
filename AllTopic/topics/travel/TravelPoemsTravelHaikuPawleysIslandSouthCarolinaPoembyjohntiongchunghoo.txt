Pawleys Island
an entree to the day's adventure
a yummy southern breakfast
Spring is the time to visit South Carolina, when temperatures average between 68 and 83 degrees and humidity is low. Visit Pawleys Island, one of the country's oldest beach resorts, just south of the more crowded and developed Myrtle Beach. Stay at the Evans Pelican Inn, an antebellum beach house, and wake up to a Southern-style breakfast with biscuits, grits, and crab salad. Rent a bike and spend the day exploring this tiny barrier island or lay out on its four miles of beaches.
