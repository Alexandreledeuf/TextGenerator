What better way to end a long day of hiking than to sit down to a hot, full-course meal? In summer, seven of the eight Appalachian Mountain Club's White Mountain Huts are full service, meaning hut crews will prepare you dinner while you relax. If you can't hit all the huts on the weeklong 60-mile route, spend a long weekend hiking to Greenleaf and Galehead, the most remote of the sky-scraping huts, which afford expansive views of New Hampshire's mountains.
