Shark Island
run down places echo each
of my words to my ears
Shark Island
dilipidated buildings
whisper back to me
Shark Island
i write to Hollywood to make
horror movies here
Shark Island - knocking on
broken doors of buildings
- my imaginative mind
Shark Island
you will never feel you are
alone
Shark Island
a crow nearly flies away
with my life
Travel six miles off the coast of Connemara, Ireland, and you'll reach Inish Sharkâ€”or Shark Island. A hundreds-strong fishing and farming community once occupied this small, lush isle, but after decades of tough living the island was abandoned in the 1960s. Today, all that remains are the skeletal ruins of the stone-hewn village: homes, school rooms, and a church. Arrange visits to this eerie place via the town of Clifden or from neighboring Inishbofin Island.
