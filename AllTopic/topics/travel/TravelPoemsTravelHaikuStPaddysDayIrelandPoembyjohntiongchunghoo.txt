st paddy's day
dublin distills its best
into our spirits
As Saint Paddy's Day nears, what better time to check out the pubs, breweries, and distilleries of Ireland? Go to Guinness' James' Gate Storehouse in Dublin to see how the famous dark stout is brewed, the Hilden Brewery in Lisburn to sample real draft ales, or the Old Jameson Distillery in Dublin to taste triple-distilled Irish whiskey. You'll be sure to find friendly Irishmen (and women)  to share in a few pints and join in on some fun and lighthearted amusementâ€”or, in a word, craic.
