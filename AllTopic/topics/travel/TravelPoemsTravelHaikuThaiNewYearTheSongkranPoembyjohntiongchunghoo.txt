songkran
between shivers their
roaring laughters
songkran
their warm laughters break
through the chill
songkran
the water breaks the ice
between the city folk
songkran
her lotus lamp floats out
to sea
songkran
amid the sea the lotus lamp
flickers
foreign land
roaring joy as the lotus lamp
floats out to sea
as her songkran lamp
floats out to sea
her silence and tears
Songkran
water too cleans
away bad luck
Songkran - water
laughter, and jeers
make the day
the tourists say
splash us
splash us
Songkran
he laughs 'the  bad year
is now washed away'
Thailand's traditional New Year's festival, Songkran, will be celebrated from April 12 to 15. Though Songkran involves making food offerings and participating in religious rituals, it entails one especially fun traditionâ€”the water fight that occurs on Khao San Road in Bangkok. As it's considered good luck to splash water on others during this celebration (and it's also the hottest time of year in Thailand) , people bring water guns, buckets, and even trucks full of water to join in on the fun.
