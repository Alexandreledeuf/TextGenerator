your travel
you traveled.....and left me.....
left me alone in a dark desert,
left me between sad mountains and an empty space..
don`t hear anthing, just echo of my voice..
your love sneak away to my heart, so i loved you...
you left me, and left a volcano of craving in my heart...
left me and left my tears rain out of my eyes..
left me, and i still see your vision in my mind...
visit me all a night while i watch a stars..
my feelings light with a fire by missing you..
you left... where you left..
wish that i know...
