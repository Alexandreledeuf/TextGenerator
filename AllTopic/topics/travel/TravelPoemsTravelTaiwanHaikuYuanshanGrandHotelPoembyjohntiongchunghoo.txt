a 'grand' way to remember
Yuanshan Grand Hotel?
a broken coffee cup and a
waitress who asked for money
before the guest is even done with his food
Yuanshan Haiku
Yuanshan cold nostalgia
fading at a forlorn corner
Soong May Ling's smile
The hotel must have been a sad memory for late Soong Mei Ling.  Me too. A coffee cup broke and worse, a waitress asked for money before even I finished with my food. I just wonder how an internationally known hotel can have such 'unthinkable' service. They trained them in Chiang Kai Shek's army?
