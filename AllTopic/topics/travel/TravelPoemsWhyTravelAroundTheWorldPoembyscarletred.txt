sre,
I want to go to Hongkong
In Disneyland rides I will enjoy
I want to go to Thailand
In superb beachâ€™s sand I will stand
I want to go to Michigan
With cold snow I will play
I want to go to India
To see the famous Taj Majal
I want to go Italy
In famous love boats I will ride
I want to go to Dubai
In seven-star hotel I will dine
But why spent too much traveling
Wherein all I need is just here
Sitting beside you my baby
Gives me all the pleasure I need
