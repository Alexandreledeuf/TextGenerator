oh on! the golden buddha
is at the same level
as my feet
i felt really awkward while visiting the royal palace museum as many o the sacred relics in cabinets were at the same level as my legs and feet. i somehow felt that buddha images should be placed on the upper level of cabinets.
beside the sleeping buddha
statue of a couple
corpulating
this is what i saw at a tourist spot where they sell statues of the buddhas and other stuffs. i thought this is really insensitive to the buddha and the religion. loatians should know how to give buddha the respect since it is the official religion
