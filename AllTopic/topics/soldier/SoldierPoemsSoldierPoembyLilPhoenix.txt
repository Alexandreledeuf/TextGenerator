It's good to feel pain, It lets me know I'm alive.
Roll with the thunder, Know that I'll survive.
March on I'm a soldier, No matter the war.
Keep my head up I'm a soldier, I'm tough to the core.
My fear is my weakness, Let my weakness be gone.
I know I'm a soldier, I've been one all along.
We are picking our battles, Fighting our wars.
We hold the weight of the world, Our minds and bodies are sore.
But push on I'm on a soldier, The stronger of some.
A soldier of life, In an army of one.
It's good to feel pain, It lets me know I'm alive.
Take the jolt of lightning, Know that I'll survive.
