When its late at night
And I am all alone
I look up at the sky
And remember you are gone
Gone from this place
Where I am at now
Gone to a place
That I disavow
It’s hot and sandy
I never want to go
It’s far and distant
I will never fully know
When I get a call
Few and far between
You have to watch what you say
For reasons left unseen
I don’t know what you’re doing
Or where you are at.
I don’t know who your with
Are you somewhere in combat?
I want you here with me
I want you by my side
I want you for my self
This feeling I will not hide
There is so much you are missing
With our little girl
You’ve never even seen
Her cute little curl
Somewhere in Iraq
Fighting in their war
Is my loving husband
Of whom I most adore
Months go by
Time fades away
My love grows stronger
Each and everyday
My husband, my soldier
My hero, my friend
I love you right now
I love you till the end
Before we even know it
You will be home
In this place together
We will forever roam
My husband, my soldier
My hero, my friend
You and me together
Our love will transcend
DEDICATED TO SGT DAVID LANE, IRAQ 05-06.
