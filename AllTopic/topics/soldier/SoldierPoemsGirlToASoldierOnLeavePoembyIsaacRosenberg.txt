Girl To A Soldier On Leave
Love! You love me — your eyes
Have looked through death at mine.
You have tempted a grave too much
I let you — I repine.
I love you - Titan lover,
My own storm-days Titan.
Greater than the son of Zeus,
I know whom I would choose.
Titan — my splendid rebel —
The old Prometheus
Wanes like a ghost before your power —
His pangs were joys to yours.
Pallid days arid and wan
Tied your soul fast.
Babel-cities smoky tops
Pressed upon your growth
Weary gyves. What were you
But a word in the brains ways,
Or the sleep of Circes swine.
One gyve holds you yet.
It held you hiddenly on the Somme
Tied from my heart at home.
O must it loosen now? — I wish
You were bound with the old gyves.
Love! you love me — your eyes
Have looked through death at mine.
You have tempted a grave too much.
I let you - I repine.
