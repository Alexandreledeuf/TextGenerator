Ode to the Fallen soldier,
For he has made the ultimate
Sacrifice for his world.
Ode to his Mother for while
She lives, the grief and sadness
Take their toll on her mind, as
She goes throughout her day,
Answering questions like “are
You ok? ” and “where is your
Son, I haven’t seen him for a while? ”
She always answers, “yes I’m fine”
Or, “he’s away.” But she knows, inside,
She can’t deny.
Ode to the son he left behind,
For he will grow up without
Knowing who his father is,
Only what he’s done. Never
Will he play catch in the yard,
Like the neighbors next door.
Never will he hear that “Man to
Man” talk, that all boys should.
Ode to the music that will never
Be heard, for the only music
He made, rests in his heart.
Ode to the art that will never be
Seen, for the only art he made,
Remains in a box underground.
Ode to the Fallen Soldier, who
Died so we could live, the way
All mankind should, happy and free.
