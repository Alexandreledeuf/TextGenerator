I was born a soldier,
to protect some place,
that was never my own.
I was the perfect soldier,
until he came along,
and ruined it forever.
He was my celestial soldier,
he was my first true love.
Milady Fate has a cruel side.
She ripped us apart forever,
so I became what I hated,
the perfect soldier once more.
So in the end I have become,
My own Celestial soldier,
for I can never have my own again.
