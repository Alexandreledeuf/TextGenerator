Hey! My handsome soldier
Your crystallized eyes destined
to be a bachelor in your entire life?
These eyes can mesmerize
Thousands of innocent lass in the world
Your young courage
Forced you to an unnecessary war.
You fought for others
With your colleagues.
These well to do hypocrites enjoy
With their off spring
And still we vote for them.
Do not worry my dear
The experience you gained
Is the preliminary qualification for the battle of Life?
To my unseen friend Dave.Tanguay
