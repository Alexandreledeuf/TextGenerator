A pauper takes out a notepad from his satchel
And scribble something with a pencil.
Where is the bitter pill that neutralizes the hunger?
I have never been to a school and don't know the capital letters,
Commas, Fullstops, Semicolons and Question marks in this misery life.
Even I cannot erase my sins as it's against the law it seems.
I humbly request a death with dignity
If someone hears patiently?
* [ And how does this happen to me, that the Mother of my Lord should come to me.]
