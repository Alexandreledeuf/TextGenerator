As I gasp for breath,
and realize,
I've been hit,
It's my time to die.
I crawl and heave,
and try to run,
In the passing rays,
of the setting sun.
My arm is wounded,
my leg is broken,
blood is everywhere,
my clothes are soaken.
I try to stand,
but start to fall,
I hear my leaders,
retreating call.
The gun fires stop,
as quickly as they came,
I just want it to end,
the burning pain.
My men, my friends,
I start to cry,
They left me here,
alone to die.
I wander home,
where my song is sung,
I know they'll greive,
for I died to young.
But I'll be here,
For in heaven lays,
the rising sun,
and the new sun rays.
