You're a father, mother, son,
daughter, brother or sister
Yet you are willing to give up
your life for our freedom
You are a friend and you
are family
This is your calling
It is what you are meant to do
You are a soldier
We constantly pray for you
to come home soon
We know that you are doing
your job
Thank you for all you do
Right now you are somewhere
in the world(Iraq or Afghanistan)
You are fighting for freedom
And we anxiously await your
return
This is your calling
It is what you are meant to do
You are a soldier
This is a thank you to the troops serving overseas right now.
