To whom was read "If" aloud
Geared up like in childhood plays
Computer games with deadly assassins
Whom the mother had tenderly raised
Freedom to whom a cherished possession
Waiting family and children's kiss
Hell bound knows his Miss
Empire is won who counts the men
Lost in flag spots reddened with blood
Makeshift homes that shall care the wound
Cold wind hot and glazing sun
Hit the stones he misses the chance
Knows he killed a dozen in cross
High tech weapon is on the way
Track a mine or watch the enemy
Neither winner nor looser
He pulls out the picture of his little daughter
Home is home what ever says the monger
