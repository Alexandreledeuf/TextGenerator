I walk with no man, I always walk alone
My soul made of fire and my heart of stone
I have no pain, ignoring all that I feel
With bones of iron and nerves of steel
This is what I portray, fooling you all
My emotions so strong, my defenses so tall
But inside I'm weak, having unsettled war
Not knowing why I battle or what this is for
This war is unending and cease fires are few
No shots are heard but damage is true
What is going on here, what is this for
I'm a lone soldier in a private war
