At the end of yet another week,
weary soldiers are huddled behind church doors,
reminiscing about the recent past with outlook bleak -
Not knowing that Life can offer so much more.
Military plans for Earth's invasion
are held by the Kingdom priests,
trying to comprehend the message of scriptural persuasion
for bringing captive lives to Godly release.
Between berating and war counsel cries,
there are mixed signals being presented.
Separating truth from unintentional lies
is a real challenge to our minds and senses.
The battle is not ours to engage,
but we must employ a strategy of Love -
To reach souls without offending on Life's stage
by using wisdom that flows from Heaven above.
