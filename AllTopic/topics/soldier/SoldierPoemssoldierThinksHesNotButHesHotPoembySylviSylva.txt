He thinks he’s not, but he’s hot!
Deeply clumsy, dartful smiley eyes… a playful child
The tainted gun, the spilt paint, oh! the tears, the loss
The pain in his eyes…the story of his life….bloody, wild
Soldier smiles with broken bones, for happiness sought
Who wouldn’t, with the battles he’s fought?
He thinks he’s not, but he’s hot!
He laughs at himself, nonchalantly guilty, spins a silly joke
He won’t break but falls over to prop you up, if twice over, you see
He’s no fool, though he would be to make you laugh, he’ll even shock
Soldier blushes when you tell him, for he wouldn’t agree
Who wouldn’t see it, but a shy girl like me, high on the rooftop?
