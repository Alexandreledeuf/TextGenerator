As the dawn begins to break, I see headlights
The farm is just a ways down the road
I wonder if she knows, I'm coming
And I wonder , if she is there alone
It's been a year since the war called me
I went away to do what I had to do
It's been a year since I held her in my arms
It's been a year, shes had time to choose
I've seen many soldiers get the letter
Letters from someone that said goodbye
And each time the mail when it would come
I would brace myself and worry if I got mine
Now it's been a year and I'm coming home
But time can change ones  mind sometimes
And if shes waiting like she said she would
Then today will be the day I make her mine
I kept every letter that she wrote
In battle I kept them close to my heart
She has always been the world to me
I couldn't imagine my life with out my sweet heart
As I pull into the drive I can see
Someone has raised a flag with one lone star
And I can see a banner just beneath
And I read as I pull up in the car
' The love of my life '
' Is fighting for your Life '
' Dear God '
' Please let him come back home to me '.
