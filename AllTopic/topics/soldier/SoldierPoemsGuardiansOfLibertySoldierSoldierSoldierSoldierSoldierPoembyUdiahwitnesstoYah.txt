Whether:
Taking a hill
Or a watch when all is still
Fighting in hell
Or a beach where peace should dwell
Sailing the wave
Or beneath where force may cave
Gliding the sky
Or falling death passing by
The Guardians of Liberty
Have withstood the enemy
Advancing on tyranny
Giving their all, â€˜til all be free.
