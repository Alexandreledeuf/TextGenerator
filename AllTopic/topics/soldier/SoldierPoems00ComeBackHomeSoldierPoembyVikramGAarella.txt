Come back home soldier
Throw your gun away,
Your child is waiting for you
Bring her some toys to play.
Throw the medals, throw the uniform
Head back to your home land,
Your wife is struggling without you
Give her a helping hand.
Killing innocent people is not war
It is manslaughter and murder,
Your mother is worried about you
Donâ€™t make her last days harder.
This war has no moral or ethics
Being fought for greed and money
Your pet dog is missing you
Give it your love and company.
Crops in your field have grown taller
No one is there to harvest them
Your friends are short of a player
Come home, come back to them.
