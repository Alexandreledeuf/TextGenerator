There is a flag on the door, and joy left on the floor,
A woman sobs all day long crying to the tune of an old song
A voice cries “Where is he, Where is he? ”
This voice haunts the woman and emphasizes all her wants
There is letter in the mail that tells the tail
She opens the letter asking….
“where is he, where is he.”
There is a baby cold and lonely, lonely to come
With tears that are not formed yet, nor even a thought
In a cradle to the side longing for the second face……
The letter answered the woman………..
“Your husband died a glorious death, and lived a humble life,
And yet now we grieve to see that this man is dead”
How will the child be fed?
