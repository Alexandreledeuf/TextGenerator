Raining hard,
my back hurts,
I’m very cold,
feet soaking wet,
they hurt, I rest.
No sleep for days;
I drag my feet,
soggy mud,
trench a bog;
it’s full of tears!
What time is it?
Dawn or dusk?
Rats, many rats,
run from holes
in side of trench.
Lots of corpses;
my arm hurts,
runs with blood,
had I passed out?
I don’t remember.
I…….
do not want
to recall,
the hell of  war,
the noise, the smoke,
the bodies fall.
Rains relentlessly,
drip, drip,
it runs down my neck.
Wish I was home,
a warm mug of tea,
two sugars please?
A light, a flash,
an explosion;
as I depart this world,
I wonder, how
this all came to be,
but mostly
WHY I came!
