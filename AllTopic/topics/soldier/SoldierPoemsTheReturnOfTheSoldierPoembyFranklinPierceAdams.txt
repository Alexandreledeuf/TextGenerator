Lady when I left you
Ere I sailed the sea,
Bitterly bereft you
Told me you would be.
Frequently and often
When I fought the foe,
How my heart would soften,
Pitying your woe!
Still, throughout my yearning,
It was my belief,
That my mere returning
Would annul your grief.
Arguing ex parte,
Maybe you can tell
Why I find your heart A.
W.O.L.
