I am a soldier.
Just a soldier, and don’t ask me
What’s the sense
In living.
I’ve never come to know it
For myself.
I am a soldier,
Just a soldier on my path
Of war and killing.
Beyond forgiving
And beyond
Contempt.
Carte blanche
As long as Fate commands;
No strings attached
And no amenability.
A puppet with a knife.
Not knowing is so sweet.
What vility.
