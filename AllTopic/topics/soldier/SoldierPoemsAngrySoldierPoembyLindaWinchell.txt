Soldier in your chair of anger
all alone with your deepest pain.
For the way that people now look at you
over and over and over again.
You fought a war that was not your own
on foreign land so far away.
Then came home to loved ones family and friends
in a much, much different way.
Your legs removed your arms now gone
we welcomed you back with flags and patriotic songs.
But now you sit forgotten and alone
while away the bank has taken your home.
So why not sit in the anger you feel?
it is all of what you see to be real.
You fought to protect a world unknown
away from all that you called your home sweet home!
