I wanted to become a soldier
An army of one
To please my father and excite
My juvenile ambition
But all I have seen
Is dead children and old men
I have aged in a few months
And found bitterness
My tent buddy is dead
Another statistic for the army
A bad dream for me
And horror I will never forget
In forty years will I still cry
At my companies dinners
Wonder why I was there at all
Will I be uncomfortable to be with
As I cannot forget the commandment,
' Thou shalt not kill '.
