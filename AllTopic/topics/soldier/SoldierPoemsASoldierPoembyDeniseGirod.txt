Your Freedom he fights for you to keep
So you will be safe while you sleep
You condem him for being wrong
Yet the Soldier always stands strong
While you have the right to complain
A Soldier will fight for you, in the pouring rain
While he leaves his family behind
They are never very far from his mind
Remember every negative word you say
for YOU a Soldier keeps terror and bay
While a Soldier he may die
While a man he will not turn a blind eye
