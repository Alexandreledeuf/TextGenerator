I was just a man.
I was not cruel or heartless.
I did not live with hate.
I merely did what you asked.
My last night, was not in the arms of my lover.
My last day, was not in the land of my father.
My last thoughts, were not of my mother.
My last words, were never uttered.
I did not seek glory.
I had no need to find riches.
I was not a coward,
I did not fear death.
I paid the cost of one life,
I cannot really say why.
I soaked my blood into another man's soil,
I looked for the last time at another man's sky.
When you see my name upon a wall, do not cry,
I knew, that it was my job to die.
I expect no sympathy
I just ask, remember me...
