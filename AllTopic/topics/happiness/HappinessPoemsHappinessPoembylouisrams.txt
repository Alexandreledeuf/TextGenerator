happiness is what i seek
happiness makes me weak.
plant the seed so it can grow
and in time it will show
the fruits of your labor
it is something that you can savor.
happiness can be found-if you turn and look around
happiness can be seen in your face.!
and it could spread throughout the land.
all it needs is'a helpng hand'.
