It's a beautiful day not a cloud in sight,
and all I see is the sun shinning bright,
and feeling itâ€™s warmth.
I am so happy to see the flowers
and trees are starting to bloom,
and gloom of the cold winter is almost over.
My happiness is to think of how much I love you.
More of my happiness is what you've brought to my life
and being your wife.
I want to Thank-you!
For meaning of my happiness
