Happiness is elusive like the wind
Coming and going like migrating birds
And sound of echoing peals of church bells.
I would keep love safe and strong
Held fast within my heart
Never lost to furies of a purple storm.
Once, I was happy and royal with my lover
Not knowing it was supreme
And through folly have lost all to loneliness.
