Cut skin,
Matching Tattoos,
Alluring night,
Tantalizing moon,
Friends were on drugs
Sauntering down
The summer avenues,
Hands clasped tightly
By romantic youths
With sexual aspirations!
We made promises
To each other
Amid the madness
To remain
Tragically in love
And never change,
I wish we would have died
Back then
In our warped happiness.
