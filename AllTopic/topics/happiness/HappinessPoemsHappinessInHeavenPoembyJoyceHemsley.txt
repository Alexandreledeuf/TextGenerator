I am here with the music,
Never more to roam.
I am up beyond white clouds
Because Heaven is my home.
All my life I have waited
To be where you are,
I am here with the music
And my faithful guitar.
The gates they were golden
The roses were red
When I entered herein
Like a sheep I was led.
But I'll live here forever
With the ones I adore,
I am here with the music
Through Heaven's open door.
