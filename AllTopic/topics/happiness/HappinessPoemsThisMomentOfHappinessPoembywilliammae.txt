If happiness only lies
In a place we don't exist
And only future days
Are one’s we miss
If satisfaction never comes
And dreams are unattained
Then you sacrificed your happiness
And only you’re to blame
The moment that we’re living
Should be lived with no regret
Don't let reaching for the future
Have you to obsessed
Find happiness
While you have your health
The evidence from pleasing others is
You may not please yourself
