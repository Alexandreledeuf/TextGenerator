I have finally escaped,
to a majestic place,
where i feel at home,
no cobwebs on the phone,
my happiness is burning like a never ending flame,
my soul is free and i feel so alive,
and there is no-one here to tell me,
no-one to dictate,
no-one to irritate,
to  play me around,
I'm so free,
and I'm finally...
happy
