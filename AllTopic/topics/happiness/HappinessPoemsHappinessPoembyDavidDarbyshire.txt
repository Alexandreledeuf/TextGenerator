Happiness in usually free,
for both you and me.
But what I see is something else,
big box big fee.
Happiness should be free,
but for many it is not.
Happiness cost some their life and home,
and the dog his bone.
Happiness can be free,
with just a little little effort.
Smile, give or embrace,
or just show your support.
Happiness is without cost,
I am sure we are not lost.
We are all in the same boat,
just wish we could stay afloat.
