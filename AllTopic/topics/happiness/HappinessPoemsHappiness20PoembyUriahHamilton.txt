I’ve never thought
In terms of happiness,
It always seemed
More mythic than Zeus
And less obtainable
Than gold and other precious stones.
I do what I have to do to survive,
I try to show kindness to strangers,
Apologize when I hurt someone,
Never relish in an enemy’s demise,
And never take anything
That isn’t rightfully mine.
What I’ve missed in happiness
Will be returned in the perfumed breeze
Of spring flowers
That God will waft to me
When I lie down in eternal sleep.
