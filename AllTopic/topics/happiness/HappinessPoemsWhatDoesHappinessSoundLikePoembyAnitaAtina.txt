A babe’s first cry, as she enters the world
Sobs of delight, greet this miracle of life
A child’s happy laugh, running free
Gasps of wonder, on making a discovery
That shy winsome giggle, on a first date
Silent conversations that leap beyond fate
A moan of delight when we soar together
When souls tenderly mingle, that hushed surrender
And that song between heartbeats
When a soulmate is near!
