It's not so much the world outside
that make us sigh or smile.
It's more the thoughts within our head
that make life seem worthwhile.
Thoughts of special people
that we have met along the way
and memories of the happy times we've shared
from day to day.
I often wonder on a day like this
If you've ever guessed.
How many times the thought of you
has brought me happiness.
