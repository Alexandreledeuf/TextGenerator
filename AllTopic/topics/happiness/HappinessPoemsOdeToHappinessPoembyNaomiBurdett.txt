an ode to happiness
happiness is one of the many emotions
maybe the greatest off all
it can make you feel all jumpy inside
a first kiss, first love
its all to do with happiness.
but yet happiness never gets thanked
for every thing it has done for us
so im saying thank you for bringing me steven, amy, fayeness, india and everyone else
that means something to me
thank you happiness
