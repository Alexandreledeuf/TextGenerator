Happiness is th smile that appears when your love walks through the door
It's the fact that everyday you love her even more
Happiness is smiling when nothing goes your way
Happiness is family when you've had a tired day
Where do you find happiness do you look up or down?
You find it in the mirror at the absence of a frown
Happiness can be described in so many different ways
So let's just hope when it finally comes it will never go away
