You cannot buy your happiness,
'Cause happiness is free.
Don't you know, or can't you guess,
It's there for you and me.
And what you do with what you've got,
Can change the way you feel.
Just do your best and smile a lot,
You'll keep an even keel.
'Cause happiness is made for YOU,
Just take a bite and see
That happiness is what you do
With something that is free.
