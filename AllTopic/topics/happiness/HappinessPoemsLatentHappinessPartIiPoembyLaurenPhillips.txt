Provoked Thoughts
i find myself sitting
affront this velvet curtain
living an on-going lie
finding no thoughts of good
my shattered heart lost and empty
clinging to impossible dreams
a dreadful thought
my mind's eye sewn shut
with the thread of sorrow
spun from lost hope
not wanting to be found
