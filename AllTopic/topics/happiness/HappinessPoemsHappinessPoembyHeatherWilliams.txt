Stuff may happen that will get you down
Don't worry about it happiness will come around
Through the dark light will come
Someones always waiting for your love
In the thick and in thin
Someone's always waiting within
Your heart may shrink your heart will grow
All that i want you to know
Is that I LOVE YOU
