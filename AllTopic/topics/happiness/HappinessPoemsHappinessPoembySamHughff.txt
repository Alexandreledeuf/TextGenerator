Happiness, oh happiness,
waiting to burst forth from me,
happiness.
To live in such splendour and
bathe in the milky sunlight,
I wish such a happiness,
existed for me.
To live in a world of anger,
trapped inside a bird's cage.
Why won't this happiness be mine?
Hatred fills my heart,
for this world full of anger,
Why can't this happiness be mine?
