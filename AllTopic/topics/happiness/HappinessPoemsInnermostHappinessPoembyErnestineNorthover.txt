Let's go find that great blue yonder,
Far away from noise and rush,
A place where one can sit and ponder,
Silently, in a cocoon of hush.
With solitude, to rest one's senses,
Some time to grasp what life's about,
To knock down all those rigid fences,
And let your wildest thoughts fly out.
Allow for all your hopes to wander,
Into dreams that calm the mind,
And use the time in that great blue yonder,
Your innermost happiness to find.
