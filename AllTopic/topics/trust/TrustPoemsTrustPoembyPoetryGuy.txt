We had trust, but I blew it
I said things I didnt mean
Said I'd do things I had no intention of doing
But intentions dont matter when trust has been smashed.
Words can hurt even without actions
But can my actions repair
The hurt done by my words?
I want to say Im sorry
I want to show you Im sorry
I want to regain your trust
I want you.
