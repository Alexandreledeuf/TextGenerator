trust is not like sword delaying
somewhere overhead
(of damocles or other, praying
for release from dread.)
nor crouching tiger poised to ravage
unsuspecting prey.
trust is never quite so savage
as to  act this way.
nor like some zealous guard on duty
anxious for a crime.
nor jealous ever is of beauty,
never out of time.
but trust is true abandon knowing
quite beyond a doubt
no boundaries beyond which going
love be found without.
and finds it's utter freedom measured
not in proof - but rest.
and needs no guarantee that treasures
won't be repossessed.
like carefree children at the ocean
dancing in the waves,
trust is liberty in motion.
nothing is more brave!
