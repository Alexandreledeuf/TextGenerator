The God who brought you up to this extent,
Has other plans for you in future too;
So, never doubt his mysterious intent;
He does what’s best and when ’tis time for you.
Go, put your trust in God and do all things;
The future is promisingly brighter;
There is no better choice for us, earthlings;
God makes our earthly burdens seem lighter.
So, pray with all your mind and soul and heart;
God is ready to help His loved creatures;
Just do your duty; God will do His part;
Love your enemies; pray for your preachers.
Give God His rightful place; nothing goes wrong;
And if it does sometimes, sing Him a song.
