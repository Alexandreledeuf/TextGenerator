You say you love me, and I want to believe again.
We said I do, in better or worse, that was not true.
When I look in the mirror all I see is a lie and hurt.
I go to sleep in pain, I wake up in pain.
When I am not near you I wonder, I hate this doubt.
I had trust, I had faith in us. I gave, you took.
This is not what I thought marriage would be like.
I thought you were the one person,
I could laugh with, talk with, cry with.
I thought we had it all, And now its cold and dark.
Once the trust is gone, do we ever get it back.
I hate this, I hate this feeling of not being enough.
I always thought love was enough,
I finally opened my heart and soul,
Perhaps that's what life is all about,
All about the people you hold close,
And the time they will betray you.
