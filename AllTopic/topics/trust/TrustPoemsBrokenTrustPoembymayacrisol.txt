If only i'd understand your true intent...
but with a broken trust, was it all meant?
I always think we'd make it to the end
started believing, tried to comprehend
but here you are flaunting your escapades
completely forgotten I watched  love fades
broken trust this heart will never mend
all these pain wielded inside my head....
