Love is trust
even when it comes to lust.
That feeling of butterflies
dont make up for all your lies.
You lose the trust when you cheat
it makes me feel defeat.
Trust in love
because its as rare as a dove.
When we get in a fight
in the middle of the night
dont tell me that you love me
that doesnt make everything all right.
Love is Not sex
expecially when its in a text.
Phone sex dont count
I hardly know what its about.
Screw your fondling
it dont do a damn thing.
Love is sticking together
no matter what the weather
Love is holding me tight
in the middle of the night.
