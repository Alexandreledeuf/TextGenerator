This
Is good advice.
If you trust
Too much too early
Prepare to be raped entirely.
Oh we've been there.
Well and truth, been there.
Got away sometimes
Formed a better plan
Made more sense of it all.
You're fucking wide.
Your fucking wife is a whore.
She just jumped on you like a predator
Bore you kids may be.
But she just sat on you
Because you were the best thing about at the time
Now she roams free
And because you are so weak
She'll wear down her chances
And circle right back to you
You will let her
Because you have no balls.
Trust no one.
I never have.
Even the parents that bore me.
I love them
But total trust
Never give them.
Trust no one.
Out there are many
Who love to prey on innocence.
To steal the wallet that opens too easily.
To pry out the change even the smaller sides.
