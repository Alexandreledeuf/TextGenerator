Trust me now I have to say
Like breaking dawn creeps into day
Like rainbows chase the pot of gold
Like thoughts as words need to be told
Trust me like there’s no tomorrow
Hold me close and let no sorrow
Come between us now and ever
Let us always stay together
Words I’ve spoken place no blame
But words untold say just the same
Conviction to be held and frozen
In your mind for ever chosen
Trust me now and take this poem
To your heart not as a token
Blessed am I for knowing you
I am forever trusting you.
This one is for my dear friend - who knows who he is!
