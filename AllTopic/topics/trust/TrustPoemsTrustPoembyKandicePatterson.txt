This poem is dedication to Mr. Michael Woods A.K.A Big Mike
I trust you with my mind, so teach it.
I trust you with my heart, so love it.
I trust you with my feelings, so talk softly to them.
I trust you with my body, so be gentle with it.
I trust you with my inter-most being, so pray for it.
I trust you with my love, so cherish it.
I trust you with my life, so protect it.
I trust you with my trust, so don't abuse it.
