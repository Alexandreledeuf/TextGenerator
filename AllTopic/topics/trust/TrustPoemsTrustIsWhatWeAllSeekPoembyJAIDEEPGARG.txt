Love is what we all search,
Search in  heart of others
We all want to be loved
Want to be raised up among others
Time is what we all need
Need to get self pleased
Pleased so that we can love each other
Want to be raised up among others
Trust is what we all seek
Want to be trusted and to be believed
Trust is better than love
Trust grows up with time spend with others
Trust need both time and love
And for me itâ€™s better than above
So trust is what we all search
Search in  heart of others
But trust yourself first
So that you can be trusted among others
So trust yourself to become happy
Get happy So that you can be loved
Loved so that you can be trust
Trust is what we all seek
For all peace..
For all love..
For all pleased..
