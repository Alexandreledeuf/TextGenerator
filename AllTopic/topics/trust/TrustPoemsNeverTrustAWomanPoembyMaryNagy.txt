Never trust a woman.
When will I learn this rule?
Each time I let my guard down
I'm left looking like a fool.
They look right at you smiling
pretend to be your friend
secretly recording every word
to repeat like there's no end!
They smell vulnerabilities.
They sense you will confide
your deepest, darkest secrets
and then you'll want to hide...
They sneer with twisted lips
and glowing eyes of hate.
You never saw it coming
this turn your ''friends'' call fate.
They run in packs like wolves.
They'll eat your weakened soul.
Don't turn your back on one of them
or you'll have to pay the toll.
They'll wait till you are comfortable
then hit you in the knees.
They use your heart against you
and do just what they please.
I won't say that it hurts.
I've been hurt too much before.
It takes more than betrayal
for me to cry and hit the floor.
I need to heed my warning
and remember when I say...
Never trust a woman
cause her claws don't go away!
