Never trust a lobster,
He may have a charming smile
But underneath he's ruthless
And saves everything to file.
The sea and sand and sunshine
Will have you feeling good
And trusting everybody -
But are you sure you should?
Prawns and shrimps keep secrets,
Mermaids never tell
But lobsters love to gossip
(And they make things up as well) .
Crabs give you sidewise glances
And might seem quite aloof
But you can trust them at a pinch,
They very seldom goof
But never trust a lobster.
I did - now look at me
In Davy Jones's locker
At the bottom of the sea.
