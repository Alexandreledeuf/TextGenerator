Trust is
A light that shines in your eyes
Bright and flickering
As a candle in the breeze
Trust is
The brown sparkles
Shone through all
Like stars at nightfall
Trust is
When you cheer me and keep
Me laughing through tears
Better then anyone
trust is
Making me feel like Marilyn
Whilst I feel like
Liza Minelli on a drip
Trust is
Everything I feel with you
Everyday in love
Always
That is what
Trust
Is
