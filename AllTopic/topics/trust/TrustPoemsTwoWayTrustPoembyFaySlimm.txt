For wet-nosed welcomes and four-pawed hugs, none
Can match the dog. Fur-bound coat, eyes so wide
And velvety melt our  heart and, 'will' gone
We most willingly succumb.  Keen to hide
Our love affair, we fake a careless style
And tone our voice to suit, but when tail wags
As if to break while greeting us, we smile,
Even when there's muddy floor, bedraggled
Dog just glances at us wistfully.  More
Than that, a quiet whine, defined as
An apology is all we need.  As for
Two-way trust it grows, and if by chance passed
Over for a newer canine pal, our
First love pines, two-way trust declines, then dies.
A dog's love is of moment and of now.
That's all the canine heart can feel applies.
Thus, well or sick, lonely or in pain, fairly
Constant, man's best friends let us know they care.
