I knew the truth about me
Without any facts
I knew things would turn
Bad luck always comes back
I fell for the lies
Thinking someone could care about me
Still I didn't feel right
Until things become clear
Before you, I was sad and dejected
With you, I almost started to smile
Because of you, broken by picture
Trust me, I've been here
I let myself fall
Trust me
Nobody loves me at all
The worst is over now
I make myself bleed
My mood doesn't let me feel pain
But blood is everywhere, just like rain
I'm going away now
Trust me, it's for the best.
