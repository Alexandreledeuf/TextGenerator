HOPE
Hope is there in the beginning and the end
Hope is there when you gain a friend
Hope is a gift, a scientific break threw
Hope is what I feel when Iâ€™m with you
TRUST
Trust is a gift that we should treasure
Trust is a weight as light as a feather
Trust was not a thing I knew
Until I found trust in you
TIME
There is time to cherish
There is time to feel
But most of all there is time to heal
