I wonder why hurt exists but then think
'Yeah its good it does exist...! ! '
Since life is not always fair to all us humans
We need to be prepared to face the bad that comes
Sometimes dreams shatter, wishes remain unfulfilled
Yet we need to stay focused to accomplish what is not reached....
Its not bad to fall down but yes it is when you refuse to get up
Rise up and face the truth this is most difficult which many dont follow up
Some wonder whether what they are doing is right or wrong
But i guess we must leave this to God and keep working all along
When everything seems unclear and no ones around to hear you
All you need to know is the 'SELF' that lies within you.....
You yourself have the strength to make things really work
Correct the wrong and be focused only on your work
Dont lose hope when you find yourself at lost
You 'Yourself' can make changes in all measured cost
Then you will realize what lies within you
TRUST YOURSELF in all situations and it will surely help you..! !
