Trust is something
we all must feel
when working anywhere.
As soon as employers
loose their trust in everyone
careless then begins.
You will always find bad apples
no matter where you are,
but as soon as you tar
everyone with the same brush.
You begin to loose the loyalty
that people crave so much.
