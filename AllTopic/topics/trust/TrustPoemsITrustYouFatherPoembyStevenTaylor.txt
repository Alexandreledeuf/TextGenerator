I trust you father to provide
a path for me to walk, ...
and wisdom to ignore the fools, ...
let them laugh and let them talk
I trust you father to instill
a roadmap for my life
that steers me towards the rightous few
and spares me pain and strife
I trust you father to remind
me of my own free will,
that pitfalls lie within my path,
that I must climb uphill
I trust you father to accept
that sometimes I grow weak,
and thrist for waters of this world,
and other love I'll seek
I trust you father to forgive
my sins in Jesus' name,
and when I die my soul will rise,
and salvation I can claim
I trust you father
