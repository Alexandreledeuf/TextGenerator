Your sayin' I should trust you,
But can you please tell me what is trust,
For a lie can reach so far,
Just for people to become what they must.
Best friends going against you,
Jealous and try'n  to pull you down,
And just a couple years earlier,
You  swore a friend is what you found.
Men and women cheating,
Breaking each others hearts,
Abusing one another,
In all different parts.
I find it hard to open up,
And even if I say I do,
Deep down inside,
I will never trust you.
Not because of who you are,
Not 'cause your a boy or a girl,
I just see it not right to love,
When you get no love from this world.
I will always prefer to walk so-lo,
Dealing with ash or with dust,
I will never risk getting a broken heart,
Untill you answer what is trust.
