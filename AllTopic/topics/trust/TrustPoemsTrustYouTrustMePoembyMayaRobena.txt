so many things are said,
so little of them done,
yet trust me?
so hard to do,
please do not say that,
it hurts more,
than any truth could,
you have ruined,
my trust in people,
my trust in friends,
say what you mean,
say it to my face,
do not play those little games,
because;
one day you will,
take it too far,
and i will snap back,
and trust ME,
you will not get up.
