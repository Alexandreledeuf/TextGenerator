As when love eternal as flowing
Dazzles blue by the faith of truth
deeper yet ripples either
And transcended by the bliss
as mystery of love as the myth
When yet reasoned by the rainbow
as revered by the faith of God
All placid into the trust
Seems by the trust intense alone.
the lonely ship when floats in night
in the midst of deep sea in its direction
taking all its fathom by the depth
reeling by the waves in its room
as it happen when does as intoned
fizzles by the fear when fledged
in the mute corridors of silence
as the eternal swing as in spring
neither from impulsion it smacks
nor by the compulsion it glues
but by the inner whispers it blooms
as latching on to the one another
yet unknown to the mortal glance
as reviewed from beyond and beneath
As the clouds come raining the grins
over the greens slushig the sorrow
