I'm sorry you don't trust me,
i wish,
i wish you could,
it hurts me to see you this way,
just trust me please just trust me,
i wont leave you,
i wont abandon you,
just trust me is all i ask.
I know you've been hurt before,
abandoned in all ways,
your spirit tells me of a story,
of much harder days,
i know its hard for you right now,
but i love you just the same,
i know your distrust was partially my fault,
and I'm partially to blame....but just...
Trust me,
because.i.
Love. you,
and there is nothing in this world,
that could change me,
you know how i do :)
So just trust me,
i wont let your words fall on deaf ears,
and i promise to keep you in my heart,
right here.
please....
just finally..
after all this time.....
please...
trust me....
