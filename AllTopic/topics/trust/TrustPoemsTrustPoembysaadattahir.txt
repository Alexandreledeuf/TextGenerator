Chugging train at a station stops
Passengers hop
Passengers Shop
Baggage is dropped
In dingy passages darkness gropes
Meandering through some clammy slopes
Trust delivered on time in tranches
Like autumn’s bare branches
Balancing act at the stop
String of tears water a crop
Another time another sop
One more shop
Whistler signals carry you on
On the fly another pawn
Another dawn
Frenzied throes of compulsive lust
Blocked by trust?
Blown to dust?
Not just…stay!
But no on the trodden, well worn way;
another stop if I may!
Gloom beset and gathering doom.
Cannot you be in a shared room!
Its just…only a lonely tomb
Trust is but a bubble thing;
a silent burst, just a hollow ring.
Baleful swallow in a cemetery twitters.
Profane an hushed silence glitters.
No more views an no more cues.
Time to alight an pay your dues
