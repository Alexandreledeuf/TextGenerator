What have I lost that
He doesn’t understand?
My trust in him.
Emotionally
Sexually
Mentally
Physically
Financially
Socially.
I can
No longer
Trust him
With my dreams.
Without trust
What is left?
Ask me now
The eternal question -
What is Love?
And I will tell you.
Now I have lost it,
I know what it is ….
Love is being able to
Give your total trust
Without fear or hurt. –
And if someone
Truly loves you,
They will trust you
Equally in return.
I can now see
It is a long time
Since he really
Loved me.
