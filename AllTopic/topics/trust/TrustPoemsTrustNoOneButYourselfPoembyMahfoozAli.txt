Who Can You Trust?
Who Can you trust in the world today?
Your friends?
They'll be just as trifling as your enemy
When you are stuck at a dead end
Who can you trust in the world today?
Your blood?
Blood is thicker than water
Don't let this be your rule
By this same rule was I fooled.
Who can you trust in the world today?
Your instructors?
Their job is to teach not to care
Your problems will appear just as thin as air.
Who can you trust in the world today?
Those who inforce and carry out the law?
This is where the world tears
They should be the ones we fear
Who can your trust in the world today?
Don't put your emotions up on a shelf
Trust no one but yourself!
