since when weren't you there?
what was I to do
whos my friend
whos not
I guess I just don't know
anymore
I'm hurt
and sad
but you don't care
you just forget about me
block me out
of the picture
just tell me you don't like me
not infront of my so called friends
it'll hurt me anyway
but
I have to know
just one thing though,
who do I have to trust?
