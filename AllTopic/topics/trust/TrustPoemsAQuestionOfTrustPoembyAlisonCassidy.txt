butter wouldn't melt...
Eyes, soft grey blue and perfectly set
Lashes to die for
and such a clever mimic
He taped the Karate Kid
and played it so many times
he could recite every line by heart
He was only eight, too.
then one morning....
I knew it had gone
- the fifty dollar note
It was definitely in my purse last night
I remember checking
and I knew who'd taken it
What to do...
Confront and condemn?
(and guarantee more lies)
Confront with understanding?
(he's a good little actor)
Pretend I haven't noticed?
(and let him get away with it)
No way!
that night after story....
Sweetheart, I've been thinking...
What?
Well, some kids bring money to school, don't they?
Dunno...
To buy lunches and stuff.
no answer
I guess sometimes you wish you had some?
Maybe...
To buy stuff yourself, I mean...
S'pose so...
Would this help?
I handed him ten dollars
he blushed
Thanks mum
When I checked my purse
next morning
the fifty dollar note
was back
