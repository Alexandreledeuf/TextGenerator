Don't you trust me,
Don't you dare.
You'll soon see,
That you shouldn't have cared.
Why did you place,
The trust on my lap?
Should have let it an empty space,
And then you wouldn't have been in my trap.
You should listen to me when I tell you,
Trust me not 'cause I will disapoint.
I'll leave you all torn up and blue,
And I'll beat you trust and disjoint,
You heart as it will rust,
'Cause I will be the one,
Who betrays your trust.
And that is when your trust is done.
