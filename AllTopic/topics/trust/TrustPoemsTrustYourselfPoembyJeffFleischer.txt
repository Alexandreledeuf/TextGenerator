After G-d, trust yourself the most.
Believe in yourself more than in others.
Always be confident, but forever humble.
Know who is who and what is what.
Close friends are the critical ones.
Gold has its value,
But life is priceless.
Stones are precious,
But never more than a parent's love.
Each day attempt to unlock the door to wisdom
With the key that is your mind.
Be comfortable with yourself,
And you will never be alone.
