Trust is when i believe you...
turst is when i love you..
sometimes trust is scary...
and trust makes one worry...
but i trust you baby..
soo don't be sad, but be happy...
sometimes its hard to believe...
but when my trust in you comes through, oh what a relieve...
most importantly, your trust in me...
you always make me see...
that in the end of the day...
i shouldn't believe in hearsay...
i trust you...
