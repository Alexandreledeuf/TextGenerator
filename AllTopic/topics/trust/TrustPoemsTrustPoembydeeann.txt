he used to love you so much,
slowly, when u said you hate to rush,
yes, he followed all your decisions,
to recognize the flow you follow,
so that he can love you the way you wanted,
with a pure heart, without any bad intentions.
you were very lucky to have had fallen in love with him,
cuz every second you spend with him, he counted,
cuz when you're with him, all the grey clouds are nowhere to be seen,
cuz when giving you his everything, he never hesitated.
you and him, started out wonderfully,
so perfect that people was so envy of your relationship,
everybody, even your best of friends you thought you could believe,
spread rumours that caused you to trust them more than him,
he was so dissapointed even though he loved you, it seems.
you slapped his face for something he didn't do,
then he ran back to his home and cried cuz thinking of you,
he thought you trusted him as much as he did,
he thought he had loved you as much as you needed.
at the end, you found out that the rumours were untrue,
sad and worried that he will hurt himself,
you drove so fast in hopes of finding him,
but suddenly, a huge and fast truck, you ran into,
and the last thing you saw was his beam.
you let the memories fade away,
but that was what he always hope not to happen,
he still misses you until today,
and hopes to see you then in heaven...
