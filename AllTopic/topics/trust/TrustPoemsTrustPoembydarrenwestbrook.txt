will you trust me when I gone
will you trust me if I left you alone
will you trust me if I told you I love you
will you trust me  if I say I never let go
will you trust me if I let it show.
will you trust me if  I cast away your worrise
will you trust me or you just let go cause this is
somthing I need to know.
Will you trust me if I say i need you
will you think everthing is true.
