I tried to write the perfect words for you
Still sometimes I just don't know what to do
What I go through isn't a matter of doubt
or wondering if I'm in love
I believe that trust is the only thing that can make this work
Because without a hundred percent we're bound to get hurt
I think you do trust me but it's not all there
so I wonder if you're in love
Because to trust in someone with every trace of your being
Without seeing or hearing or even fearing the worst
Looking through what hurts to just put all your trust in me
and without that it's hard for me to believe
That this will last eternally
Now don't get me wrong and certainly don't count me out
Without a doubt I have so much hope and I trust that
You will trust in me eventually. maybe you just don't see
That your trust is all I need.
