The trust that happens
as night to the sky
Looking into  the darkness
as  the cries of  the pain
Falling as the dew
as tears of love
And I shine in wetting
as the rain of faith in trust
as the light of faith
tunes to the faith of love
yet intense leading the love
like a rising sun in the sky
