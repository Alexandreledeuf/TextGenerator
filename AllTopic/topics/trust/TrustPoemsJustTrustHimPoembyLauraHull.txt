Just trust Him when  you can't see,
Just trust Him and believe
For He is with you through your shadows of doubt.
He is with you and will bring you out.
Just trust Him, when the loneliness chills,
Just trust Him, and follow His will.
He will surround you with blankets of love,
He will whisper from the heavens above.
Just trust Him and You will find
That He carries you through the storms of time.
Just trust Him and finally be
Free
As He lifts you up
And helps you to soar
higher and higher.
You are not alone.
Lean upon the Lover,
As you walk through the desert.
Lean upon the Lover,
Trust in Him alone.
For when you lean on Him,
You learn to see
How things are meant to be.
He carefully guides you by still streams
And brings you through valleys low,
Until you know and discover
The depths and the heights
Of His great love.
