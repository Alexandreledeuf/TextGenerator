trust is a very big word
you think you know that person
but do you really know them?
you think you can trust your bestfriend
but you turn around and they stab you in the back
you think you can trust that special
persont but they do the same but black mail you
you think you can trust your family but
they lie and stab you in the heart
you think you can trust everybody but
really you dont know who to trust anymore
so dont trust any one any one at all....
