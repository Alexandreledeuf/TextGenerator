I  found a damsel in distress
Wearing  a tattered torn aqua dress
tears flowed sadly down her face
She was a picture of beauty and grace
I held her close and gently squeezed tight
I told her everything would be alright
A fallen  priest fondled and raped this teenage girl
Took away her innocence, introduced her to the real world
I was much older than this gentle creature
But I knew I could never leave her
We married and moved away from Montreal
Perhaps a new city would break the fall
She was introduced to many new friends her age
But her eyes displayed an inside rage
A dismal, dark and gloomy day
Would etch  pain in my heart to stay
Today I found my gentle, quiet dear
Hanging from our kitchen chandelier
Her mind was ruined by a heartless act
She could no longer face the gruesome facts
Now she lays in quiet sleep
In Godâ€™s hands, her soul will keep.
