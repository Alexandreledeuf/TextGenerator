The accusers do what they have always done best!
Find someone to blame for their own mess.
Get others to agree to their false charges.
People find in time that they have been duped.
But then it becomes too late to make amends.
And this is how making fools of others begins.
And instead of getting offended,
People like this end up call themselves...
Either allies or friends.
With trust issues they pretend do not exist!
