In God I trust
That everything is gonna be o.k.
In God I trust
& all my worries go away
In God I trust
That my family will get back together
In God I trust
& we’ll be happy forever
In God I trust
That I will have lots of friends
In God I trust
& I won’t be lost again
In God I trust
That he will change my life
In God I trust
& it will be like paradise
