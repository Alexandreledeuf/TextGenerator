Trust is a traitor.
Oh! You're asking why?
Search and you will discover
That trust once told you a lie.
Trust got me in a cab,
Took me to a downtown shrine,
His priest ready to stab,
To drain and drink my blood like wine.
Trust put a gag over my mouth
Made me perjure as to my whereabouts,
Just to lure me to his den
With nobody knowing my where and when.
Trust took me like Isaac
Placed my innocent conscience on a pyre
To melt my ego like plastic
But alas flames divorced his fire.
Trust came back to seek my face,
With his guffaw reduced to a tear;
And now so out of place
Is an emotion that I once thought dear.
