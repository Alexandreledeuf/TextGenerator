tell me why
should not i cry
just tell me why
all my life
like a dream passing by
they all say
give it another try
tell me why
i dont want to live but still i try
i dont want to die but still i try
no one is there for me
but one thing gets me going
the sweet innocent smile
it says oh come on
dont you dare to die
the hope is still alive
come on lets be together
lets give it a try
i cant live for ever
then why should not we try
lets be together
lets give it a try
why should not we love each other
why cant we just give it a try
oh come on all you people
if not then tell me why?
