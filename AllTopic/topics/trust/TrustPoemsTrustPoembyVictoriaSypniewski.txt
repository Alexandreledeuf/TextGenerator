Take a look inside my heart
Look deep
The truth will be clear
I'm terrified of you
My trust has been broken before
I couldn't shield myself from the pain
But, are you different
Will you be the one to make it alright
Please forgive me for this
I can't trust you
Even if I wanted to
Prove to me you're real
Show me you're true
Tell me you'll always be there for me
Maybe I can put my trust in you
