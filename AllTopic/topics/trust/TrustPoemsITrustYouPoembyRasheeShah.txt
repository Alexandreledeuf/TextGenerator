As I look into your eyes,
Lay within your arms,
I wish you would take the pain away,
Just wash it all away.
I trust you, more than I believe in myself,
I trust you, more than words can say,
Faster than the wind can sway,
I trust you.
When we sit together and think,
I know a lifetime can pass away in a blink,
Do you know, the world is spinning round,
But my head is still on the ground.
Will you believe me if I say,
Your the one for me today,
Your the closest to heaven that I can see,
Believe me when i say you mean the world to me.
