They called you Diablo -
Dank, dark and hissing -
Sherlock asked 'Watson'
What it was, that you were missing?
April 30, it came and it passed -
Like a Thunderstorm in the Sun -
Lightening strikes near the Rainbow -
In Wonderland, Oz had begun!
Tightly wrapped up, you were -
In a camoflouged lizard-skin purse -
But alas, the spiders, they caught you -
While you, the Warlock of the South, wrote your verse!
Do believe, Emily knows why they call you, Diablo -
For Wicked and Evil, you'd spend your days -
But Emily, upon being released from the hospital -
Was apprised, of your Satanic ways -
It was Sherlock and his 'Watson' -
Who split, your world, open wide -
They identified, your nasty persona -
While Emily, healed inside -
What is it that you are missing?
Why it's forgiveness, compassion and love -
Forever, are you just a doomed snake?
With nary a hint, of our God above?
'Keep Your Windows Locked'
And Your 'Alarms On'...It is getting
Close to Halloween!
