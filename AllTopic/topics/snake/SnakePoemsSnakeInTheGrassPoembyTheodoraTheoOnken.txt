We do not know your method...
As of yet, it is unclear
Like a snake in the grass, you move
Filling us full of crap, my dear! ! ! !
Can feel it, when under the influence...
As the blood pressure truly soars
Heart beat is rapid and irregular
Yet you continue on with more and more;
How many trips to the doctor will it take?
How many tests on our food and drink?
What will it take to make you stop?
If you have a conscience-what do you think?
Call it whatever you want but its criminal
For now we will just call it crack cocaine
And WE WILL get the proof that is needed...
Even if, this all causes a world of pain;
What is it that you are after?
Because you have achieved at making people ill
Were you hired by Mr. West Coast-Boston?
Or are you just out for the thrill of the kill?

Food or drink with drugs that kill...
Premeditated Homicide In The Making
An ongoing problem-A Reality
