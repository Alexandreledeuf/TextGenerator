Adam is the man
obedient son of God
placed as the favored one in Paradise
and of all the fruits
he must all eat
except
the Apple (they say it could
be an apricot
or a pear, some ways to confuse
this myth of an apple
of discord)
the source of the test
for the temptation
to eat or not to eat? that is the
question, and then comes the villain
Snake
the Seducer promising that if Adam
eats the Apple
he will know
Right from Wrong
Pleasure from Pain
Sorrow from Joy
Is this not good after all for Man
to be Enlightened? I ask.
Let us not put Eve in the picture
even then
granting that the myth is true
or is it a way of literature telling
us
Man must not know much
He must only obey
and not Use his own Mind
If i were Adam, i will do the same
Less Eve, I shall grab the apple and
chew it well, swallow it all
lick the last dropp of its pulp.
I like to be responsible for myself Now.
To know Myself
That i have committed Sin
or that i have pleased God sometimes
or that i have too
displeased Him.
The Apple
Even without the Snake I know
I shall love the taste
And happier outside the gates
of Paradise
Lots of places to go, Now,
adventures to make, which of course,
enlarges the volume of the Bible
a thicker book, more pages to read
and increase its sales.
