The snake has lost his luster,
As his venom now I see,
Though his movements remain graceful
They intrigue even me
I sit still beside him waiting,
For what I am unsure,
I could once again be bitten,
But he's left me wanting more.
For now though he is resting,
And i watch with hoe in hand;
His strike I know, is sudden
But I too could take a stand...
Dear serpent, rest your eyes
Don't mind this battered hoe
Know for you, I've been so loyal;
With peaceful sleep I pray you go.
