Now he was standing on the border.
He heard his own voice say
this deadly option reconsider
also heard it say
your hunch can betray
so can your sense
pause man before you travel the distance.
No, he wouldn't listen to that voice
having made the choice
not anymore to defer
what deserved the woman that wronged her.
She was giggling and saw no harms
when he picked her up in his arms.
The rock python smelled flesh falling from the sky.
You have to die he whispered you have to die.
The gateman was dozing and no eyes had watched him.
He must now run away from this bad dream!
