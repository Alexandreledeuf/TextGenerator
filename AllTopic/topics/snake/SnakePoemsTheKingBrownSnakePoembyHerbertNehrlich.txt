'Twas just a dog, I tell myself.
An animal like any other-
one gets a new one off the shelf,
forgets the old one and her mother.
The wound is deep, the pain severe.
The knife went quickly to my heart,
and twisted there...
Oh, did it smart!
I truly love you, little Tilly!
I miss your eyes, your smell, your touch.
Perhaps it's childish, dumb or silly,
I did not know it hurt so much.
'Twas something special that we had.
How foolish that I tought it'd never end.
And though this shock could surely send one mad,
I'll have to live without my dearest friend!
And if there is a God who let this happen
I'd find him quite deranged and very cruel:
I couldn't help, he could have sent a weapon,
but God, I challenge you -just you and me- a duel.
'Cause God where were you in her darkest hour?
Did you just watch, and did you have to blink?
I thought you loved the smallest little flower
then why not me and Tilly - do we stink?
An afterlife may just exist,
it seems that many do believe.
I'll punch the gates in with my fist
and find my Tilly, end our grief.
So farewell now to you and Perle.
we'll meet again and we shall smile!
Don't ask me when, my little girl,
just wait awhile just wait awhile.
I know you'll do alright up there,
your eyes alone will see to that;
the rest of you, your fuzzy hair,
a perfect ten, a perfect pet!
The company is good, you hear:
There's Max and Benson, Fritz and Willy.
Your playmates always found you dear,
so have a good time, little Tilly.
'Twas just a dog, so people say.
An animal, perhaps quite clever.
But you and I know that you'll stay
safe in my heart - with me forever.
