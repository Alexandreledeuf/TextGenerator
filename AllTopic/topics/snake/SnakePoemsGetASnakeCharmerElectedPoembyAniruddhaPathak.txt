Hitler once brought in a rooster
In parliament his point to pester,
And then one after another
He started pulling its feathers.
After making it featherless
Threw the hapless bird amidst roar
And threw to it food-grains on floor;
It followed him as one might guess
Forgetting all inflicted pain,
Focussing on the dole of grain!
Triumphant, Hitler looked around,
And the point was made all so sound.
In democracy it's like this,
This major point should go no amiss,
Watch, first they plunder people's all
Make helplessâ€” each Peter and Paul.
Then throw to them some succour odd,
Be a saviour almighty God!
This play, this game is on right now,
Making fool of voters somehow!
So let your wisdom be whetted,
Sharpen it if it has blunted,
If snake-infested be the House,
Get a snake-charmer elected.
