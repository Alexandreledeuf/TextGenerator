A snake is there,
In that cage,
The snake tries
To go out.
The snake is
My partner,
My friend.
But I am not
There in
The actions
Of the snake.
With the snake
I fear my safety.
But the snake
Is there
As it is.
Let the snake
Go, wherever
It likes.
But I like
The snake
Should stay in.
I believe
The snake
Not in full
And I commit
The blunder.
Snake, my dear,
Come on with
All comfort.
