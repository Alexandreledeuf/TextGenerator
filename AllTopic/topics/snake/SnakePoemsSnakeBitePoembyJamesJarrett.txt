The serpent has mingled with my blood
As she devours me, I become her lover
Half lidded eyes closed with numbness
My body tingles from her touch
She has me paralyzed
She has left me speechless
Her poison runs through my veins
I can feel her all over my body
She has become I
And I she
I can feel myself becoming dead yet alive
Becoming, Soil, water and sky
All things and none
My soon to be widow  lays across my bed
And Weeping Mary, weeps
As I  leave her for another lover
I am afraid to close my eyes
