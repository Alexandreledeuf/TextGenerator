The snake and the apple is a sorry tale to tell,
Adam was wandering in the Garden of Eden,
Feeling bored, for he had been created,
A day or so before, and he wanted a lover,
So when God created Eve,
He had someone to talk to and felt happy.
Eve was different to Adam,
And Eve had many sins,
But she felt God must have created her,
For a reason, even though she was second born,
And when she saw the apple tree,
She felt a big smile pull at her face.
But it wasn't just any old apple tree:
It was God's apple tree,
Eve did not speak very much to God,
Because she had Adam,
But she wanted a treat,
And this apple tree looked divine,
But there was a catch.
A snake was coiled around the base,
And the trunk of the tree,
Eve was a little scared,
But felt God must have put the tree and the snake,
There for a reason,
So she took a step towards the tree and the snake.
'What is your wish? Your desire? ' the snake hissed,
'I want a delicious apple' said Eve,
The snake looked pleased,
'This is the tree where all your desires can be granted'
The snake said in a low hiss,
'Take an apple and your dreams will come true'
So Eve plucked an apple from the tree,
And bit into the succulent fruit.
Suddenly the garden turned dark and storm clouds burst,
Overhead. 'What have you done? ' Eve asked the snake,
'I gave you your desires' hissed the snake,
And so, the Garden of Eden was no more,
Evil had now been brought into a world of stone,
Eve had let all the evils into the world,
And she would never be forgotten for all her sins.
There were floods, storms, volcanoes erupted,
People were attacked and murdered,
Priests burnt in hell and children were struck,
Disease and illness coursed across the land,
Swords were drawn and thieves stole great riches,
Lies and destruction overtook the world,
A world God had called paradise,
Stolen by a snake called the devil.
