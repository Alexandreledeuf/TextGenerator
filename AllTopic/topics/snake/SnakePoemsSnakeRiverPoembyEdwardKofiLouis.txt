Sake of love,
Don't shake off the truth when you meet your lover;
Oh Snake River!
Bake me your cake of love,
Make my heart follow your path,
With the rake of the truth.
Daily meal,
To enjoy your wealth oh Snake River! !
And to know much about the world.
Your world so sweet with the muse of your beauty,
With the fragrance of life and the romance of nature;
Like a new born baby seeing the world for the first time.
