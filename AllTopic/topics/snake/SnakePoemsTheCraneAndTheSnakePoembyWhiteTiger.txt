The crane spreads its wings, while the snake coils to strike
Both have great agility, and flamboyance when they fight
The crane hops, the snake slithers
They sleep at night, near soft flowing rivers
For days, the crane plays, bopping its head
Swaying it many ways, before standing on one leg
All white and innocently pure,
The snake sees this dance, as an enticing lure
The snake slithers nearer, to have a better view
All this is happening, under a morning mist and dew
But the crane's alert, she knows what's there
Peeking from the bush, under this damp air
The snake gets closer, close enough to strike
The crane blocks with her wing, and postures for a fight
But the snake backs off, smiling at the crane
While the crane postures on one leg, smiling back just the same.
