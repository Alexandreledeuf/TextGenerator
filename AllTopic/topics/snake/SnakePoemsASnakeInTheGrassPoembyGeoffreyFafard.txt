A Snake In The Grass.
Yesterday I saved a life
In the long grass
Over near yonder lake
It lay silent like moss
Watching us approach
Sensing my threat
But I am old enough now
To 6th sense such behaviour
I live amidst all manner of felons
And I move among them
Quickly I whistled my dog to me
Leave it was all I had to say
Leave it to its life, to its day
And we did without fuss
With her smiling tongue wagging
And my heart peaceful
And the beautiful copper creature
Sliding off into the lake
Tongue flicking
Sunset bound.
