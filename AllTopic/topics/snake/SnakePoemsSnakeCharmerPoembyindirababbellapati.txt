winds rose to the sky
dust carried upwards
further darkened clouds
moving shadows!
lightning hissed
gnawing at 'cosmic tranquility'
thunders rolled-
mightiest of mountains
connecting the planets
in an echo
on the black waters
a thousand hoods
a gleaming hand
held the tail end
trinckets shining
jingled on the hoods!
