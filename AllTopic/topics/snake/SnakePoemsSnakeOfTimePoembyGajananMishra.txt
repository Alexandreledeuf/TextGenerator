Snake of time
Swallowed us nine.
We are nine
In a house
That has doors nine.
We are all
For public welfare
As we are getting everything
From public exchequer.
O my dear, I am not here
To disappear
I am present like the sun
In either the eastern
Or the western hemisphere.
No darkness is here
The time of snake is
Ended like the time of
Thieves and murders.
I am not disfigured
I am with the scriptures
See me, I am here.
