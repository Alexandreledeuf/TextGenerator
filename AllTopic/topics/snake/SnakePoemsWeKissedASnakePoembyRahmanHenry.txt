For more than seven years
We are habituated
To accept the traitors as
As patriot
To know the made statments
As truth
Once upon a future
We would forget
What actually the truth is
Who actually the patriots are
A day would come
When the history would search for
A shoulder
To place It's head
And weep finally
These lips of ours are blue
Not for beautification
Rather we kissed a snake knowingly that
She could bite a nation forever
She could erase our names
From the blackboard of human history
