Our Times
And in all Times,
Getting to the bottom
Of the slippery snake pits,
And denouncing it,
Not an easy thing to do!
Perilous and deathly
Torments, may follow
All those who have
Wanted to.
Cloaks of utter darkness,
Surround the facts,
Discovered,
By those who have wanted
To Star, as the ruling class,
The more delved into
The less known of that
Which conveniently
And purposely,
Is relegated to a silent
Present and a hidden Past,
As elected snakes,
Do all, for themselves
As if living
In a vacuum,
Where nothing great
Or decent,
Ever comes to pass.
