In a hot sunny day at a market place
He bends and shakes his weak leg
While blowing the horny pipe.
Then the snake aims at his knee
And it transforms into a dance for the onlookers.
He never seen an egg since his childhood
But he hides an egg everyday for his bread-winner.
Though it's venomous they live together in harmony
And their living seems to be an exemplary for those who grin angrily at each other for nothing.
