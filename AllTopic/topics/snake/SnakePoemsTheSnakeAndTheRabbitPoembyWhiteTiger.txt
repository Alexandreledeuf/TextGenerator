The snake crept slowly
Through the bush
Until she came upon
A hairy tush
It was a rabbit
Eating his food
But the snake
Was in a foul mood.
She sniffed, tasted
And coiled herself to strike
But the rabbit had rehearsed
How to handle this fight
The snake opened her mouth
But the rabbit was gone
Ran like there was no tomorrow
This confrontation was done.
