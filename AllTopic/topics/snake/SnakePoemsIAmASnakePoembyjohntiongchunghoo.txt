i have taken
lessons from snakes
and learnt wisdom
to morph from
an old wearied woman
to a fine spinster
everybody would turn
their heads as i  beat out a dance
slithering my way to their hearts
without even their knowledge
i have taken lessons in life
from the snakes
the devil reincarnated though
all the fraggled parts of my life
the wrinkled skin of my soul
i follow the snake as it
morphs from old to young
and young to old
and old to young again
living a hundred years
parting the old self
for the new
every now and then
all my sorrows
now you see them in
the shedded skin
along the downtrodden paths
nobody cares to take a look
i never,
you should not too
