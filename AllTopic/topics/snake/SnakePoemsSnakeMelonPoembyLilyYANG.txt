Beside a pond in main,
High and thin sugarcane.
Under green canes,
Snake melon vines
Are their laced skirts.
Bare face and hands,
Thorned by its leaves.
Bare feet and legs,
Entangled by vines,
Still looked for melons.
In a very hot day in even,
Searched for a big melon.
Found objects in a flash,
Ran to the pond to wash,
Then took home to share.
