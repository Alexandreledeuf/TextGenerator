the night fell too soon
and the way I am, I am weak
the way you are; I think you're weak
but you don't show it
you only talk with your body
like a wild animal trying to use words
and my hands are clumsy
and the words I pick are steel
and i begin to dote you
with every fire,
till you cannot hear your own voice in your head
shaking at my persistence
fearful of my feelings
you become water
and find a way to (flow
)  cause you know water unsharpens steel
but my words are now in your belly
recoiled like the longest snake
