Leave the self alone
The perfumes of your costumes
That still is in the air
The path we treaded together
In the nights damp darkness
The milky way that be
On earth did it appear
On my hand when you flew
Like a butterfly from that balcony
For gotten I have the world
It only exist in your bosom
My love away from my tavern
You have taken me into garden
For a kiss under the star of morning
For the story of my being
Was but story of my love
In the prologue you announced
But brief how it could be
I shall repeat it again and again
Only for this moment of great ecstasy
For while I leave reason and unreason
For the sage to decipher
My tavern is empty for the master is calling
My goblet is full and in wonders he looks
Saki has removed the veil from her face
Her spell she thinks who has stolen from her
Keep the place in tavern O lovers
He shall come back when he is bitten
A charmer to a snake is he who loves
The poison she carries is deadly indeed
The doors of the tavern my love for you
Are open in the night and the evenings we cherish
Love unto love is like dust unto dust
Of lofty peeks and melting glaciers
My imagery is the lips of my love
Drunk am I from the charm of your love
Wine to me is your kiss divine
Alas Saki keep my place
A charmer to a snake am I indeed
