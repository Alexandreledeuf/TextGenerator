I still have your book
And you have my clip
Now I know why you kept asking
If I always get what I want
You beat me at my own game
I bet on five but you rolled snake eyes
Thank you for reminding that one shouldn't be cocky
And always expect to get what she wants
But God loves a drunk and so do I
Thanks
