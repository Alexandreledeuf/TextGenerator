I saw you coming gently
with all your slovenliness,
silently crawling
your fragile body
with your icy cold
touch of death,
and suddenly
raising your hood
like a desert storm,
your waving tongue
sprinkled  the deadly venom.
I saw your eyes glittering,
studded like pearls
in your hood,
then your bite brought
great tumult around me,
and pain boundless grew,
shrouding me with
the dark shadows
of the twilight hour,
pushed me to  the
dreaded  depths unknown.
Death came to a tryst
to take me to the threshold,
and show me what lies beyond.
Death stacks life
smiling like an angel,
and being mesmerised
I drowned myself
in complete oblivion.
