In the name of love, the lord of our hearts,
Let me to say you a story, it never hurts
Of the galaxy and the solar way,
There was a planet that shone in day
Its name was "Mars", great and powerful
It was a little hard, but prideful
There, inside it, with the red stones those just beat
There was a Strange and powerful "Snake" that doesn't hit
They live with each other day and nights,
But they didn't know that they are each other knights
Here the story comes:
A night, when the sky was calm and stars were down,
When the mars was thinking, blinking, at the dawn,
He saw a strange, beauty and unbelievable star,
That was shining like a diamond exactly in the bar,
That star was colorful_ and simple _ though
The mars loved it, liked it although
Mars just looked at that strange nature,
It was strange for him, such a unique creature
Such a UN forgetful vision,
But it was so painful for him, such a scission
Because that star shakes his heart and his lovely feelings,
His soul was thirsty for feeding
Then, a Love contract between them signed,
They will stay with each other to the day of die
They were honest in their love, none of them tinker,
Because they believe who does it is a Stinker,
Of a powerful expression in our life,
They believe and so we do, that love will keep us alive.
