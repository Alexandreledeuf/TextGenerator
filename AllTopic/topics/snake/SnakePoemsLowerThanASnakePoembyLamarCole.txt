She was being sarcastic when she said that he was a hunk.
But she really thought that he was a punk.
She thought that he was lower than a snake.
And she wanted to drown him in the lake.
She finally told him that he was a sap.
And that he was a lying no-good piece of crap.
She said that when they were humping in bed.
She felt like she was in the valley of the dead.
She wanted to feed him to the pigs.
While she laughed and smoked a cig.
She said that she needed a mop.
So that she could mop him up because he was slop.
