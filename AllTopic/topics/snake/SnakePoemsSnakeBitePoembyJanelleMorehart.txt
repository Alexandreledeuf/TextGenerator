Snake bite
Venom strikes
Into your bloodstream it goes
To kill you slow
Oh so slow
Watch the venom as it flows
Your blood it pulses
Your body convulses
Onto the floor you'll be
Deader than dead
Venom as thick as lead
Anger in the snake's head
A poison quick
The killer kiss
Snake venom is the way to
Death's Slow Bliss
