Snakes in the backyards
Makes a lot of problem
Snakes continues the journeys
Preferring human habitat
Dwelling houses they intrudes
Kitchen place they crawls
Fearful sounds of vipers
Fearful sounds of cobras
The scaled ones, hooded ones
Huffy ones and huffs in homes
Where to find a snake catcher
Everyone in fear syndromes
The winter period snakes comes
The summer time snakes runs
The rainy season they enjoys
But poor humans in fear of them
When I asked in polite words
A gentle species the giant snake
Erecting its hood silently told
Where to go and hide we ask
The hills and rocks are inhabited
The paddy fields are reclaimed
The mountains ever you cleared of trees
We poor creatures are trying for life
Save us we are poor snakes
Always attacks when the wits end.
