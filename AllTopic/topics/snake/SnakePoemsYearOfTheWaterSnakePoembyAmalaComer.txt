A writer
a poet
a scholar
a friend
Whose shoes are
left empty,
no pen in your hand.
Your words have been written
from the love in your heart,
fill the pages
of history
the truth they impart.
Early morning dew
over fields of Dewachen
a blanket of deliverance
from the hell you have
lived in.
Let your songs be a guide
for those in the dark
The Water Snake Year
brings the new start
that your last words
in this life
have left in our hearts.
