One night I was in charge of the house
When my parents had gone out side
I was having loads of fun
With the radio blaring and paper planes that glide
Soon enough I got bored
So I went to the garden for a walk
When suddenly I saw a snake
Just next to a rock
It was definitely a snake
And it was the biggest one I have ever seen
It must have been a mile long
And its body was a sickening shade of green
I called the police, ambulance, fire department,
Forest officials and held a news conference
I waited feeling excited
While I clutched at the fence
Soon enough they poured in
And peered at the snake
They were amazed at its length
But no one the snake would touch or take
They gave me facts every ten minutes about the snake
And it’s a new species discovered, I learned
Just when I was going to have a closer look at the snake
My parents returned
My father looked angrily at the crowd
I got scared and scrunched up my toes
He asked “Can you explain why these people
Are crowding around my garden hose? ”
