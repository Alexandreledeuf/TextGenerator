You stole all my smiles away,
There will be no more happiness for me,
Just tears and sadness all day.
You were the snake,
That slithered your way into my world,
Coiled around me,
I felt safe in your hold.
But you tricked and deceived me,
Your plan was to use and to leave me,
But you couldn't just leave it at that,
Before you left,
You were sure to bite poison straight into my back.
