Blake, talked you of the bright and burning eyes of the tiger
And the Maker making it,
Experimenting with ferocity, brutality and beastiality
And Milton, talking of Satan and his snake,
Oh, the duality of Creation talk you!
The tiger a bloody and beastly brute will remain ever wild, ever so
As it had been,
But their dwindling population a thin of worry for us
And the venom of the viper, what to say about the fangs,
Hair standing on the body, frightening indeed to come across!
