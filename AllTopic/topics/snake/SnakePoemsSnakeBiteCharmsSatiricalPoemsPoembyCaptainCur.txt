Selfishness and stupidity
tend to be our guides
sarcastic deft acridity
laughing by their side.
Stubbornly ingrained self-meanings
conceived with intestinal blight
garish inscriptions beaming
as we impose audacious rites.
An enigma unto ourselves
predacious, willful as a shark,
persona's forward leaning cleft
snake bite charms that strike the mark.
Mankind's cruel cellular divide
cancers replicating crime
our hearts wretched, open, naked, wide
relentless unforgiving time.
