The Desert-snake was cornered in a hole,
And flushed out ’live, without a single scratch;
A prisoner now with once a kingly role;
To Eagles’ eyes, he’as finally no match.
The victors sigh a heave of great relief;
The vanquished too was tired of hiding;
That people rejoice is the false belief;
The desert wasn’t meant for happy riding.
The Oppressor has been removed for good;
Some dignity, the Aggressors may get;
As people clamor for water and food,
The war seems still far from over as yet.
The Eagles have their Desert-snake in beak!
But wars can find all fighters sometime weak.
