Something moves in the tall forest grass
the smooth skin shines in the sun
a skin with scales
of both brown and yellow
The snake scans the ground
with lidless unblinking eyes
its ears intent
hidden by a piece of skin
It spots something moving
a small frightened mouse
hiding in a clump of grass
trying to avoid the stare
The snake has already eaten
but gives the mouse a stare
the mouse runs off
the snake looks on
its tongue flicking in and out
now and then
The tired snake
coils itself up like an old rope
and goes to sleep
