It was green, it was shiny, it was long.
What was it? Something was wrong.
Laying still in the sun, it gently hissed
From its yellow head came a fine mist.
Poisonous spit? Venomous tears?
This green demon giver of fears,
But no! I won't give into this dread,
A true warrior will make sure it is dead!
With heroic courage I grabbed it's tail
this deadly dangerous deed could not fail
SMASH SMASH then I froze!
It wasn't a snake it was my garden hose.
