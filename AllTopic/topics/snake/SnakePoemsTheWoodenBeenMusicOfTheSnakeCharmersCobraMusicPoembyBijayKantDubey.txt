The wooden been music
The snake charmer playing
And the melodies breaking,
Haunting
Want I,
Want I to hear
And the snakes dancing,
Swaying to the tune of
The been,
Pumping and puffing
From the mouth
And rotating and rounding
The instrument
And the cobras swaying
Want I,
Want I to hear.
The turbanned and towelled snake charmer
Clad in  dhoti and kurta
playing the music,
The music of the East,
Of Asia
And the dangerous, deadly cobras
Hissing and dancing,
Swaying to the tune of
The wooden been instrument
Dancing joyously
In sheer delight
And the snake charmer
Taking the name of the Snake God
And Ma Manansa,
Playing the been,
Pumping and puffing
To break the tune,
A bag pipe like.
