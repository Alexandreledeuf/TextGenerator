People speak a lot about cobra snake
“It is life only at stake” I thought
It harms no one without pretext
When you try to capture him for poisonous test
It has gained popularity
With lots of notoriety
Even person is named cobra for such quality
As it has some similarity
Cobra is known protector
It moves in jungle freely with no fear
It has its own kingdom
It bites to human being seldom
“We are more dangerous than cobra”
Keep hatred intact and wait for time extra
As soon as it is available at opportune time
We strike with full force by giving no time
Snakes are afraid too
But human beings are never true
They speak lies and ask for apology
Take revenge and put life into misery
