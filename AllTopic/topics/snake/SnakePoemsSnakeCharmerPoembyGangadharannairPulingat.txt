There were number of snake charmers years before
They came in groups of couples with their baskets
We the children ran behind them for a glimpse
of the snake, monkey in captivity, and their performance
Poor were they, loved us the children and smiled
Asked to make interests in the family for asking a show
We obliged and cried to father and mother
Always reluctant to show the snake in open ground
However we managed to get them succumbed on our wishes
Allowed the charmers in perfect mode of strictness
Their special music equipment we all entertained
Its sound resembled with a snake appearance
After some time making us more anxious
They took their cane basket having cobra snake
Telling some welcome wishes and sounds of their whistle
Slowly they opened their snake basket to show us
Making the shoo....sounds of the deadliest creature
In full spirit of vengeance it showed its might
Frightened to see the cobra in the nearest
We ran towards our father and mother for an escape
The charmer slowly caught hold of the tale of the snake
Which opened its head in perfect vigor and form
Making some signal sounds using their instrument
They put hold of the snake in return to the basket
After some times we asked for a play of the little monkey
which showed its different body shows as usual
Together with the different gestures they learnt
From the master through strict discipline and beating
They were ready to jump upwards and downwards
Able to walk by tying their hands in back
A very fortunate and amusing show for little ones
Now snake charmers are rare and they are not allowed
To play with the wild creature in public on conservation rules
Still we remember the snake charmer of earlier period
who were part of the play in those times
Though they came for their sustenance that give by us.
