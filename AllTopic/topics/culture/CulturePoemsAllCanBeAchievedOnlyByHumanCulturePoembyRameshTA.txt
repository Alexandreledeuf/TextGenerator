Humans don't like terrorism, violence and war, but only peace;
Peace needs to be promoted by the efforts of people of all creeds;
Creeds or religions are not for imposing on all but for peace only;
Only by betraying, banishing and extraditing outfits, it is possible!
Possibly people of terrorist's religion should betray them sure;
Sure that is the best way to send them out of place in the world;
World doesn't need such kind of beings for world unity and peace;
Peace lies in oneness of God for all religions by fraternity ever!
Ever more than preaching practice is most important to achieve all;
All are for love, joy, peace and development to live as one family;
Family is way of one world life possible only by unity in diversity;
Diversity of all things can't be ironed out by dictatorial command!
Command of military dictator has not achieved anything in history;
History reveals the truth that only by human culture all is possible!
