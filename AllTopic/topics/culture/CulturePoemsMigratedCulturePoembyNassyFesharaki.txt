Migrated Culture
In me there is something like blood
I brought in my heart after the flood
Next visit I searched, was not found
Sample of what I know deepen fond
Was removed and buried under mud
In me but it remains forever, is alive
The changes in old way, not in mind
Old is fresh till I live, in bones, heart.
