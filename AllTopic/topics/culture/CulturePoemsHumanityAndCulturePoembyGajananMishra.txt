Let us come together,
Let us work together,
Let us love each other.
We are one and one,
We should rise and shine
At a time here.
This is our earth, my dear,
We all the creatures are
Living here with light
With air and water,
From up above the sky
We should wait for nectar.
Mutual growth should be
our aim and we should go
To achieve this giving
Support to each other.
As human beings we should
Take more responsibilities
To deliver all good to all.
The earth is our mother,
We are all one family members,
Let us come together,
Let us keep connection to each other,
Let us contribute for better future,
Let us go upward with humanity and culture.
