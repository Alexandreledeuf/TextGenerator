Modern gadgets are eating away vitals of health;
Many have become victims of video games long!
One in England dies playing game for 12 hours
Though sitting in one place to do so before it!
Too much mental energy is needed to deal with it;
Otherwise one's energy will be sucked by gadget!
My eyes have become sensitive to TV tube rays;
So also Computer tube rays are v. bright to eyes!
These rays increase body heat heating eyes first;
Mental tiredness makes one unable to be creative!
I am a lover of Nature to enjoy its joy outside ever;
But to express our experience we approach PC!
Creative work indeed evolves better by this device;
But the gadget swallows up health to sickness ever!
