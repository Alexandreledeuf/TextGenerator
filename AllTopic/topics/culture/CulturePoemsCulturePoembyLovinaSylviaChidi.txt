If we put closure to culture
Then in isolated torture
We suffer as human creatures
So shall we remain cultured?
And mature slowly in grace
Or attempt losing face
At a certain time or a place!
Even the scriptures and sculptures
Historical or man-made
That we rely upon with to trade
Are not exempt from culture
So what is it about culture?
That makes a pleasant picture
This cultivated feature
Inspiring us to venture into adventures
Nod our heads in distasteful gestures
At certain unpleasant natures
For the values a society captures
With or without structure
Right now or in the future
If I may have to lecture
Is acknowledged as culture!
