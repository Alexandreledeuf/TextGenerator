Walking across the land;
Dancing and drumming,
And, speaking with the muse of their language.
The festival,
The people of the village;
Speaking their own language as,
They danced along with the muse of the drummers.
Culture and the people,
With the high tone of their voices! !
In joy with the muse of the festival.
