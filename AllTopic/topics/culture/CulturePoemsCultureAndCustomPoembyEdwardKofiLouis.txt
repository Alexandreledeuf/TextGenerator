Living,
The culture and the style of the people over here are very different;
And, the society is not much open to all,
With full of doculments needed here and there to proceed on a matter.
Living,
Here on earth with a different society around me;
All in the name of culture and custom,
However, the foreigners among them are really suffering!
All in the name of intergration.
Living,
In the land of papers;
With headaches and depression,
Of talents and time being wasted due to the number of years taken to understand a language.
