What is culture?
Culture is refinement and polish,
Is inherited rather than attained
Though can be
If one tries to perfect.
Culture is society, heritage and tradition,
The family you are from,
The heritage you have got,
Tradition carried forward.
Sometimes culture destroys in absence
Of nurturing,
But instead of the things can be envisaged
In the ruins and rubble.
