Let us not become bigotry
That shall pain with past history
We need to learn and move
Along peaceful path to prove
See the result of intolerance
Blood flows with no patience
Now men want god's supremacy
As if crown is in danger by almighty
Have we gone mad?
Have we feeling of dead?
Why do we misadventure?
We have lovely future
Tolerance has no option
It has to be strengthened with relation
Human being is to be respected
The tolerance is to be acted
No other culture can replace
If humanity is to win the race
Let people go and profess
The way they like to chase
