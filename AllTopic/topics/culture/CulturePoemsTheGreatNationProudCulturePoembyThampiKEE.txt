We proud of our nation and our culture
we proud we have great history
we have gifted with great knowledge
we had great leaders
And proud with great Budha
and his sacrifice
The great Gandhi
A gifting, shared as a broken heart
The great old leaders
Each carrying one with our heart of heart
And wings in perfect harmony  of music
and great musicians
Untouched and beautiful.
Lifts from the soul heavenly
Bhagat Sing
Feather fans of sacrifice
When we visit Rajghat in respectful ritual.
we flies to an ending  now?
Miss  to the lights  to a darken age
A prayer for the light to shine to us
