Yes, father wants someone to take care
Look after
And ask or offer glass of water
That only can done be by daughter
This is an attachment
That is with parents
They want lovely daughter
With some smile on her face
Daughter is most beautiful
In the eyes of painful parents
When they have no one to confide
Daughter rushes to take care of dad
Daughter is first choice
As she keeps promise
Mother too wants daughter
To be always by the side of her
So daughter must follow
And grow
With father's guidance
And take chance
Be poetess
With lovely face
And access
To humanity and culture
