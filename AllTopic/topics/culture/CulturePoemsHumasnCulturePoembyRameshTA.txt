Holiday mood in West and festival mood in East
Begin with the last phase of August till September!
Then Winter mood of festivals continue on starting
With Ganesh Chadhurthi, Krishna Jayanthi and on
Continuing with Navrathri, Diwali, Christmas & N Year!
So all the years go on and on in the world life cycle ever
Like the seasons changing from Spring to Summer and
Then to Autumn to Winter to say Good bye to the year!
But fun mood in all seasons connected with festivals and
Holidays to enjoy life in various ways we live life long....!
What a fun enjoying holidays with family and friends
Going to places in the South sea beaches and North
To have relaxation in hill station resorts in Summer!
In Winter palying Cards, Carrom, Chess and Billiards
We manage ourselves against all kinds of weathers...!
Best way of life we have discovered is human culture
We all like to live in the names of national and festival
Holidays we cherish most in heart to have joy and all
Kinds of fulfilment possible to live a complete life we love
Wishing best wishes sending greeting cards and all ever!
We cannot change this even the climate changes often!
Whether the weather is good or bad we have fun in all!
Life to be cheerful we drink to the health of all forever
Gathering friends we love and loving souls to enjoy life!
This is human culture to make even worst as best so...!
