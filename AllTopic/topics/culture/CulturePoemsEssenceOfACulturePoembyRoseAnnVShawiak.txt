Krishna dancers, singing to a steady, low beat with a lively
spirit, showing the beauty that is of India.
A tangent feeling of incessant beating of hearts, taking care
to become a part of nature as one in diversity.
Beautiful language being sung instrumentally with a fortitude
of inner energy and a placid sense of desire.
All culminating in the essence of a culture that I have never
really known about.
