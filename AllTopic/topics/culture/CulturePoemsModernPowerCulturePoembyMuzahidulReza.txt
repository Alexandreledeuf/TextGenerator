Greeds for power have built some ancient towers
Located at different territories called main centers,
Greeds for interests have strengthened those towers
Allocating the each room to their each owner
Where with family power holders live without fear
And practise the systems of power capturing culture,
The citizens debate on power holders and power
Some praise, some criticize and lament the others.
