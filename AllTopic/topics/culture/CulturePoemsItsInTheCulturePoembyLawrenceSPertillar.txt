It is in the culture.
Fed to accept,
Deception.
Everyday it's there and in the culture.
Fed to accept,
Deception.
And to reject...
The telling of truth.
It's...
In the culture.
A feeding to accept,
Deception.
Oh,
And...
Everyone expects to be deceived.
And...
Everyone expects they should believe in lies.
And despise...
Believers and the tellers of truth.
It is in the culture.
Fed to accept,
Deception.
Everyday it's there and in the culture.
Fed to accept,
Deception.
And to reject...
The telling of truth.
Oh yes it's there and everywhere,
In the culture.
A feeding to accept,
Deception.
Everywhere and there to believe,
A feeding of deception to receive.
Everyday it's there and in the culture.
Fed to accept,
Deception.
And to reject and disrespect...
The telling of truth.
Booted or diluted is the truth.
Oh...
It's in the culture.
And...
The telling of the truth,
Few people do.
Oh...
It's in the culture.
And...
The telling of the truth,
Few people do.
Oh...
It's in the culture.
And...
The telling of the truth,
Few people do.
Oh...
The telling of the truth,
Few people do.
Oh...
It's in the culture.
And...
The telling of the truth,
Few people do.
