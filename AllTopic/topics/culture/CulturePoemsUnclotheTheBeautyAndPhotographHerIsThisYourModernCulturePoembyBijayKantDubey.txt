All the time, such a temperament
Cannot take us far away
In the mission and vision of life,
I do not ask you to be a moral policeman,
The local guardian of morality,
But at least think you womankind,
Writhing under domestic violence and bruises,
Flesh trade and woman trafficking,
Slavery and kitchen work
And from these, there is no escape from
And above all, the birth pangs intolerable,
I mean the creational pangs!
