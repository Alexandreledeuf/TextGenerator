When a snowman winks his eyes of coal,
And from their windows children know...
Magic's in the air.
And they wish they are on Santa's list.
As children everywhere wish this.
The Christmas Trees that are trimmed with them,
Excites with the bright lights shining.
Dining festively on treats...
Will be remembered year to year.
This and every Christmas.
Joyous Eid al-Adha (The Festival of Sacrifice)
'A Celebration of Family, Community and Culture'
Merry Christmas...
'A Celebration of Family, Community and Culture'
Happy Chanukah...
'A Celebration of Family, Community and Culture'
Happy Kwanzaa...
'A Celebration of Family, Community and Culture'
And...The Best of New Years to Come,
To ALL in Celebration of United Humanity.
