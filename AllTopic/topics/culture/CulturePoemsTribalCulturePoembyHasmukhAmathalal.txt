Install any dishonest man
To look after and protect the humans
He shall oblige
Improve conduct and change
People were stunned
When saw a shepherd
Giving justice on the spot
People dug out place and found holy crown seat
People believed in his words
As holy as from that of lord
No one questioned his wisdom
He was acting as if king of mighty kingdom
It is place
That puts him above race
He feels holder of divine spirit
Improves his behavior and greets
Today scenario has changed
Leaders have poisoned
The ears of the people by telling lies
And filling their own bellies
Justice is sold in market
Many agents make it convenient
You need to spend money or bribe
We are returning old culture of tribes
