A fascinating idea in terms of humanity I try to define,
Either by Scriptural songs or scientific forms in rhyme,
Religion is centralistic repetition through cultural style,
A consolation of horrid temptations run mile after mile.
Shaping a pattern untold in ancient Hebrew Scriptural text,
Veil of divine sensation for years to bless might we regret?
Sweetly it retains a shape molded by life’s string we stand,
Indus to the Nile, Euphrates to Olympus & woman to man.
Deeper and dense this troubled world fades from the word,
Without guidance, morality, compassion they never heard,
Scriptures via sacred submissions so, who made a change?
Highly synchronized, structured biblical text is not a game.
Old Testament dreams, visions in current forms are fractured,
Knowledge and Wisdom the beginning of God manufactured,
Rituals surround such feelings where sacrifices are no longer,
Immorality! A gateway to doom fells us weaker not stronger.
Neither heaven nor hell by today’s mysteries will ever surmise,
While the Armageddon doomsday will catch many by surprise,
All fancies and scribble that fret are played out by Satan’s lies,
Awaken brethren the end of days will not be delayed by alibis.
Human’s, our own worst enemy as we have free will to decide,
Yielding a perilous journey should you mount the reapers ride?
A fierily pit, eternal damnation, worse than the fiercest Vulture,
Where to put your wager in the battle of  Scripture vs. Culture?
