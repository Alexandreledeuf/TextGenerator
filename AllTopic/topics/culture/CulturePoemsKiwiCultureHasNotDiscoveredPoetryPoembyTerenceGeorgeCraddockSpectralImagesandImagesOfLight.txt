summer kiwi wine festival season
chasing fans on Classic Hits Winery Tour
singers centre stage in wine paradise
singers also sing warm ups at All Black games
All Blacks pose as men drinking beer not wine
poets drink wine but poets are missing
apparently no All Blacks write poetry?
apparently no wine makers read poetry?
kiwi culture has not discovered poetry?
