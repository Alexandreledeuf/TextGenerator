Take a risk
Assess the right and the wrong of it
The pleasure over happiness
The rules over responsibility
What risk to the public
If they knew
They could be poor
And happy too
Alienation what's it all mean?
Okay to show off your latest machine
Don’t mention your need
For the love that could feed you
Such sentiment fool is obscene
It’s okay to talk of the needs
which it gives you
To buy
Keep up with the trend
Keep your end up
In the virtual eyes of
A world which doesn’t exist
For when have you ever
Been invited
To say what you feel
By an 'all powerful'
Ephemeral A- list?
Seen through watery eyes the image distorted
Urban paradise
Staking out a place in heaven
Argue over seats
Tut at the rudeness
Annoying -like a one-sided mobile phone chat
An animated face gripping earnestly
To handset
Coffee long gone in home from home position
Tut inward and out as little kid shouts
And the computer with its upward crescendo
Does musical pap
Alone you may think
But never so alone as when trapped with others
Into chain of thought and command
You alone as a body
But together linked up in your soul with others of Your kind
And others all prey
To supply and demand
'Dear animals of prey
To protect the delicacy of our sanity
We ask you not to hit and run with our souls '
As you look for your fun
It’s the home from home
where you bring your own mates
Out of bounds to make new friends
If  no one communicates
The thin girl enjoyed eating what she yacked up
Before meeting
The new love
She’s greeting
With air kisses
He misses
the qualities she’s barely revealing
Unlike the umbilical he finds so appealing
Pack your own sandwich.
Make your own love
