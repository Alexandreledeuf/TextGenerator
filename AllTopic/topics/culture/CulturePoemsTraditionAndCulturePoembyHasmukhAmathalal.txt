Tradition & culture- Moroccan way
Thursday,14th May 2020
As Moroccan kingdom of an ancient culture
it has all the rights to take precautions for he future
to preserve language, heritage
and equally manage the relations with outside world
it is good to learn more languages
and manage or compete with an out side countries
but not at the cost of local languages
one must hold the pride and prestige
if Arabic language is not given importance
it will loose its chance
as unique kingdom
who has held the tradition and customs
if there is western leaning
it has got some meaning
the world has opened many fields
but tradition and cultural bonds should be definitely held
any nation shall feel proud
and Moroccans should say it loud
here we are and going to stay
for our traditions, religion along with the humanitarian way
