It’s wonderful to watch the performance
As Native American’s show us all
How it was in the old days
Standing so proud and tall
They wear their brilliant costumes
Just like they did long ago
The traditions brought before us
Because they love them so
The music and the dancing
The beads and the attire
Really do take you back
And the meanings also inspire
They feel it from their hearts
And bring the truth to us as well
You can see it in their eyes
And in their actions you can tell
I hope you get to observe some time
The Native American’s as they bring
Their culture to Oklahoma
Watch their dance and hear them sing!
