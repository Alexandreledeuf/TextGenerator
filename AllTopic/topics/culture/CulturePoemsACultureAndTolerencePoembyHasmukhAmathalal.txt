Any culture that teaches tolerance is great
Their back ground and heritage may clearly state
The excavations may lead to some clue
It is remnant of national treasure and venue
No one can simply boost of culture without any back ground
It has to be worked out on certain theory and must be found
All revelations that may come to the fore and in light
It may have to be preserved as asset and declared as monument or site
National achieve is full of ancient gadgets
They are provided with special budget
They are not made to suffer for the want of fund
It is preference for national pride for the land
When we speak highly of achieves?
We clearly see what that stand to achieve?
How national sentiments bring them together in the time of crisis?
There is no special thinking or thesis
We are full aware that national moral should stand all the time very high
National flag should be seen all over and fly
It is not mere piece of cloth but heart of millions
It must send clear waves to the heart of aliens
Many countries are known for their known loyalty
The people have also proved it number of times by remaining loyal
They had deep regard for the ruler of the land
They stood fast for the country with hand to hand
Nothing can compare when it comes to the question of devotion
It is the duty of all population to keep the wheels in motion
Nation may survive only when there is complete faith and awareness
It is necessary to maintain that level with solidarity and oneness
Nobody can afford to be less vigilant
There may still be danger from distant
It is not that only neighbors may prove hostile
Big powers may interfere and watch for while
Natural resources are always power of strength
Country can afford to go to any length
It may not have self sufficiency in all the fields
It may still have the courage to garner more yields
Country may stand fast against foreign pressure
It can carve out honorable path and assure
Nothing can be compromised at the cost of pride
It can’t be bartered or attempts be made to hide
We hold honor and pride if remain attached to motherland
We can work hard and make it as wonderland
It may be so that it has its existence not because of present
It may have  deep roots with people’s consent
