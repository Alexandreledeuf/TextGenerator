After an absence of...
four years intensely immersed;
in a foreign country
culture cuisine employment.
Sometimes the greatest
culture shock;
is coming back
to your home country.
Sometimes then
you do not belong;
in either country
ever ever again.
This is definitely true
when you never;
belonged in your home
country to begin with.
Bicultural people
can however;
be an insightful gift
to both cultures.
