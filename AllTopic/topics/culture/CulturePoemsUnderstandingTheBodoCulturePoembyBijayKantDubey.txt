What have I understood
And they taught me not too,
I know nothing about India,
The impregnable northeast of,
Their multi-ethnicity and diverse cultural ethos,
The linguistic variety?
The Bodos, the ethnic and linguistic tribe, of the Brahmaputra valley,
You do not destroy the culture and tradition
Of the Bodos of the Bodoland,
The sons of Bodo,
Making them embroiled in a plot
As for the north Indians' strategic conspiracy.
Their life-style, art of living, health and hygiene,
Let them continue with
Heir own tradition,
The Bodods of the Bodoland,
Living in harmony,
Not with demands
For a separate homeland.
One of the Tibeto-Burmese family, Bodo language
Takes us to across the borders and its fringes,
Crossing over to
The domains far flung, over to
With Brahmoism as
The of faith of the people
Rearing and sustaining them so long.
Their Bagurumba, the traditional dance style,
We still admire the traditional folk dance,
Their weaving and keeping of the loom,
Their art and craft,
Their love of fishing, farming,
Cattle-rearing and piggery.
Assam and its beauty
One can mark it through the note of diversity,
Thesis and anti-thesis,
A hub of inflection and intermixing,
Opening avenues and canopies beyond
Lading to the borders
Far across into Central Asia.
