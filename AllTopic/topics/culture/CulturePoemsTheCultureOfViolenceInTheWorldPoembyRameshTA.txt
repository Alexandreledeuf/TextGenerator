Violence has become the common feature of stories
And movies to thrill the audience with actions..!
Nonviolence in stories and movies are boring to
Read and see according to the audience everywhere!
In reality too, violence seems to be impossible to
Bring to an end to the world starving for peace and
Love everywhere as mechanical money making life is
Full of tension and danger in busymetro cities..!
Love, joy and peace are out of place everywhere now
As thrilling action and pleasure after action are
The regular features of everyday life and movies
That seem to be all right in the world life of all!
This kind of culture-less world is a great jungle...,
But not an Utopian civilization that solves all ills!
