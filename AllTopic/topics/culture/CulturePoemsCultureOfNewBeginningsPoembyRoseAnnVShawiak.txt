Sandwiched between feelings and emotions are rhythms
of our lives, regulating what we do and how we react
to situations.
Living in the disassociation of human beings towards
their inner universes, knowing that they don't alter
their attitudes or opinions towards anything.
Welcoming and participating in a culture of new be-
ginnings and endings, totally appeals to intellect
and my mind.
Watching how things sway us one way or another, being
enthralled with what people do in different situations
and environments.
