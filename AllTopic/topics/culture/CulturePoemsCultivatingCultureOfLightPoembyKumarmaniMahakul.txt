At this beautiful morning now,
We are cultivating culture of light,
This light is gift of God is adorable,
Beauty has defined justice of joy.
Cultivating culture we learn art,
From past history to present day,
At each moment at present in fortune,
Sun sprinkles rays of mercy of God.
Culture of light is light of wisdom,
Practicing awakening of self is nice,
Justice of love is revived with trust,
Culture of light is eternal and infinite.
We live in this garden of God in truth,
We obey his command everyday in heart,
Perceiving light we perceive his mercy,
Light sings his glory guiding us ever.
