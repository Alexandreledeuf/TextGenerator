The Indian culture is very sound,
it is based upon the family background.
The bond of their relationship is such found,
that we can smell the presence like the hounds.
The Indian families are generally spiritual,
living in a joint family is traditional.
Love among each other is proportional,
the partition of property makes them emotional.
The support of the members is generous,
their affection towards us is precious,
their devotion towards us is fabulous,
these things make me feel very specious.
The strength of the family can even fight with the tide,
where sadness goes away and hide.
Where even obstacles give them the side,
being the member of such a family is my pride.
