The earth has been shaped and forged
For over 4.5 billion years, there is no hurry
Ice formed and shaped the valley,
Plates collided, they were in no hurry.
Mountains climbed, some would say 7
7 culture mountains, they'd be business,
Government, media, arts, and entertainment,
Education - the family and religion.
7 mountains sitting on the throne
On the throne of the earth,6 chess pieces
6 physical 3D realmsâ€¦ 1 spiritual
Now, this is a battlefield for change agents.
This calling and a catalyst for change!
They want you to infiltrate the mountains.
To be their salt and light a mustard seed
For change and build a new earth.
In 4.5 billion years man might just be a fish.
Good for nothing on some distant frozen planet
But on a hook still where there's no hurry
Swallowing orbs golden of starlight.
Ye are the salt of the earth:
But if the salt has lost its savour,
Wherewith shall it be salted?
"Can strategies cause a tipping point in culture? "
Their argument is it has before.
