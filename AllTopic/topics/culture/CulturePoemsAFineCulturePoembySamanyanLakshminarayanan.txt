They were indeed simple people
the people of the east
A FINE CULTURE they did have
the people of the east
A FINE CULTURE
the east should have given the rest
when the west brought out the 'machine'
the east brought out the 'human'
Today's world  is not lacking in machine
Today's world is lacking in human
Today's east is sending 'productive men' all over
the east should have sent 'human men' all over
How did the east stray?
when did it loose it's way?
The east then found everything in simplicity
simplicity was it's strength and beauty
simplicity gave the east it's integrity
simplicity never ever gave the east an inferiority
Today the east mocks the west
the 'material' wealth of the west..has
put to rest...the
true spirit of the east
We blame it on simplicity
we say we were plundered due to our simplicity
a handed down book on simplicity
only became a liability..we say
What the west had gained
everybody did gain...the 'machine'
what the east had lost
everbody did loose...the 'human'
Today what are we in
an 'un human' man is managing a dangerous dumb 'machine'...and
THAT'S THE DANGER WE ARE IN...without
a fine culture
