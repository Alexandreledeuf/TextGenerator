The celebration is on
For simple man
And really remembered as human
Who helped villagers as headman?
No one remembers
And offers
So much of respect
But for noble acts
The story might have remained untold
But whole of the village was told and retold
About great man every year
His loss was felt very dearly
The village culture is different
Even today it is present
The activity of head man is seen with keen interest
Ashe tries his level best
Only good people are remembered
So the great tribute is offered
On his death anniversary
To remember his contribution and carry the impression
