Himalayan mountains the snow ranges
In heights stands there in pride
Makes a strong wall to my country
A natural safety and boundary always
People came for commerce and knowledge
They studied here the great things
Thakshasila and Nalanda universities
Which were the great knowledge centers
Sanskrit texts the source of knowledge
Various subject they dealt with
The dedicated sages written the texts
The depth of knowledge about the universe
The stars, countries, people, seas
They made their subjects for writing
Ayruveda the knowledge of natural medicine
Yoga and meditation a unique experience
Scholars on poetry, dramas, and dances
Abundant they written in texts
The great text of economics that written
Chanakya  the genius lived here
The Centers of learning Budha Monastries
Professed religion of peace and non violence
May be the influence of snow mountains
The calmful climate that gave inspiration
Himalaya stands ever in heights and proud
As a silent witness of world happenings.
