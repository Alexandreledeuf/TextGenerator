Art and culture,
Going my own way;
With my imagination,
With my style,
With my innovation,
With my works,
With my words,
With my mind,
Respecting my culture!
And, touching the world with my muse.
Art and culture!
The muse of life;
With the ways of nature,
Resting on mankind,
In every land.
My imgination!
My nation;
The place of my birth,
With my works to the world.
