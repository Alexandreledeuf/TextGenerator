Have no doubt
When we talk about
Death is certain
We want it to come without pain
Each soul has to depart
As we are part
Of the divine theory
And put in motion already
Whether you like it or not
The solution has to be sought
The life is to be spent in orderly manner
Not to side with evil or sin culture
You shall have choice
When raise voice
About your past and present
You acted as messenger sent from above
Such belief makes you carefree
You have no reason to worry
As each passenger has to get down
When the destination is already known
The death may knock
In the early morning when warned by cock
As raising alarm over the appearance of death God
To take you away and free from load
