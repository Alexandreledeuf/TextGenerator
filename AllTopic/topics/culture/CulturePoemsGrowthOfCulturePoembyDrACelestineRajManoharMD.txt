Culture’s growth in leaps and bounds,
Must bring it out of its own cage or shell,
To adapt itself to environs new,
Taking the warning of self-destruction,
And relinquish its innate demerits
And primitive principles that elude
Its metamorphosis, remaining fresh
Like a jewel upon the keeper’s hand.
