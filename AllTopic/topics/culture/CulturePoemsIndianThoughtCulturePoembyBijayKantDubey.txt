Indian thought and culture and tradition,
Try I to charter their course
From the very beginning to down the ages
Going in my own way
Of dwelling upon the topic
And deliberating upon.
What it is Indian culture, the ingredients of it,
How is it one from Mount Kailash and Mansarovar
To the fringe of Tamil Nadu,
What to include, what to exclude,
Why not to be incorporating of all,
Indian and non-Indian, Aryan and non-Aryan?
Indian thought and culture is like the Ganges
Flowing down to
From the place of origin which lies it into the Himalayas
To the Gangasagar Islands,
An amalgamation of different cultures,
Creeds and sects
Aligning in the end.
