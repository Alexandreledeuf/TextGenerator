A singer of heart
Of love and joy
Setting words to music,
Giving music to words
By strumming,
Strumming and plucking
And plucking
The wires,
Wires of the guitar,
Bob,
Bob Dylan
A singer of heart,
A guitarist
Pop, jazz and blue
Remixing it all
In the tradition,
Symbolic of the great tradition
Of the American music
Folksy, remixes of the modern and the contemporary
And experimental
Bodily or soul-alluring,
Mundane nor transcendental,
Metaphysical or romantic.
