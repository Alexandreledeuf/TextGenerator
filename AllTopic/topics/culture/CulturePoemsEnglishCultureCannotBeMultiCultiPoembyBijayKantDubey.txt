English culture is English,
Typically British, American,
European and Christian,
Let it be British,
Let it be American,
Let the spirit not die,
Leaving no room,
Making no scope for multi-culti
As it cannot be multi-cultural,
Asiatic and aboriginal,
Exotic and diverse,
Ismic and conflicting.
England is England,
America America,
Let them be
With their cultures,
O Asians, destroy it not!
