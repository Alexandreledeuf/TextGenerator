Gun culture
Life is moving very fast
We don't know when will it last
but it is going to mushroom
we will watch growing crime in our room
yes drug trafficking is on
daily new methods are thrust on
the kids are inducted
for trade to be facilitated
they get killed or kill
this is not their will
but new style is added
the crime has flourished
soon you will witness
and find gloom on face
to find our dear one is shot dead
the culprits have then fled
you have new culture
to the future scene
the kids will be seen
yielding and showing gun
