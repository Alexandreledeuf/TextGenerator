A fascinating idea
if defines divinity in terms of humanity,
either by scriptural songs or
in scientific norms-
we see, religions are cultures` repetition,
veil in divine sensations.
Graciously it shaped and retains the life`s string:
from Indus to Nile and from Euphrates to Olympus.
For ages it has blessed this savage creature with faith,
morality and compassion, And consoles human temptations.
Scriptures, though sacred (but fishy too) , surely yielded  from old folk's rhymes.
A highly affected mechanism, that synced
our dreams with rituals, that heals.(believers claim)
Neither hell nor heaven, and no
Armageddon nor any doomsday,
But all are fancies and scribbles
that surely fret if you gonna play.
