Modern Indian English poetry represents it not
India,
Indian thought, culture and philosophy,
Myth and mysticism,
Metaphysics, spirituality and metaphysics,
Faith, belief and doubt.
Modern Indian English poetry represents it not
India,
The India of the countryside,
The villages, thorps and hamlets of it,
Meadows, pastures, deserts and hilly terrains,
The exotic flora and fauna of it,
The hills, vales and dales.
But the modern men the hollow men doing tidbits,
Trifle and trivial things,
The modern hollow men,
The modern city men of the city culture and living,
The modern urban men of the cityscape
For whom life is a visit to the bazaar
And men as market-goers, shoppers.
Pizzas, plazas, parks, pubs, picnics, parties,
Malls, cafes, coffee houses, restaurants,
Multi-complexes, gyms, over bridges, jams, flyovers,
Tours and travels,
Style, fashion and designing,
Tension and stress management,
The talks of the modern poets as the modern men,
The modern city men living in towns and cities,
Mega cities and metropolitan towns.
