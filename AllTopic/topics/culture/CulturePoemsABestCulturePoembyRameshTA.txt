Flowers are the smiles of plants and trees
Like the morning Sunshine creates brightness!
Sweet smiles of everyone is the bright side of one
That should not be hidden from the public's eye;
For, that brightness spreads through all everywhere.
Culture is to greet all with a smile despite difficulty
Thereby sorrowfulness of one can be transformed
And the ideas got out of conversation may change all;
Gloominess can be turned into brightness in life.
The purpose of festivals and celebrations do that well!
Love of kind words brings about change unprecedented
Whose influence begins with a smile at first to influence all
To smile too and whose infection increases health of life;
This is the culture humanity needs to be nurtured ever!
