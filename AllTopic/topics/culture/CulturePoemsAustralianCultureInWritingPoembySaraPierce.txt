Hear the steak sizzle
And the beer fizzle,
A hit of beach cricket
Oh, what a wicket!
Under the burning sun
Weâ€™ll have a lot of watery fun
A cricket, AFL or Rugby game
Players celebrated in a hall of fame
All cultures together as one
Yet, individual until the game is won.
The days of old
Like the rush for gold
The love of everyone
After wars and battles
The drovers with cattle
The brumbies in the mountains high
With all our dreams to fly
