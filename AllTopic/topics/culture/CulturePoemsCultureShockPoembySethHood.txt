I know its summer,
But all i can think is fall.
In the yard there is no lumber,
And on the trees the leaves are there in all.
All i see are fallen leaves:
Of yellow, orange, and red.
Yet the wind never heaves
And the birds still aren't fed
School isn't in yet
But it's just round the corner,
So I have a lot to fret
At the school where I'll be a foreigner.
I feel the rush,
And all the kids in the hall,
A pretty girl with a brush
And a nerd about to fall.
Sitting all alone,
Surrounded by strangers
I'm not accident prone,
Yet all around dangers
Not a familiar face in sight,
Or an inside joke to tell,
I look everywhere and see fright
All people have are lies to sell.
They feed off fear.
And inhale the pain.
They give you an evil lear.
Say your resilience is in vain.
No sympathaty at all,
Or even mercy,
Although I stand tall
But they're all bloodthirsty.
They look at me and whisper,
Ugly things they say.
Hatred inside her
I try to say I'm okay.
Power in numbers,
Yet im all alone.
While the great beast slumbers,
I look at my phone.
Nothing.
Its the way it is.
Coping.
But I still fizz.
