~ Cell ~ Soul ~ Culture ~ [1+26 words poetry]

Cell ~ Culture
Is mundane splendor.
Soul ~ Culture
Is self unfolder.
Discover Soul
In unique unison
With ev'ry being
Identify
E'er new Whole
Thro' wizardry of
Omnipresent oxyopia!

Glossary: Humbly given for what I tried to express: ~
[1] Oxyopia: Acute vision
