Indian culture is the best like gold.
India  hath  need of  cultured men.
A gun or bomb may convert into a pen.
Educated  men  have  a  royal  hold.
All women must be literate and bold.
And all dress as  per  their  religions.
Way of living depends upon their regions.
Old is  gold  as  we have  been  told.
We all live here with our fore - fathers!
But  we  think  as  lucky  and  blessed.
AS the citizen of India we are addressed.
By humanity sake we Indian help to others.
So as  all  the  states  are  our  brothers.
In the golden words Indian culture is expressed.
