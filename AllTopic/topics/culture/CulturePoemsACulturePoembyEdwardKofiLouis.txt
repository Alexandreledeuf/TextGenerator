You are 20 miles away from wisdom and,
I am 60 miles awy from you with the facts of life;
And like the little doctrines and the rules which may delay a culture,
For hatred is also in our own rooms and on our own tables.
Real or artificial to you may sound as if to crown the muse,
But do walk around the town to see things for yourselves;
And of an education of words without the broom!
Let wisdom reign to the charging of mankind.
You are satisfied with yourself and i am with my muse also,
But a culture of value is what i need;
For you've been delayed by the doctrines of your culture in this life!
