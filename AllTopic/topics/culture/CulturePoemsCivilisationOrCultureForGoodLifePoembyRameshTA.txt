Best way of living is called culture varying from place to place;
Based on experience knowledge of better living helps a way
To be followed for living a satisfied and lasting life of fun here!
Modern life based on civilisation allows much room for freedom;
But lack of culture only classifies them under gypsy category!
Modern people rely on money believing it as a mark of civilisation
To live independently without giving importance to human beings!
But by the very nature of birth man is incomplete without company
And that makes man live in family rather than alone as an animal
That roams about in search of food and mate to satisfy its needs!
However many go by money to live mechanical life without risks
That helps one as long as health and strength are in good state;
But once they become weak by age and canâ€™t manage alone
They long for love, family and children by their side till the end!
