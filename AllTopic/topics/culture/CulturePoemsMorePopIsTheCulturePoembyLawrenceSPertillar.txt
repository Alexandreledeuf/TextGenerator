More POP is the culture.
Given more significance to it meant.
And getting more POP is a culture,
Feasting on decadence.
And 'blinging' things that make no sense.
Getting more POP is a culture,
And given more significance.
But,
Losing ground is sanity,
Invented to dispense.
Oh yes more POP is the culture.
Fed to deadened heads.
Oh yes more POP is the culture.
And given more significance.
But,
Losing ground is sanity,
Invented to dispense.
Oh yes more POP is the culture.
Worship it or leave.
Oh yes more POP is the culture.
In heads to believe.
Oh yes more POP is the culture.
Fed to deadened heads.
Oh yes more POP is the culture.
And given more significance.
But,
Losing ground is sanity,
Invented to dispense.
More POP is the culture.
And given a significance meant.
Oh yes more POP is the culture.
And 'blinging' things that make no sense.
More more more POP is the culture.
And given a significance meant.
Oh yes more POP is the culture.
And 'blinging' things that make no sense.
More POP as a culture.
I want it as a need.
More more more POP as a culture.
I need it give it please.
Give me more POP as a culture.
I want it as a need.
More more more POP as a culture.
I need it give it please.
