A mother worries about the choices that her son may make.
She knows she has let him make decisions for his own sake.
As sirens scream, a mother sits in darkness choking back tears.
She prays that her boy is safe and calms her doubting fears.
At half past two, beams from headlights flood the driveway.
Relieved that he is home, she tiptoes to her bedroom right away.
She hears an urgent knocking and goes to turn on the porch light.
Patiently waiting at the door is a police officer; he is a somber sight.
