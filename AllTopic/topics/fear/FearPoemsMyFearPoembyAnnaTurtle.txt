Do you want to know,
What I fear the most?
It isn’t a vampire,
Nor a ghost.
For the werewolf's claw,
I do not hide,
The banshee and I,
Walk side by side.
I chat with the witch,
About cook recipes,
Not even the monsters,
I do despise.
No only one thing,
Do fear with a passion,
No, it’s not girls,
Who’re too into fashion.
I fear for to be lonely,
Without family and friends,
If they were all gone,
The my life would end.
