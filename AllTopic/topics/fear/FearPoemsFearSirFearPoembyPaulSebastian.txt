That arresting fear!
That crippling fear!
That haunting fear!
Spirit wrecking fear!
Fear of loss of love
You court broken hearts
Accompany the rejected
Celebrate loss of loved ones
Before you many die defeated
Fear of failure
You cleverly drown success
Whispering believable doubts
Thief of dream-chests
You tout dreamers’ walkouts
Fear of poverty
You chain the poor in misery
Kill off initiatives, ambition
Feed worry and uncertainty
Bring indecision and procrastination
Fear of Criticism
You work on self-doubts
Wreck self-esteem
Make-believe what others thought
You kill possible dreams
Fear of ill-health and death
You wait with scythe at hell’s door
Lure weaklings into traps of wealth
Peddle illnesses, deaths your score
Devastate families, sell your wreaths
Fear of old age
You breed insecurity of dependence
Steal pride and honour
You rob freedom, after-life assurance
Bring on old-age wine’s stupor
I fear you, Sir Fear
You, father of lies
Father of all fears
Who marries you, dies!
