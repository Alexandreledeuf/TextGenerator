Fear not the storms in their darkest hour
Fear opens doors so evil can devour
Fear not the dark ways which lurk around
Fear takes your joy and chains you bound
Fear not the morning as you awake
Fear creates disorder thatâ€™s no mistake
Fear not the troubles that cross your path
Fear can dismantle you with its wrath
Fear not those things in all you do
Fear has no home when Christ Jesus is in you
