When life becomes a trembling world of fear,
you question every single move you make,
afraid your loving soul will disappear;
for danger looms, awaiting your mistake.
What hidden word will cause explosion's might
to back you in a corner of despair?
Your sole reprieve lies in the ebon night,
yet anger boils from pain he wouldn't spare.
Where love once dwelled resides a burning hate
as desperation's hand has gained control.
No longer viewed as your eternal mate;
to save yourself becomes the utmost goal.
Envisioning a pool of crimson red;
a knife within your hand; your fear is shed.
