Fear is just in
Your mind
Focus on what
Your doing
Then you’ll notice
Your not afraid
If your not afraid
Of death why be
Afraid of any thing else
To conquer your fears
Confront them
If it heart break
Lose the love of your life
But it will be hard to go alone
But if you ever notice you’ve
Always been alone
No one there to help ease
The pain
That’s why I go down the path of hate now
My fear is to love again
