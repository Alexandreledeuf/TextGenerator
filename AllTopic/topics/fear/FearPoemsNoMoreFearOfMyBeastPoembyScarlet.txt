for I no longer fear my beast
I will not try to hide it anymore
I will no longer lock it inside
for I will not fear what is within me anymore
I will no longer fear what they created
I will embrace my beast
I will learn how to control it
instead of it controlling me
I will use it to break down the wall
the wall Iâ€™m trapped behind
I will use it so I can be seen
for when I embraced it
I became in control
for when I embraced it
it became part of me
it works with me now
not against me
it helps me over come my obstacles
I myself don't have the strength for
for it will teach me ways to release my anger
instead of bottling it up
