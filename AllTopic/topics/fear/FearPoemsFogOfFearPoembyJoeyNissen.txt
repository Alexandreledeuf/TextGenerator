The fear swells up
I begin to dread
That time in my life
That my life will end
The fog gets so thick
I can barely see
My brain starts to wonder
What will happen to me
I look over my shoulder
But no one is there
I could die right now
But I just don't care
Inside my chest
My heart begins to race
The end is so near
It's right in my face
The fear swells up
I begin to dread
That time in my life
That my life will end
