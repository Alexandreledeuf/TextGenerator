Powerful, that’s right,
I’m a terror, as you will see, no one can beat me.
Why I’ll tear you apart from top to bottom.
I won’t give a damn, winter, spring, summer or autumn.
If you cross me, I’ll mow you down
like a huge caterpillar machine right to the ground.
I’m bigger than life, full of horror and strife.
I’ll take all you’ve got, even your life.
Friends-no, not your mother
your father,  nor your sister or brother.
Strong, powerful, big and fearless.
Your worst enemy, listen and hear this,
be alert, drug free, your mind must be clear
or you’ll be dealing with me out there.
I don’t care about your friends or your loving family.
I’ve been known to bring death to those who mock me.
So pick up your socks and take heed, or those
you love will fall in need.
I’m here, there and everywhere.
Don’t worry, prejudice you will not find.
I want all, young, old, rich, poor.
You can all come screaming through my door.
I’ve killed more people than you can imagine.
so c’mon working class, learn your trade,
be the best that you can be, and take top grades.
For those who excel, will certainly exceed.
Never become victim to my selfish greed.
They call me
“CARELESSNESS”
This is dedicated to my son 'John' and all men and women
who drive big machinery or big rigs.
