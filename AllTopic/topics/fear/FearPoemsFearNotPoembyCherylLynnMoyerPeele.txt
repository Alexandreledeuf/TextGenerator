Once again Einstein rules
the universe, this time
his 'dark energy' viewed
through Hubble's eyes
expanding galaxies
laughing at gravity
moving celestial matter
expo-nentially, look out
nothing will collide, neither
planets, nor our stars
can hesitate, space
wrinkles invisible, unfelt
thundering senseless
skies into once nowhere
now arriving daily
to a reality near you.
