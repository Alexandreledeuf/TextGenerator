Why you've fear,
When I'm here?
Why shed a tear,
I'm not clear?
You're every year,
Grown up in fear,
That brings you tear,
When you aren't clear.
Show always a cheer,
In place of a tear,
That will, my dear,
Drive away your fear.
If still you've fear,
When I'm near,
You turn deaf ear,
To my words, dear.
I'm now clear,
That you've no fear,
Nor let a tear,
Down below your ear.
