Fear is an agonizing thing
It cripples deep inside
It freezes the thinking part of you
So you want to run and hide
It creeps like a burglar upon you
Causing shivers to run down your spine
It reduces you to an empty shell
And destroys all that is fine
Don't let fear get a hold on you
Fight it with all your might
Once you bring that fear in the open
Your world has a chance to be bright
