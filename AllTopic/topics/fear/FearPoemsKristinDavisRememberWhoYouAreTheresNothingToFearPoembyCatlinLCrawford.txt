I know the fear within you aches
It captivates your mind
But I know you have what it takes
Though you fear you're walking blind
But walking blinds a good thing
Walk by faith and not by sight
With faith you can conquer anything
But the void of faith is fright
Remember, you have nothing to fear
This battle is God's fight too
And He's never lost a fight, my dear
So why would he start with you?
Remember the Warrior you are
The leader of them all
God heard our war cries from afar
And now beside us he's fighting tall
God is with you now and tomorrow
And forever till forever's end
Please don't let life bring you sorrow
Because in God you've found a friend
Please listen to my words
Listen and hold them dear
God is Lord of lords
And with him, there's nothing to fear
