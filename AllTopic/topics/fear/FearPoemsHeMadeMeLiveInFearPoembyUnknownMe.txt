No one really knows
What happens inside the room
As he locks the door
He’ll ask me to lie in bed
And when I rebuff
A slap will hit my face
I’ll give in loosing my strength
Coz I’ll meet my death
If refuse to be good in bed
For how many years
I lived in fear
With torn self-esteem
One day I had the courage
To call for a quit
But I was outraged
A flying kick here
A rushing punch there
Luckily I got help
I was totally devastated
Hurt physically
But hurt more emotionally
Good thing he never came back
But still threatening me
To kill me when he is back
Many years have passed
The fear was still carried
Wish that fear can be buried
