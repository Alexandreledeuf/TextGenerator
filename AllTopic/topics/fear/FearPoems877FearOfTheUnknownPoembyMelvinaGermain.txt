The wind was strong and the dust blew viciously.
Walking on a dirt road, not sure of my destination.
I encountered a coyote standing in the distance. My
first thought was to turn and run and then I
realized that might not be a good idea.  I slowly
walked, placing one foot quietly in front of the
other, while keeping my eye on the coyote.  The
animal did not move, it stood in the same position.
Fearful as I was, I didn’t want the animal to know
my fear.  I bravely took step after step and walked
toward the road.  Finally I reached a crossing in
the road.  When I turned to look back the coyote
was gone.  At that point, I felt sure I was safe and
continued to walk down the road.  When I
approached an old shack at the road clearing, I
noticed paw prints on the soft ground.  Immediately
I thought, what animal made those prints, surely
it wasn’t the coyote that I encountered earlier,
certainly not, don’t be silly I thought to myself.
Once again I continued to walk forward.  I could
feel butterflies in my stomach.  What were those
prints on the ground.  Trying not to think about it,
I began to walk faster and faster.  Suddenly I
heard a noise, it sounded like a scratching noise
behind me.  Oh what now, could that be the
coyote.  My heart was racing and the sweat
poured down my face causing my eyes to sting.
My vision blurred by my perspiration, I was beside
myself and was feeling very  sick to my stomach.
Never before, have I been so afraid, never so unsure
of myself.  I wanted to run, but once again
wondered if the animal that was following me
might run and attack me.
