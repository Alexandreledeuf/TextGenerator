Fear, an emotion easily obtained,
Something we dread, or maybe of shame,
Fear for a life, or sickness within,
Emotions obtained, but difficult to contain.
An emotion in life, one we all share,
Fear of the unknown, fear of pain,
Fear of embarrassment, fear of death
No one likes it, but itâ€™s always there.
So difficult to understand, often we may never,
To learn to accept, when others may not,
An emotion of agony and always pain,
A feeling of despair, yet so difficult to sever
Yet,  with the pain, help is there,
The friends we have, to help us through,
The faith we have, to pave the way,
To help us through, from those who care.
