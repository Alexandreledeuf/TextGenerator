Fear of the unknown
is what makes me behind
Fear of tomorrow
is what makes me blind
Fear of the darkness
is what makes me seek the light
Fear of losing
is what makes me fight
Fear of pain
is what makes me insane
Fear of getting crushed
is what makes me struggle in vain
Fear of punishment
is what makes me flee
Fear of beasts
is what makes me a prey
Fear of destiny
is what makes me pray
Fear of time
is what makes my life a day
Fear of truth
is what makes me lie
Fear of life
is what makes me die
Fear of Fear
is what makes my life..
Too drear! !
