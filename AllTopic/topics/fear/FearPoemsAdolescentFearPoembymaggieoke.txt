Adolescent fear never speaks in its own language
Always translated into the impure tongue
Of cocky
Mock confidence
Mutating into
Terrifying others
But not me
Each morning resolute to spread a little knowledge
Inspire a little, fighting another tide
Which is pulling them
Each morning they arrive resolute to fit in
Look cool
Be popular
Stay safe
A handy tool
Is mock the teacher
Show no interest
In the offerings
Of knowledge
And inspiration
Let battle of two tides commence
