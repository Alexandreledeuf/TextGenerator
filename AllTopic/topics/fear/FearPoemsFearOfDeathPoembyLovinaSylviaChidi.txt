In death we die alone
to dust and bone
we return to take our
rightful place on earths throne
Dying of an endless cancer
Whispers on the cold clay earth
A stillness in the air
Filled by sudden fear
When the shadows of darkness
are knowingly very near
A stillness in the air
Filled by sudden fear
Whats next, When and where
Curiosity of thoughts
above or beyond
A heart beats endlessly
pondering on what is out there
which remains a mystery
