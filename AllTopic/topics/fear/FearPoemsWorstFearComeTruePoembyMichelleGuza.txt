Cold tears plunging from the eyes that are forever lost
Making no since and trying to make it through
Its just not the same..not with out you
I’m not perfect and you never cared
Every pain, dream, and secret is all we shared
Laughing all day just to forget what we went through
I know this laughter is fake but what else can I do
The small things remind me such as a picture in a frame
But we both know that it will never be the same
I need my sister and i’m telling you all
don’t ever your sister fall
The pain of losing you sister is so much more
Something that no teenager should indoor
Wipe the tears off my face and try to make it look like I can keep on going
But I don’t know how much of this fake joy I can keep showing
don’t ever lose your sister and keep her near
Teach your sister how to love and how to always be dear
And to my sister, Chelsi this is for you
I hope no one will take in my worst fear come true! !
