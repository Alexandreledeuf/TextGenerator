It is in the small things we see it
A spider in the corner
A hairy monster on the prowl
Lighting  on a dark night
A flash of ligh that brings a scream of rage
A new room filled with the unknown
The staring faces and smug looks of others
Later
If you return with a knowledge packed head
You do it with the dreaded anticipation of the day ahead
You do it hiding from the monsters
The laughing monsters of pain and hurt
You do it as a black shadow
Flickering between the light and the dark
Later
If you survived the hell of a thousand faces
You emerge with painful memories
But also with a hope of a new life
This is short lived
The stacking of bills
A never ending stream of debt
The dark monster trying to steal a loved one away
Emerging behind words of pain and hurt
Smothering your dwindling hope
Later
After a life fully lived
Your fear is in the struggle to stand
In the winter
The horrific beauty of the ice
In the Last sickness of your life
