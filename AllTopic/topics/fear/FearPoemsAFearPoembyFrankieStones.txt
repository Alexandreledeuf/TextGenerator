I didn't know what to do,
I was trapped,
A prisoner,
A slave,
I had nowhere to run,
Nowhere to hide,
Nowhere to go,
And nowhere to cry,
I'm all alone in this world
I have no shoulder to cry on,
No person to love,
Nothing to look forward to,
Yet I go on,
I live my life
In fear of everything,
I fear I will never find love,
I will never feel the warmness inside,
That I long to feel,
The warm touch of someone close,
That I wish to feel,
I will never find,
That I will always love,
The soul mate,
I'm always thinking of.
What is there left in this world for me?
Nothing or is it just worth waiting,
Just to see,
What might happen?
And will I ever become free.
