Rainy days and stormy nights
a train running through my mind
tree's fall knocking out the lights
and I somehow, lose all track of time
I sat there in that corner all alone
wondering what will happen next
praying that he didn't come home
I was wrong, now I'm in a hell of a fix
I heard her tell him, I got beat up bad
he had to come and look for himself
when he saw me crying he did get mad
after that beating, all I thought of was death
I was always wrong because he had his own rule
and no matter what I did, it just wasn't enough
I even had thoughts of camping out at school
because living at home was getting to be rough
I use to cry a lot, but I got broke in with pain
it's hard to do at time, and I can't understand
holding the tears all the years who can explain
he walked around, proudly calling himself a man
He just didn't know what I had been thinking
pay him back for all the pain that he gave me
wait till he passed out from all the drinking
could burn the house down and I would be free
It's sad to think of all the pain a child gets
so hard to deal with and seems no one cares
they go through this life with so many regrets
from living in shame and hiding from fear
when will it ever stop?
