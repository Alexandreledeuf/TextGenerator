I fear not of tomorrow
The dark scares me not
I am not full of sorrow
Although I've weeped a lot
What I fear is not on paper
There are no words big enough
I am not a hater
Although this world can be so tough
What I fear is much deeper
It is not simply cold or hot
What makes me a weeper
Is the fear of loosing all I've got
It's the fear of fear itself
That keeps me up at night
The fear of fear itself
Is what keeps happiness out of my sight
It's the fear of putting all plans on the shelf
That makes me afraid of loosing my very self
The fear of scaring away
Who I am inside
Is what makes me
So afraid I hide
