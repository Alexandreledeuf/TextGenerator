Fear
An emotional preparedness
To face an eventuality
To manage an unacceptable development
To negotiate with a less amenable group
Fear is weakness, some say
Fear is strength, some other say
Fear often is quoted as reason
For our doing something or not doing
The nature and extent of fear
Are based on self-experienced earlier occasions
And sometimes on others' experience
A close examination will reveal
We fear not the event or the situation
But its impacts
On our financial, professional, social standing
Fear forms the spark for insurance
Which ensures at least the financial imbalance
Gets rectified to an extent
While experience paves way for fear
Non-experience knows no or less fear
Over-experience also makes one fearless
Fear also indicates
Our preparedness to see things go right
If fear is weakness
Fearlessness can prove dangerous
Basically we need to fear
But this should not stop us from going ahead
Fear, but venture with proven precautions
Know well in advance the impacts
Plan adequately to meet the consequences
Never ever arrogate yourself to fearlessness
Fear not fear
But fear fearlessness
