What if your enemy just follows you,
And monitors your rise most shamelessly;
Beware and keep away from such men too,
Who love to hound good men relentlessly.
What if your friends have become foes, whole-lot?
You live in solitude, no soul to talk!
Much noise emanates from an empty pot!
Don’t ever turn back; just continue your walk.
What if the mighty Satan chases you,
From place to place, pillar to post, endless?
Ignore his calls, appearing calm; just do
Right things, the harder way round with fairness.
When God’s with you, why should you ever fear?
He’s your Friend who cares- with heart and ear!
