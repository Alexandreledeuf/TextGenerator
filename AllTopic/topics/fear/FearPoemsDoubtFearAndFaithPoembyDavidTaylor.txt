I doubt you will read this
I don’t believe this is of any use
I can’t concede this is a worthy verse
I don’t think I could do any worse
I never will be right
When I just can’t see any light
When I am so unclear
When I am far from your love
When I am gripped by fear
I never will be true
If I do not have faith in You.
