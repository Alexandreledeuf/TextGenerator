I smell it here, I smell it near
In our hearts, body and soul we wear
Fear! Year in and year out in full gear
Fear of death
Fear of rejection
Fear of loneliness
Fear of poverty
I hear it near, it stinks of hell my dear
In our hearts, body and soul we wear
Fear! Year in and year out in full gear
At times overwhelming and impossible to bear
Fear of being ridiculed
Fear of being single
Fear of being truthful
Fear of life always holding on to survive
Fear of change and what surprises it sprinkles
Fear of old age painted with priceless wrinkles
Let me tell it like Shakespeare
And make it plain and clear
Listen why be afraid of fear?
When fear itself canâ€™t talk, walk, see nor hear!
