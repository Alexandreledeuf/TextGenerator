i do not fear....
Armagadden, not the end,
not soldiers wearing masks,
not the plague, not nuclear disaster....
not prisons, not persecution,
not being labeled or hated.
not losing it all,
not guns, not drugs, nor
one world order.....
but i do fear....
not living all that i can live,
not giving all that i can give,
not matching beliefs with action,
not seeing all people as people,
not doing what i know is right....
not standing when i should stand,
not saying what i should say....
not writing the words i'm given....
