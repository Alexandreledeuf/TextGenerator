That night I heard your voice
it woke me,
bolted through my body
like electricity does wet feet.
It was shocking,
I found myself
shivering in a cold sweat-
Unable to move to your side
for refuge,
my tongue went lifeless,
my lips sealed as if to kiss-
I swear I tried to save you.
The clock blurred in motion-
The night, hugged my insides so tightly
I fought to breathe.
I sought to rationalize the moment,
to make sense of the flies
motionless in the air-
why my hands were so invisible.
I rushed to your bedside
to find you
old and diseased-
I caressed your hand,
accepting the truth:
eventually, no matter how unfair
someday all mothers die-
even when there are torn hemlines
and broken children
in need of mending.
