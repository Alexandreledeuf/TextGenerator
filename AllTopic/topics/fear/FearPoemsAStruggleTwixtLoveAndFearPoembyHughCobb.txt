Too oft in time
it seems a crime
to open up one's heart.
Comes into play
that which  we fear,
from which we run away:
the fear that love will soon depart
& all abandon'd shall we be:
alone forevermore, drowning in a sea
of pain, remorse & self-pity.
So heed me well! Listen here.
Love comes not with a guarantee.
My friend, 'tis gamble all or none!
But if your fears do keep you safe,
you'll miss out on all the joy & fun
that risk & love alone can bring.
So take a chance!
Don't be a waif.
Let your heart dance
& spirit sing.
Love now, love more today!
