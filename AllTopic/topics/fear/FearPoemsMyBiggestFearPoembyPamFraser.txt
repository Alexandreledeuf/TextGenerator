I have this feeling it’s called fear
I  have the fear of who will be dying or will I be next?
If  I stop think about “how can I have myself prepare? “.
This fear is consuming me.
It’s like stealing something from me.
I don’t know what it is….
How to deal with it
I want to see it........
Can anyone help me to see?
Does this feeling go away?
Are these feelings real or  fake.
I  also have a fear of not achieving my dreams
That  thought makes me want to scream.
I have Fear of my life.Every day that’s not much
I could say on that, I try give it my strife
The real world gives me fear too.
Sometimes, “I wish everything would disappear
Instead appear into fear”.
The Fear of losing my mother before I am ready to let her go.
What road do I take so I won’t let fear win.
Fear takes my thoughts of losing my husband, and
losing one of my children too.
Even though, I almost did loose a child.
I can let the fear, do what it is doing..
I fear of losing my dearest friend.
I am sorry I cant pretend that fear is not here.
The fear of my own death and the cause of it will be?
I don’t want to see.
The fear of my lifestyle should  it be  the way it should be lived?
or should it be change?
Do I dear change it, but how?
I know that I have a fear of being alone.
It’s the unknown
Is My Biggest Fear
