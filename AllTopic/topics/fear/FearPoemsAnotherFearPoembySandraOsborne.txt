Drunk and wanting to be higher
Another drink, can’t find my smokes
Always wanting more from fire,
To much rebellion from my folk’s.
It’s hard to drink and not to care,
It’s hard to climb the loving stairs.
It’s hard to feel my love break through
Just never felt it much from you.
It’s a hardened life
In cold and pain,
It’s a lonely faith,
I feel the same.
Don’t ask me why I have to write,
So many told me “Girl, just fight”
With the inspiration flooding through,
Spilling and drowning in it’s flight.
So leave me be,
You’re not my foe,
You’re another fear,
That I don’t know.
