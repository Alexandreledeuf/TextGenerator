I greet the burden of your soul
and wonder if your heart is whole
when one can hold it out to share
beware of love, beware.
From all this wretched hardship take
a lesson for your wisdom's sake
the future holds its sorrow's share
beware of love, beware.
A last and thoughtful parting word
to one whose broken dreams are heard
take comfort in the moment here
where you can love without the fear.
Fear not to love, Fear not!
