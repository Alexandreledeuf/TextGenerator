Just feel full of fear.
Time for that cold beer.
Find a friend with big ears.
Wont cring at my fears.
Cimb into that nest high.
After a few, then that sigh.
What keeps this liquid cold.
Drinking fast and not too slow.
Crazy how life just goes.
That guys got a funny nose.
Onward the march of day.
Over the bar, another days pay.
What can I do but cry.
So its time to say goodbye.
