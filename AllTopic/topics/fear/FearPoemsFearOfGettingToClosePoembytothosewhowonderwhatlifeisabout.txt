People choose to see what
they want in me
wanting to be my friend
seeking the knoweldge I
hold within from what
I have learned in school
and outside of school
Never really touching
what I am made up of on the inside
but if they ask, I tell them some
but nothing to deep
for I feel once they know
who I am on the inside
they will no longer be my friend
For they always want
people to know them inside and out
For me it takes either along time
or a very strong  conection between
me and that person
before I let them know
my deepest darkest secrets
that lay deep beneath my skin
with the hope that they will
still be my friend
