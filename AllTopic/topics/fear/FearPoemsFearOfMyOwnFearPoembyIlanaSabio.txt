Is it possible to have one fear?
Can you be afraid of fear?
Am I hidding in the shadow of fear?
I can standup for myself but can't stand up to me
I'm scared of being scared
I want to find myself facing my fears
Diving head first into danger
But don't want to hesitate knowing,
fear itself might hold me back.
Grasping me tightly until I fear all that is known
Scared of dark corners, creaking noises.
All together I still fear, fear the most.
