Do you see the window,
.....underneath the tree?
Do you see the sunshine
.....floating on the sea?
Do you feel the laughter
.....over at the bar?
Do you feel the pain
.....of the rusting car?
Do you understand the world?
.....Ask if you are real.
Do you understand our time?
.....Can you even feel.
Do you know the answers?
.....There are no questions here.
Do you know why we hate?
There exists inside us fear.
