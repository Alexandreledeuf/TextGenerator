The beating of your heart when you know somethings wrong.
Why you hide from everything but think you're so strong.
Why you can't take chances and stay on the safe side.
Why you never sit in the front seat, or go on Six Flags rides.
Why you don't leave the house, even when you want to.
Why you don't have many friends to talk to you.
As Scared, Anxious and Modest as you appear, people think you're crazy, all I see is Fear.
