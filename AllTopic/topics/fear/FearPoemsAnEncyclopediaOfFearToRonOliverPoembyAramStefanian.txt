There's primal fear like a fetus blinded by daylight
There's lingering fear like a zit growing on your nose
There's groundless fear like a dark day covered by a clear night
There's inarticulate fear like a little fish wolfed down by a shark
There's sudden fear like a demon startled by an unfamiliar ghost
There's mortal fear like a soul baffled by heavenly hell
There's fake fear like a popstar blowing his/her lines
There's undying fear like boomerang returning to hit you hard
There's cryptic fear like a stranger ringing at your doorbell
There's fatal fear like falling prey to a predator
There's introverted fear we've invented by ourselves
And have to live with it.
