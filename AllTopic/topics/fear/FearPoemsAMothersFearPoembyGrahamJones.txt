Children in the playground
Children in the park
Never leave a child alone
To wander in the dark
The world is full of demons
Some real some make believe
That wear the cloak of decency
Like a weapon to deceive
Predators that stalk the land
Their hearts and souls defiled
To destroy the face of innocence
Of one that is a child.
