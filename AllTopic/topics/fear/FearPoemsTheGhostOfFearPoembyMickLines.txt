The Ghost of Fear
Oh! What a terrible demon am I
Invading your thoughts, infecting your lives
Making you think twice, hesitate and stress
Causing self doubt and making you less
What will they say, Oh! What will ensue?
My Mother, the Vicar, the children and you?
And what of the neighbours, what will they do?
Their curtains are twitching, eyes peeking through
Can I afford it, is it too dear?
My purse strings are stretching… breaking I fear!
But, she’s a Blackman, but he’s a girl!
This is not natural
Very strange world!
Is it too late? Do I have time?
Perhaps I should leave it
At this age of mine
Is it too sweet, is it too fat?
Should I enjoy it?
I couldn’t do that!
My hips are too big, my bum is too fat
My legs are too skinny
My boobs are too flat!
Is it still safe, is it secure?
Can I still trust it?
I’m not so sure
So, throughout your life I constantly speak
Holding you back, so humble so meek
When will you realise God gave you a choice
And open yourself to that sure inner voice
But oh! You’re so weak of poor human seed
And I’m happy you stay so
For I continue to feed!
