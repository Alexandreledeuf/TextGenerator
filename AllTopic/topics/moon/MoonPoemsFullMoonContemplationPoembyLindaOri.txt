It's said the moon has power over man -
It governs our body mechanisms,
Rising and falling biorhythms,
Lunar months during pregnancy,
And it plays with our minds:
The full moon is captivating -
Rising as a ball of orange light in the fall,
Blazing brilliant white on a winter night
Enhancing the stars in their midnight glory
And bathing the earth below in stark half-light:
It mesmerizes lovers and dreamers,
Promises miracles to those who pray,
Agitates the mentally unstable mind,
Inspires the poet to creat beautiful words,
And interrupts our sleep with its magical glow;
It beckons us to exlore its mysteries -
A lucky few have walked its surface
Leaving footprints for future explorers to follow,
Always it appears as a beacon of steadfastness,
An anchor that tethers this unstable planet.
A beautiful sight on a black onyx night.
