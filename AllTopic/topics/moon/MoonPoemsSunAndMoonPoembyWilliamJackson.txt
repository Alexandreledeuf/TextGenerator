Sun and Moon
Wishful lovers
Never touch
Languish in silence
Throughout space & time.
She, a fiery siren,
Shines out light,
Passionate love
Towards the object
Of her affection.
And he, the blue moon,
Desiring her caress
Casts his gaze
Upon her visage.
Yet both must find
Permanent satisfaction
With at best and most
Merely the reflection
Of her incandescence
Off his exquisite face.
