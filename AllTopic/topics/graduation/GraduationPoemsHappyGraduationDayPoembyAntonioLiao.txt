I waited for too long, guarded with much expectation
swings my life through rise and fall, until I conquer the
one I adore, the might of the grade raises me to go in
the paper record I knew I can be strong, project, field
trips and test makes it all, wow! its a graduation
packages deal everybody is called
long live the teacher, in every lines they watch it fall, the
reason waking until dawn melted candles and eyebrows
in the table ants eat them all, as the student always pray
to pass making them luck in the end wisdom and fate
leads its way, laughter, jokes and smiling sway every day
for itâ€™s the path to reach and catch every minutes and hour
of the day until the doorstep of the hall everybody love to
stay
mother and father watch as you walk in the pathways and
in the aisles you look like a baby as your smile in the
roof top, always make you happy, for graduation day your
friend and love one witness your beauty, just close and
breath as you could make it; the whole day is you to do
the best in you
see and reward the past, learn to vow the one you believe,
live the future and bring the past, know yourself forget the
wounded lies, be on guard the present is you to step, nay!
the future will come, for only the you is the one you adore
leave nothing that forget you, always be ready, only our love
will leads you in your way.....now go and Happy Graduation
Day.....in your life
