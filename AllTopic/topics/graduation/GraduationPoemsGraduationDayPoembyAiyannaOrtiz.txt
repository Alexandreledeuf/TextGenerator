Twelve years we have worked for this
day after day, year after year
Teachers filled are head with knowledge
most encouraged us to dream big
but our dreams can only be accomplished is
if we put our mind to it to make a better life for ourselves
no one is going to just hand you your delploma we most
work for it
the harder you work the easyer is it in the end
we work our butts off for twelve years
to wear a cap and gown and to walk across the stage
don't screw it up now!
