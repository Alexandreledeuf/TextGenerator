Lisa, today you’ve made us proud,
Proud, as proud can be,
For today, at the Barbican,
You’ve collected your Honour’s Degree.
A Degree in Graphic Design,
You’ve worked so hard to attain,
And the Standards you’ve set yourself,
Through Life, you should always maintain.
Put the Craft that you’ve learnt to good use,
Remember, put your Clients’ needs to the fore,
And then you will succeed in Life,
Dear Daughter, whom we do adore.
With Pride, we watched you receive
This Honour’s Degree today,
Watched by Family and Friends,
On this 29th November 2005 Tuesday.
