It's a time top rejoice on all your achievements
it's a time to look back on what you have done
it's a time to move forward
it's a time to realize you'll miss it so much
it's a time where you'll smile and cry both at the same time
it's a time to say goodbye to those who changed your life
it's a time to those you don't want to leave
it's a time of graduation
the day you've been waiting for
the day you worked so hard for
it's here
you made it finally
standing there in your cap and gown
friends and family looking on
with tears in their eyes
tears of happiness and pride
calling out your name
as you get your diploma
the biggest smile on your face
the ceremony is over
now time to party
be with friends and family
and know in your heart and mind
you made it
this moment belongs to the graduates
all graduates
young and old
from first grade to college
this moment is yours
be happy
be blessed
be ready for the rest of your life
