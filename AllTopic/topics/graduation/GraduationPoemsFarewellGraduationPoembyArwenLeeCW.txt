Time to leave the ivory tower
We shall climb higher and look further
We're leaving our salad days behind
and start chasing our dreams ahead
Give an embrace to the unknown future
Opportunities are always hidden in dangers
Lift our head and spread our wings
To touch the sky and reach the stars
The moments we spent together
The memories I'll always hold dear
Would it take long to recognise me
If we happened to meet after years?
