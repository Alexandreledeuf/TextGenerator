It's coming,
I can feel it.
Rushing at me,
like a tidal wave.
Soon,
free and independent.
I'll start a new story,
leave the old one behind.
Bring my favorite chapters with me,
leave the others alone.
When it comes then goes, I'll begin wondering,
what I'll do when I'm older.
I'll be happy it's finally over, until,
I'm realizing I'm crying,
my tears coming from the part of me who doesn't want to let go.
That doesn't want to leave behind all that's surrounded it for years,
But then, I'll remember all that's ahead of me,
an untold story waiting to be written still.
So, with a heavy heart, I'll move on,
Take my huge last step to the end,
and take my first step into my new beginning.
And experience a day,
my day,
called graduation.
