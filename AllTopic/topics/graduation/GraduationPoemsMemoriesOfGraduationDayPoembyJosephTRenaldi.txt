The heart leads back to Graduation Day,
to speakers addressing the graduates below,
to tales, excitement and joy shared.
and the face of proud parents set aglow.
A day when a graduate maybe a bit uneasy
and can't tolerate the end of an era anymore.
But, oh the merriment tucked inside -
Sweet memories of educational success and more.
A day when graduates have a flickering hope
and on their face they warmly portray -
peace to the heart, an inner glow.
and faith to enlighten the unknown way.
The heart leads back to struggles conquered,
making commencement such a memorable day.
Remembering the tears and convulsive sobs -
The pleasantries of school days will forever stay.
