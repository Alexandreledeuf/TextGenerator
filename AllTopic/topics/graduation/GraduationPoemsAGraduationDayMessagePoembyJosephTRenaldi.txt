With feelings of accomplishments this day,
To bring you peace of mind and happiness
In every special way.

Glow warmly in your beloved heart
Where the cherished classmates
Will forever play a vital part.
May Graduation Day be extra special
With elaborate pomp and show,
May the procession of elated graduates
Create glee and parent faces to glow.
May the ceremony for conferring diplomas,
The cards and acknowledgements and flowers
Fill the day with pride and immense joy
And delightful and meaningful hours.
May those you love and respect surround you
To share your moments of glory this day,
May the accolades of Graduation Day
Come into your life to forever stay.
