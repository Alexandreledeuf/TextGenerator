It's graduation!
A day supposed to be the happiest
The happiest at least in half a decade
And here on a molded parapet alone
Sat with visions blurred
And blinks with the speed of the clocks
It's graduation!
A day not as envisaged
With friends, love and family
In high praise and in great pride
In bliss and much merry
With fatted calves and drinks fizzy
It's graduation!
An end to a period of timelessness
In times of hunger and dreams unknown
In times of thirst and early wakes
Missions to accomplish in depths of stress
It's graduation!
A day that begins it all
