Four years may seem a fleeting moment
Leading towards a Commencement
Of highs, onwards to a new degree
Of lows to friends, a parting sorrow.
Moments endearing spent in school
Homeworks, thesis becoming a tool
Knowledge and learning- food for the soul
As graduation becomes a goal.
Looking back the early Freshman year
Made each classmate and friend so dear
Period of adjustment oh so hard
Oh, how College caught many off guard.
Then came Sophomore and Junior years
Drove so many several fears
Requirements of PASSING piling up
Doubling one's time, fixing the gap.
Then came SENIOR year, the FINAL stop
Practicum here and there, moving on
Seeing the light as the tunnel shone
Clearances accomplished now all gone.
Now as individuals marched and watched
I just can't help but shed a tear
Of moments spent in ups and downs
Of mixed emotions in getting the CROWN.
Congratulations.
