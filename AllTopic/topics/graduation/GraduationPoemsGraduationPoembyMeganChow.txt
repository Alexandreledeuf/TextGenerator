Graduation...
It seems so long ago
That we were in kindergarten
Eight years ago.
Ending elementary school,
Going on to high school.
Many things have happened
I'll always remember them.
Our parents have stood by us all these years,
Encouraging us in love
And support.
I wish I could relive those moments...
But it is not to happen.
Use your time wisely...
You will treasure it.
