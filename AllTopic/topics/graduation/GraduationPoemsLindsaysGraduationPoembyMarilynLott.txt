We were so proud of Lindsay
On her graduation day
She turned a fresh new corner
So much she had to say
For she had passed a milestone
What special memories
So beautiful and so talented
With wonderful qualities
Whatever she chose to do
We knew she’d do it well
Her family looked happily on
Full of pride, we could tell
Of course there are always
Bumps rising in the trail
But with Lindsay’s determination
How could she possibly fail?
It’s so wonderful to watch
Young people at their peak
So willing and so ready
For it’s knowledge that they seek
So we look at Lindsay’s pictures
We knew that she’d go far
Whatever direction she took
She’d be our special star!
