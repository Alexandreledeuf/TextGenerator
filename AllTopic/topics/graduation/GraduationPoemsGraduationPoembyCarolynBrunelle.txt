Sudden changes in the weather
Has you trying to hold it together.
Is it outdoors or indoors?
No one knows anymore.
Will there be lightning and thunder?
Will graduation happen at all, you wonder.
But keep on practicing
Hold on to that dream
Take a deep breath;
Try not to scream.
It’s always going to be something
That is outside the norm,
Because LIFE is all about
How you deal with the storms.
