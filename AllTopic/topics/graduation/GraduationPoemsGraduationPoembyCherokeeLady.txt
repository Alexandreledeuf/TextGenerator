It’s finally here,
Graduation day is finally here.
Everybody’s so excited,
It’s the most important day of our young lives.
Some of us are scared,
We are being sent out into the world.
College isn’t like high school,
You’re friends won’t be there with you.
We don’t know what to expect,
Or if we will like college.
We will have to make new friends,
And deal with new bullies.
We may not even be sure what we want to do,
But we will try to make the best of it.
Some of us will stay with family while we are at college,
But others will go away.
Even though we won’t be where we are used to,
We can still have fun.
Graduating made us individuals,
No longer a group.
Now we hope the world can handle us,
Because here we come.
Ready to make our own spot in the world,
And not just in our families.
