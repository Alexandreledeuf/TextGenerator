Graduation day
Is a long awaited day
For both parents and the graduate
Graduation day
Is a day of dream come true
The dream of parents since the child has born.
The joy and the pride
The parents feelings would be wordless.
All their effort to provide their children
With the best has been successfully
Fulfilled and paid off.
It is a climax day of a graduate
All the faces will be bright with smiles
Hands will be holding tissues
To wipe away
Tears of joy will be flowing
The graduate will be showered
With bouquets of flowers
Well wishes and best wishes
A day to be remembered now and then.
