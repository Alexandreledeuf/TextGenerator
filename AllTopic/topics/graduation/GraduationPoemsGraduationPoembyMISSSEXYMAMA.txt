I couldn’t wait to leave this place
The moment has arrived and I have tears streaming down my face.
Graduation is another one of my milestones.
Now I know I must face the world on my own.
I’ve waited for this moment for so long
Now I must go to college like I planned all along.
I’ll miss my friends that I’ve made.
My memories of high school will not fade.
