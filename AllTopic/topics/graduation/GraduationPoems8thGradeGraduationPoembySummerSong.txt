A puzzle together
a puzzle apart
each piece belongs to my heart
each piece is differant
each piece is great
But now they have to take on the long expected fate
They knew it would come
the day was here
the day they dreaded at the beginning of the year
The day they would be pulled apart
the whole would be broken
they knew it from the start
A piece here
and a piece there
how could life be so unfair
The beautiful picture the puzzle protrayed
is now forgotten
the pieces have strayed
They went away
fell beneath the wooden table
the puzzle would never again be stable
But that puzzle is forever in my heart
the memories of each piece
will never fall apart
