A puzzle together
a puzzle apart
each piece belongs to my heart
each piece is different
each piece is great
But now they have to take on the long expected fate
They knew it would come
the day was here
the day they dreaded at the beginning of the year
The day they would be pulled apart
the whole would be broken
they knew it from the start
A piece here
and a piece there
how could life be so unfair
When we use to laugh and do dares
We always use to think are teachers were unfair
But know we are older and have to grow up
We no longer have people taking us by the hand
And walking on such gentle land
