Graduation
Is it a a happy event
Or a sad one
Coz after what I've experienced today
It must be painful
Seeing my friends wave goodbye
Promising ourselves
Not to be separated by life
I hope this promise will never be broken
No matter where our dreams take us
No matter how many times life tries to separate us
We will always be great friends
Never strangers I hope
After the great times we've spent together
It was before that farewell moment
I felt so sad when I saw an empty class
I never thought this moment will ever come
I wanted a full one
Now when I think of graduation
The first thing that comes in my mind is
Who's gonna accept my selliness?
Who's gonna calm me down when I'm drowned in my hot tears?
Who's gonna tell me that everything's okay even though it's not
Dear  fellows,
Graduating is not all about school
But it is graduating from the life of teen age
Graduating from late childhood moments
To something more challenging
Something more fierce
But with the pictures we had in mind
Of those times
Of sharing a laugh
Will make it so much easier
The fact that we've been through a lot  and
These three years
Have made us stronger
It made us fighters
It shaped us into a HARD ROCK
so be proud of what we have done
Don't cry over spilt milk
After all, this life is a short journey
But we are doing our best to make it taste better
so now i can say
that graduation is a moment of a lifetime
in which we were transformed into ourselves.
