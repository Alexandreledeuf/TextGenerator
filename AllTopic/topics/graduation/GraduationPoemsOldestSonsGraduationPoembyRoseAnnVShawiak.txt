Sitting high upon the bleachers to get a good view of the made-up
stage.
A castle drawbridge with banners flying above it, the backdrop
for the walkway soon to be walked upon by many outstanding students.
Announcements, Star Spangled Banner, Pledge of Allegiance, and noted
teachers making their speeches.
At last, students standing row by row, single file, waiting for
their names of distinction to be called.
An eternity goes by, then suddenly my son is standing, walking,
waiting to be called onto the imaginary red carpet, as he strides
proudly across the walkway suspended slightly in the air.
Then it happens, they call his name, mispronounce it, but my son
walks without any hesitation or break in stride, to receive his
diploma, his moment in the spotlight.
Tears in my eyes, I quietly clap with dignity for my son, I
couldn't be prouder, my love for him overflowing.
Such a joyous moment in the life of a Mother, there are no words
to express how proud I am of him.
This moment in time reminding me of past moments in his life when
I was proud to be his Mother.
And now, once again, he has touched my life with his achievement
and I can only say, so humbly, how very proud I am, to be his
Mother.
