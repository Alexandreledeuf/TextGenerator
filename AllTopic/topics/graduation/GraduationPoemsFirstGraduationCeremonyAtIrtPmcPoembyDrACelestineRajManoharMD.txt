With cap and gown
And scroll in your hand,
You’ve joined an elite band:
A full-blown Doc!
The world needs you
To serve the sick;
A noble duty you must do
And keep aflame the wick.
The world is large
And so its challenges;
Ahead you charge;
Time will solve all problems.
And never forget
Your Alma Mater-
The place that made you
A Doctor.
And think awhile
About your teachers too;
They did a job fine that
All couldn’t do.
Remember friends,
You’re a noble lot;
Keep your Ethics,
And reach the top slot.
“Wish you a bright career! ”
