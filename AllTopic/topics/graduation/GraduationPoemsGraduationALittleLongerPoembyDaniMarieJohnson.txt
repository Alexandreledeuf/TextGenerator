Mmm I wanna linger
Mmm A little longer
Mmm A little longer here with you
Mmm It's such a perfect night
Mmm It doesn't seem quite right
Mmm That this is my last night with you.
Mmm Come September
Mmm We'll all remember
Mmm Our Central days and friendships true
Mmm And as the years go by
Mmm We'll all recall and sigh
Mmm This is goodnight and not goodbye
