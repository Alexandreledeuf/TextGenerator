does much to serve the good that we receive'
When embarking upon the pulpit
honor your perseverance;
your kindness for others;
as well as the respect and integrity
you have shown to the men and
woman that have invested in your future.
Hold your head high, you have reached
the goal that you have challenged
throughout life.
