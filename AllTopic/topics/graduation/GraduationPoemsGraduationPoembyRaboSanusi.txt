Have never faced challenge so gross
Once was a thing to rejoice
But after experiencing the hardship
Presented to me by the outside world...
Can't seem to figure where my faith lye
It all started after graduation
Everyone sending their warmth kudos
Then, I felt like the greatest achiever
But years past still roaming the streets
In search for a better tomorrow
My name now a household example
Of the numerous jobless graduates
Just another figure added
To the long list of unemployed youths
With my jeans getting worn out
So also is my creativity in the labour market
The only exotic memory i have left
Is the hope of meeting my glorious colleaguesâ€¦
On my way to the promise land
My acclaimed journey might be rough
But people are only interested in the brighter pix
Never knew this is what graduation is all about
Smiling faces as they all welcome you
After successful completion of studies...
Frowning faces after several months
Of scavenging for menial jobs
Quite had a lot of smile on my face before graduation
But now, the sole of my shoe explains it all
Discovered my talent on the rough edge of life
With this weapon called genius
I will triumph over failure
Wish to turn their gossip about my wretchedness
To that of the most accomplished graduate
Those who understand my cry
Should match along with me into stardom...
