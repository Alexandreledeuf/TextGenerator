Putting on a gown,
Heading into town.
Taking place in line,
Parents sitting way behind.
Talking with some friends,
I probably won't see again.
Walking to my seat,
Staring at my feet.
Embarrassed by all the eyes,
Wondering where are the guys.
Twisting my neck,
Everyone out there is a speck.
Sitting down anxious to begin,
Patience running kind of thin.
Speeches lasting way too long,
Where's the old marching song?
Finally up and out of the chair.
Trying not to mess up my hair.
Staring at the back of a head,
Hearing the names called instead.
Finally mine has been said.
Wishing I never left my bed.
Walking to grab a rolled up paper,
Smiling in the direction of the sole clapper,
Hearing the shouts and laughter,
Shaking hands and posing after.
Walking back to the same chair?
Waiting to throw my cap in the air.
Up it goes in a drum of applause
We are definitely a lost cause.
Picking up my cap from the floor.
Heading out and saying bye,
I don't even remember that guy.
Finding my family and some friends
Posing for pics in front of the lens.
Closing my laptop and taking off my gown,
Maybe someday I'll head into town.
When life is far from a guarantee, Imagination must meet virtual reality.
