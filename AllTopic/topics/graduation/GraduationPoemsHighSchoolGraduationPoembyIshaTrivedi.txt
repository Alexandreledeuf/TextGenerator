Today you are graduating and getting ready for college,
To learn new things, to receive more knowledge.
Since you were born your parents have dreamt of this day,
They just wish they didn't have to send you away.
And though we're not here to celebrate this event,
We'll remember it forever, this everlasting moment.
This is the peak of success in your eighteeen years,
With more to come, we give you our cheers.
Down come the tears, good luck to you,
We'll see you again with a college degree too!
