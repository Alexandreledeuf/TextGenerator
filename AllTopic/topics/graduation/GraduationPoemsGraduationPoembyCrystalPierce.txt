Two years and I'll be gone.
Being a sophomore is rather boring.
I spend 5 of my seven classes snoring.
It's kinda weird to think that in two years,
just two school years, I'll be facing my fears.
I'm gonna graduate with a mediocre college degree.
This is how my school years will end for me.
I'm smart enough to pass
but to slow to grasp.
I can play quite a few instruments, that could help.
And at least I haven't failed.
It's gonna be different living on my own.
