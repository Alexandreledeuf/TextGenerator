Graduations are for those selected few.
Relax your future is in view.
At last you've reached the finish line.
Done all you need. So stand and shine.
U are among the very best.
At school you've passed the final test.
To stand proud amongst your peers.
In time you've learned to face your fears.
On with your life. Your diploma in hand.
No better view from where you stand.
