The award of diploma
Is every student's desire;
It's like a sweet aroma
Aimed by heart's burning fire.
An acceptance of medal
Is an icing on the cake;
The day is very special,
A chance one must really take.
During many years in course,
Research and quizzes seem hard;
Results are better, not worse,
Bringing cool and sweet reward.
The speech in the occasion
Is awesomely inspiring;
Giving righteous direction,
Like what words of wisdom bring.
The teachers utter farewell,
So do the classmates and friends;
Goodbye and good luck they tell,
As the last day in school ends.
