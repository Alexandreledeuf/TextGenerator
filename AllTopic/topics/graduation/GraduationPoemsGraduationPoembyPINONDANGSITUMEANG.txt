Six years have past
You finally done last
This is the beginning not the last
Keep walking fast
Till next graduation of class
My heart was filled with sweet Alleluya
Of thousand of red roses aroma
When you saw me your diploma
You didn't turn down the sacrifices of your mama
We proud of you Antonia
Stay strong never surrender
All thing happend with God power
Never stop say a prayer
Faith unto Him forever
