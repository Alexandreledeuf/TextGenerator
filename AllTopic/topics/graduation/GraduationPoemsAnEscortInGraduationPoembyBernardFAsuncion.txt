J-ust let the twilight pass;
H-aze and mist fade away;
U-nderneath the blue sky,
N-ew dawn meets the day.
M-orn nineteenth February
I-s setting Sunday aright;
L-et the sunlight rise,
A-fter the long cold night.
N-ow that your daughter has finished primary education;
O-pen your arms to be an escort in graduation.
