Finished contemplating
cap list tassle proud
searching
are you kidding me
no employment found
humor me is this real
not what I expected
education will get you ahead
unemployment lines instead
no resources only  family
and government I'm sick
luxury, the first thing I can do without
that means catfood with no cat
while titans of industry
continue to get  fat
Lucky am  I
no house no foreclosure
only a second hand trailor
on the edge of town.
I am very sad.
