You will march today to mark the end
of your midnight candles before books,
notes, bulk of papers and reminders;
marking, too, the end of restless nights
while facing practical tests and final exams.
Today you will march together
to be watched by great crowd of parents,
relatives and friends; today you will
receive your diploma of your hope and labor.
And today I watch you with great pride
and delight as your mother, looking at you
as a new registered nurse, who passed
your studies with incredible flying colors.
Congratulations, dear child!
