As you drive away
I wave goodbye,
And remember the times
We laughed and cried.
As you drive away
I slowly start to cry
And remember how much
You hurt me deep inside.
As you drive away
I’m filled with anger
Because you never said
You’re sorry for my pain.
As you drive away
I look my life
…And yours,
And I forgive you.
As you drive away
I wave goodbye
Then, stand and watch
And realize it graduation day
And nothing will ever be the same.
