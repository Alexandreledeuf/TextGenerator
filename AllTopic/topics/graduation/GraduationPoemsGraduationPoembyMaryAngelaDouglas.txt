we'll heap gardenias on the stage
and sing together only the true songs
from the heart like a petal folded down
to mark this space, this transition
others made before us too.
and in the chapel of ourselves recall
the universe we studied the pale green halls and feel
one course finished, another yet to start and so we pause
like trembling stars in the early evening
and wait to play our part
seal off the exits that fear may not enter in this day
nor war nor sickness tragedy that bears so many away
too young. God make us sure in the way that we must go but now
hold us still in the rose bower of this hour
and let the spell be cast through mingled prayers and tears
that makes the fragrant moment last and last
beyond the felling of the years.
