Walks down the halls one last time,
knowing it is the last time,
Empty rooms where we sat the last four years,
empty lockers where books were kept,
Walks down and across the stage into a new life,
no more bells-early mornings- or being late,
A new life awaits, won't wait forever,
live life the way it was designed,
