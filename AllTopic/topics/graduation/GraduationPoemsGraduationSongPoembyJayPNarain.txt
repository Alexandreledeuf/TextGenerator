It's the hour of the graduation,
hope soars beyond imagination,
The hard work and sleepless nights,
are only the memories of the bygone days.
Feel free, as we always wanted,
Aim for the rosy future, as we always dreamt of,
Be, as we were meant to be.
The time has come for the,
exciting new life to begin,
The fear and anxiety of an unknown future,
don't even creep in mind.
The sweet touch of hugs and kisses,
from family and friends,
would be everlasting in the indebted heart.
the joy and happiness on their faces,
would be engraved forever in thoughts.
Feel free, as we always wanted,
Aim for the rosy future, as we always dreamt of,
Be, as we were meant to be.
