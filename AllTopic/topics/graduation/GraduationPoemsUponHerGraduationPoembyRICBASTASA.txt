Upon her graduation from law school
i see that picture
her husband beside her and the
(adopted)  child wrapped in her arms
time mends everything
like a grafted branch of a tree
the leaves grew from buds
and soon
the flowers bloom giving its
sweet scent to the air
for everyone to smell
the force of life knows always
where to go what to do what to fill up
and when
no one notices anyhow
the smiles cover what once was very lacking....
