As we look back,
At what we have done,
And at what we have completed thoroughly.
We finally see what we have accomplished,
And failed at to some degree.
As we look back,
And see our friends,
And how we have become a family.
We realize what we will miss,
Of the friendships that came to be.
As we look back,
and see our parents,
who never gave up or stopped believing,
they were here when we triumphed,
and here when we fell to our knees.
As we look back,
with all our friends,
And see all of the memories of our lives,
This is for everyone who is almost there,
Itâ€™s for the class of 2005.
