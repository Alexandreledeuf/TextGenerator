perhaps it is true
too much love can kill
in love poems too
got much
and now reading another love poem
gives me goose bumps
sometimes i think
making the love poem
and another love poem simply shows
your having not loved much
and your being not loved in return
love more and even if unrequited love some more
get up from a loving fall
cure that bruise
mend that broken heart
love still even when the world has learned the art of
indifference and hate more than any other
takes time to learn to do this
to know that love is giving and giving and giving
and then
after years of this kind of loving and giving
you will experience what i had gone through
now the love poem doesn't tickle anymore
nature does
the waves of the sea caressed by the hands of twilight
the moon nesting on the marsh
the grasses all wet with dew
the clouds pregnant with the blows of the wind
the gentle rain falling on the roof tops
the geese on their v-flight
the fledgling jumping from the nest to learn to fly
you see, this is what i am engrossed in now.
a beautiful world that i have not described well enough.
