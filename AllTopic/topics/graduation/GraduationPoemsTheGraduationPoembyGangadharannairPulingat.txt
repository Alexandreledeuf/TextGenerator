Graduation, an aspiration
An empowerment and a pathfinder
Where a bright future one can expect
With lot of hopes, and much efforts
The great universities, colleges
The studies, assignments, and all
Graduation, the parent's concern
On their little ones future
Their own life ambitions, all included
The books, periodicals, charts
The computer skills, the libraries
The mind wandering with all materials
Beautiful concern for knowledge.
