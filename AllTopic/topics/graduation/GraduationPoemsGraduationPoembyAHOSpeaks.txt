After many years of life and varied experience for me
I wish to leave a few words for you to record in your memory
Your about to embark on a journey that is paved with responsibility.
It matters not whether you are to continue your education or not
Be concious the next few years may not be exactly what you sought
Experience can be varied or routine but always given; believe it or  not
Responsibility and intent will be entwined for most of your actions
Be aware also that what you do, say and think, may be a quick reaction
What we do many time is not what was meant and needs a retraction.
The world can be your oyster and you can have your fill
.Life can be good or bad but rarely a bitter pill
The family is paramount and to destroy or seperate, is not God's will.
Every mind is precious and could hold the key
To open the door and  hopefully change history.
Time is not illusionary or taken out of turn
Who created our sun and set the parameters, so earth would not burn?
God gives us life, time, and most importantly light
The gift of a mind to recognize wrong acts from right.
The cause is not valid if the deeds are wrong
Nor is any act that removes life certainly does not belong.
