The moment it is realized,
A chip long carried on your shoulder
Has been dissolved...
A graduation has occurred.
And you have moved on.
It has dawned on you,
Bitterness that you knew...
Has gone!
It's graduation day!
And knowing you belong among
Those who can truthfully say they can forgive.
Is a blessing to have lived to learn,
That lesson!
So many have failed and given up.
They are the ones heard stuck...
Finding fault with everything.
And nothing within them is felt to give!
Those are the ones who live life,
Being right without insight!
And on the tips of their tongues,
Is a complaint about something or someone.
And what who did and how it was done...
To them.
They want the attention,
Although they don't listen!
And...
At some point in time,
Minds they have are left behind!
In affairs misunderstood with blame to claim.
