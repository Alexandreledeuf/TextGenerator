As the years in our lives pass by,
We come closer to our lives so gatsby,
Yes, I am talking about graduation day,
A day filled with mixed feelings of our life's way,
A day so inspiring for some,
Yet so disheartening that it may make one feel completely gone,
But there is light at the end of the tunnel,
As we may notice some dreams of us bubble,
So let us not lose hope,
And instead work hard every other day,
To reach closer to our lives beautiful way,
And this will make our lives so bright and gay.
