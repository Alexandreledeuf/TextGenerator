The more I look back on all the happy times
The easier it is for me to realize
That friends are much more then hellos and goodbyes
It all comes down to what you have inside.
Yes, some are good singers and some are athletic
But that doesn't matter (are you starting to get it?)
All that is important is the feeling inside
If your white or black or green or blue eyed.
For me to sit and say 'I wont miss this old place'
Is wrong and untrue (cant you tell it in my face?)
All the friends and teachers meant so much to me
I dont know any place that I'd rather be.
'Those were the days, ' I'd hear my parents say.
Charish their years...each and everyday
The people you'll meet and the places you'll go
And the hurt once thats gone is more then you'll know.
All my friends will be leaving and I''ll still be here
All my friends i'll be losing is my greatest fear
Promise you wont forget me as you go away,
Promise you'll be back to see me someday!
