Before, you were a child.
Trying to know everything
in the world.
Experiencing new things
and working out problems.
Making new friends everyday.
Always so energetic and
full of speed.
Loved to watch cartoons
on the weekends.
Would go places with your
parents.
Now...
Your all grown up.
Moving through life as if
being lifted into the sky.
Making your own decisions.
Learning good and bad,
and hanging out with friends
more often.
A lot more homework and
a lot more responsibilities.
Wanting your own way.
Falling in love, and getting
a job.
Then before you know it,
your already graduating.
The happy memories from
before stay with you.
The pictures of the past are
kept in your heart.
The soft graduation music
starts playing.
Then... it's time.
As you walk down the aisle,
beautifully dressed, you think,
my life as a young adult has
begun.
I wonder what lies ahead of
me as I go down the path.
Then, before you know it,
it's over.
Your nervousness has passed
and your finally moving on.
Soon to go anywhere you want to.
Soon to be independant.
Your whole world spins as you
try to think of the past.
The future confuses you,
but it's ok.
Your just flying through life.
