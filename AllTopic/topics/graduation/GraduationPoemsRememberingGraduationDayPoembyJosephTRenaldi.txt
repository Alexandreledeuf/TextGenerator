We often live reminiscing the past
as another graduation day comes around.
Thoughts of our classmates and teachers
in our memory will always be found.
We remember the school days of yesteryear
and revel them with gentle care,
that once we knew when we were just
youngsters growing up without a dare.
Through the fleeting days of our education,
We built our agenda of many dreams
from elementary school to secondary school.
It was merely only a step it now seems.
We miss all the activities that once was ours
and the blessing that we were always free.
We live them over ever graduation day
with pleasant thoughts and glee.
Far too quickly the passing of time,
even though satisfying be the ways
that lure us back to yesteryear
to the events of other school days.
Though another graduation day shall end,
One goal for all graduates to hold,
May your education always bring good fortune
and happiness and success a hundred fold.
