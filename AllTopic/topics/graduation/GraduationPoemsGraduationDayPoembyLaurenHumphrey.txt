Memories float among the abyss,
As hearts smile with joy,
And cry with loneliness.
Although happiness prevails,
The sorrow lingers on.
People glow a new shade,
And life begins to take on new meaning.
The long speeches and the loud applauseâ€™s fill the void.
The joyful cheers and the bone crushing hugs subside the pain
Today is graduation day.
It is not an ending but a new beginning.
