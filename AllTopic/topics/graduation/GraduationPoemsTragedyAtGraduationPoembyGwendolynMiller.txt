A girl who is seventeen,
A girl who is Rory Gilmore,
A girl that walks with confidence,
A girl who always leaves the door open to endless possibility.
As enemies in high school,
Hatred ran through the veins of Jordyn Parker for me,
Jordyn and I both wanted to be lawyers,
I was accepted into Yale University, while Jordyn was not.
Chilton High School was the beginning of a tragic ending,
Only two valedictorians in the school,
I was one, Jordyn was the other,
The other chose to make herself absent.
A palace like structure was the place of Jordyn's disappearance,
All the lights were off in the building except for the auditorium,
The last time Jordyn was seen was at around 5: 00 p.m.,
The schedule was to begin at 7: 00 p.m.
Shock engulfed me leaving me helpless,
My heart began to beat faster and faster,
A silhouette could be seen in a room,
As I began to walk towards the room it too moved.
Graduation consumed my mind,
Graduation had consumed my mind for the past twelve years,
Where was she,
How could she not afford to not represent herself?
Jordyn passed away at 6: 55 p.m.,
All she needed was some direction,
Jealousy was the outline behind the sheet of actions,
In a letter she stated, 'the world is looking out for you.'
Tragedy at Graduation.
