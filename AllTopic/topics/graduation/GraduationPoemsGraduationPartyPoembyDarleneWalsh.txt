A gentleman or so he seemed
A graduation present was his need
From me my cherry was his goal
Given his way he would have stole
That which is precious for me to save
Until my special wedding day
He kissed and asked, and I said no
He reached, he touched, and I said no
He pushed and grabbed, and I said no
He tried to force and I said no
He didn't stop and I said no
Then with my knee I did said NO
Now he is hurt and I should go
So all his cloths I gathered fast
Through the window they did pass
And past his friends must go his ass
