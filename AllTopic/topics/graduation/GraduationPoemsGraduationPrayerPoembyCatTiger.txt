You’ve completed a task
Set four long, hard years ago
To prove that you can last
In life’s commercial show.
But more than just that
You’ve experienced new places
In books and from chat
With exciting new faces.
And now you’re ready
To journey lonely paths
To give value, remain steady,
Facing recompense or wrath.
May God watch over you
And keep you in His toll
Strengthening the best in you
As you achieve your goal.
