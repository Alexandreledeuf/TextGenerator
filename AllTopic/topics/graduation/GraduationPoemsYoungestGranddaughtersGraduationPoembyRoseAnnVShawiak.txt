This morning going to my Granddaughter's kindergarten graduation,
her little eyes and face lit up like a lantern, smiling beautifully,
running to give us a hug.
Going into the auditorium, sitting down, watching crowds of parents
and Grandparents storming in with younger kids and babies in tow, a
much bigger crowd than the school had expected.
Adding chairs and benches on either side of the bleachers to accomo-
date us all, kindergarteners sitting on the floor in front of us,
looking around, talking and waving.
Six kindergarten classes, a lot of children, picking my Granddaughter
out of them all, wearing a beautiful blue dress and white shoes with
a little heel.
Her brown hair flowing, a smile on her face, singing with her class
and performing all rhythmic motions, a totally wonderful experience
watching her graduate with honors and awards.
A blessed event in our family that will always be remembered in
pictures and this little poem written by her poetical Grandma, a
future treasure when I'm no longer here.
