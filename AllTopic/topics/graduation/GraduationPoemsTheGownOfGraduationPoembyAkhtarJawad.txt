No need to be confined in a net of knitted straws
no need to be afraid of lightning and thunders of the clouds
no need to hide behind the feathers of a mother bird
now you don't need the shoulders of a father bird.
The gown you wore is enough to protect you in the flights to come.
My daughter bird I know it's raining heavily
lightning and thunders of the clouds are frightening
but the gown is an umbrella against all evils of the clouds
ignoring the evils of the clouds be safe and secured
in the beautiful rains the clouds provide,
the pleasant winds will bounce back a little mild showers you need.
Beauty of rains is infinite and its threats are finite.
Now fly below the skies and pluck the twinkling diamonds.
We are here in the nest, the same old knitted net of straws.
Let us pay thanks to the kind and benevolent ancient light
filtered through the greenery of a tree
reflected and refracted that are still showing mini rainbows.
Forming a beam of shining dust particles of aging,
with a positive approach we can see even dust as a beauty.
Let us capture memories of incubating a beautiful egg
let us forget the fatigues of incubation,
and let us pay thanks to God who bestowed upon us
and gave us a right egg for incubation!
