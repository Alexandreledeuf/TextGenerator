ON YOUR GRADUATION DAY
(To my child, Melly Rose)
Melvin Banggollay
The hurdle my child is not yet over
I said when we went to the stage together
On this special day you finished another
ladder of life as graduates like the others.
But as soon as we were on the stage
I felt how my loving father rejoiced
On this day I heared many adage
of distinguished student's   turmoils.
When I heared one of the graduates
Narrating the unselfish sacrifices
Of his father who died before he graduates
Teardrops fell like unbroken necklaces
As I behold how my own father radiates
a love so full with care full of traces.
When you gave me your diploma
As token of your great  sacrifices
My eyes was filled with sweet aroma
of  thousand flowers tenderness
as my eyes build a million aurora
For you didn't turned down my sacrifices
but nurtured them for your own success.
Congratulation dear beautiful child of mine
for doing what is best that can help you define
The future that lies ahead untill you can fine
destiny of your fate that your faith entwine.
Stand strong and never  surrender
As trials come in your way while you harbor
to define your own life amidst great strife
But have faith  and you can have a better life
and all things can happen with God's power
If faith unto Him your load and charger.
