White highlighted by purple and gold
upon our arrival, we nervously walked through the threshold
her arm safely secured
the couple that would never be
every glance down the aisle
greeted with a smile
it meant so much to me
procession drags on
with haint of praise
narrated by nastalgic songs
parchment recieved with pride
a bitter signature on a note
tha bares goodbyes
with a flash
my progress is cemented in time
The fire is in us tonight
Applause shows thier respect
whats next for us?
my graduating class
relief settles in, with words of love
to much crying
never enough hugs
I saw her
I heard her words
and met them with an embrace
choked up
the words bled sincerity and truth
my chin on her shoulder
arms wrapped around tight
'I love you'
hands down
that long awaited beauty
made my night
hesitation was key
I replied
never mocking
I hope she believed me
the after math
was filled with ash
my freinds ahd fire in thier lungs
the dramitic lives
and the pride of the young
the fire blazed
high and well
speech flowed
'we gave em hell'
separation was not a notion
all we have
is what we left
milestones and broken homes
senceless acts of innocents
trials by fire
drama and laugh
hold to it
live, learn from it
we cant get it back
