Thoughts of you, how my temperature rises
Your body next to mine so divine
Your touch electric upon my skin
Lost in the lust of our connection.
When we meet my body is alive
My control is abandoned to you
Nothing can equal the feelings I have
Iâ€™m lost in my lust for you.
Into a world of pure desire
We are locked together
United we feel the flow
Touch, taste, explore.
Lost to Lust
