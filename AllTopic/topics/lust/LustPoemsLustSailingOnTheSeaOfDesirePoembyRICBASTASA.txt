sail with me
on my boat to the sea
your breasts my paddles
my pelvis your floor
sail with me
in the ocean of desire
lust with me
on this little leak of my
boat to the sea
sink with me
to the deepest thoughts
of the sea
learn with me
the meaning of love
the true meaning of true love
death of desire
rising at the end
to the greater joys of foam
at the surface
the sun, the moon and then the stars
