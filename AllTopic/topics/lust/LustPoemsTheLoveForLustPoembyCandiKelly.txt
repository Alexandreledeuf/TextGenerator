Wake me up from this dream,
Nothings ever as it seems.
This secret gift we do not share, leaves me wondering if you'll always be there.
You bring me up when I am down.
You make me smile when you see a frown.
Being with you is our own perfect world.
A great escape from our reality that leaves us bored.
I am yours as you are mine.
A special love thats so devine.
Through the years there will be tears.
Lots of laughter and conquering of fears.
I give you my body my mind and my soul,
your love completes me, it makes me whole.
You are so perfect in every single way.
I can't live without you not even a day.
