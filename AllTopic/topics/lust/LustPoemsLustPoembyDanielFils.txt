lust is a passionate desire. When I lust I cant to be tamed you think SEX but I think LIFE.......nobody can stop you from lust more you lust life more you become he who is untamed not worrying about the opinion of others but only of your own. For you are your own worst enemy, and I am that enemy that will stop at no end to defeat my offenders.
