Are stolen fruits the most exciting?
Down on you with tongue delighting
As a butterfly lands on a flower
Then rough and wild hour on hour
A voracious animal, a wild beast
Spreads you out for his feast
Uninhibited bursts of passion
So gentle a tongue, then a lashing
Mouthfuls then fingers in so deep
Sucking and licking – forget sleep!
Stop don’t stop O stop please please!
Rivers run - I’m on my knees!
You grin demented wild and free
Laughing madly in pleasure’s glee
Untamed the passion erupts to bliss
Then a wet dirty hungry kiss!
Vesuvius erupts and earthquakes roar
Howling moaning, come back for more!
In a frenzied torrent of lust and passion
Waves of a storm, downward crashing!
Slow deep and in - the thrusting goes
Till faster faster the whole thing blows!
A runaway train smashing into a station
Eruptions fly in exultation!
Full body slamming from the top
Yields a fair good splashing crop
Full body slamming from behind
You love it babe – hard and kind!
From after midnight thru till noon
Like dogs in heat before the moon!
Entangled and caught within your snare
Your touch and love are all my care.
