Feeling restless, feeling high
This aching heat, it will never die
It consumes me so, from the inside
Wanting escape, release, be on fire.
I need to hear you breathlessly curse
And moan and sigh my name
To taste the salty sheen on your skin,
And feel every nuance of your passionate embrace
Tell me with your body how much you need me,
Tell me with each thrust how desperate you are
I want to hear your crazy erratic heartbeat
To slowly melt in your heat as you feel me
To taste our sinful essence on your tongue
Entangled in my mouth like you can't get enough.
Throw me on the bed of lust, consume me,
I want you to make me lose myself completely.
