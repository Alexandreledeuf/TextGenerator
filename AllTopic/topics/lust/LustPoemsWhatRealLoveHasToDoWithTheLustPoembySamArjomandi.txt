These days everybody uses word love to express his or her feeling
But the problem is majority of them don’t know the real love meaning
What real love has to do with the lust?
If you get confused between love and lust, you are going to pay the price, whatever the cost
Remember, one of the most important part of your life is your feeling
So, when it comes to the real love, you better watch out with whom you are dealing
Real love requires sacrifices, respect, caring, forgiveness and trust
If you attracted to someone solely for your looks, that’s not the love, that’s a pure lust
This poem has a message especially for young people and teenage
Because lust, not the real love is the most popular one at this age
You can easily involve in a bad relationship
If every time someone claims, that loves you and you give away your heart so easy and so cheap
unfortunately, the teenage girls are the most victims of the lust
So, you better get your college degree first, then you mature enough to know, when it comes to real love, who you should trust
