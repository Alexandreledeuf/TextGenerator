In my mind i capture and seduce you with the inevitable blashphemy dreams of sex
Lust at our sight dominating our control of the prudent mind,
it's so clear of what this can lead to next
your eyes gazing at me
lost at the sight of my plush red lips
overcomining ethic mentality
And you kiss me, a kiss of greed,
of wanting to endure the feeling of wanting more,
grasping the lust out of me
oh, you kiss me
your kisses like streams flowing to my neck
then to the anatomy of my breast
oh, your kisses like winter snow in mid december
descending with the rythum of my heart
and am unable to breathe my pulse unable to rest
you want me but not completly
just the love of my physical body
the nudity, the fire that burns between my legs
the lurid world hidden in my runic thoughts
so your monster can run wild with lust
then you'll leave, pretending this ever happened
this sight, this sacred dream
now of lucid exsistance with a secret scilence of a meer memory
of my breathing left unbroken.
