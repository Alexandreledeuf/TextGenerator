The last with lust...
between your arms...
here i am...
as a great panel...
drew by a great artist...
in front of your eyes...
here i am...
as boat without drone...
has no leader to ride...
lay away your imaginations...
threw your paintbrush away...
here i am your panel which you seeks for...
waiting your touches...
waiting your colors...
needing you as paintbrush...
to draw me through your fires..
and to fire each others..
let me lie down peacefully into your lap...
pillow my head on your chest...
to throw all worries back...
with a happiness taking a nap while you hugging me...
get me more close to you...
let me lose myself through your hot breathes...
and your exciting whispers...
to give me all colors of love...
here i am your panel...
give me your hot colors...
give me, my happiness through your great appetite...
draw me with your lips...
with your hot naked body fire me...
with no stop..
with no mercy...
to the last with lust...
