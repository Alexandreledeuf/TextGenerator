My heart beats faster as I almost expect you to be there,
As I look for you for, for  your eyes, for your lips, for your touch.
My skin yearns for you, for your fingers to linger across my chest.
My lips need your soft tender kiss. I can't keep doing this I can't stop doing this, I need this, I need you. I.. need.. you. This thing, this yearning, this lust, I need.
