Tequila breath, death, sex, your face.
Little dirty secrets and your young taste.
Never too scared to try what the public hates.
Showing me your naked body with no haste.
I can see the eagerness in your eye's.
I can feel the trembling in your thighs.
You'll just tell your parents lies.
No one knows the sinful lust you tried.
You stick your tongue deep inside my mouth.
Exhilerated, youve become what makes you proud.
A little piece of death inside my eye's.
Lets lock the door and make angels cry.
Sinful lust in the nude you trust.
Inner beauty, our privates our most fun.
Dont be scared, youve done it before.
So its okay, were both filthy whores.
But on the outside we seem so clean.
Sometimes things arent as they seem.
Dirty secrets for eternity.
Well wear our masks for the world to see.
