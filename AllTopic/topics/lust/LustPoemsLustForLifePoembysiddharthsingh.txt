Discontented heart and a restless soul,
unaware i was of my goals.
Alcohol, cocaine, hashish and grass
transformed me to a creature crass.
They pervaded the blood in my veins
squandered me to world obscure,
where enlightenment was feign.
There, euphoria didn't differ from pain.
A drizzle felt like deluge, a whisper like roar.
Where the breeze was a storm,
It was a world with no rules no norms.
When the monsters exited my veins,
my blood burned with fire,
bringing me down the spiral
melting me into an uninsurable mess.
The hallucinatory clouds quickly dissipated
bringing to me, numbness i hardly anticipated.
Such felt the lights glare, i hid from its flair,
surrendered myself to darkness and gloom.
Grappling with questions,
i gave in to the temptation.
They took me to a world so high
far from grievances and sighs.
Little did i know,
my ship struggling to dropp anchor
drifted me away from the shore of my life.
Being a recluse was no longer an excuse.
Empathy, loath, rebuke, resentment
in keeping me company, were all redundant.
From my eyes fell tears of blood,
for i was drowning in a flood.
Helpless one day, i found myself on bed.
My mother's palm gently stroking my forehead.
I was surrounded by moist eyes
all of them wearing an honest disguise,
making me feel i would still find my light,
that my future was shining bright.
Such intense was my lust for life, then.
Death was waiting to stake it's claim on my life, when.
