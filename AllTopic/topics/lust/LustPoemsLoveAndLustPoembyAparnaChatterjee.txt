Bodies entwined
Hearts resounding
the shivers of sweat
coming and going
Those inhibited places
opening up: slowly, gently,
delicately
losing inhibitions
new sensations
A touch here
and a touch there
smokeless fire!
A miracle invisible
to 'him and her'
Yet to You and Me
engulfed in passion
lustful love or lovable lust?
Let love be there
and lust be too
A heavenly feeling
for me and you
feel yourself and feel me too
Fantasies unfold
dreams come true
Me for You and Only You
just the way you wanted to!
