Entranced by the jewels of youth
when mischief rules our minds,
and hormones raging, so uncouth,
our eyes upon behinds,
I fell for you, in tender storms
that swelled, beyond the fly,
a promise of what might  be,  resting on the thigh,
And yet
As you raised your staff upward, towards the sky,
the dawning of my vision cleared,
and now I merely question...
What was I thinking?
