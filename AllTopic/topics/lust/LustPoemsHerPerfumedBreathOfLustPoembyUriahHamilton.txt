Love can be
A miracle surprise
Beaming from
A stranger’s eyes
Whom you meet
On a city street
While the stars
Are dancing around
Her angelic soul
Hypnotizing and
Mesmerizing you
Into psychic rapture;
You take her hand
And walk to the beach,
The beautiful music
Of seashells jangling
Provide the soundtrack
For seduction,
Her small earrings
Beckon your mouth
To kiss and nibble
The ears they adorn,
Her body is warm
As you excitedly inhale
Her perfumed breath of lust,
You’re pleasantly paralyzed
With ecstatic joy!
