i have seen the fullness of the glory of
the front
i am awed
my mouth gaped
my saliva flowed
the heart has no words to say
there is marvel in every
nerve
barbaric in some places
setting aside wisdom
embracing
the moment
loving each minute
lusting that may last
for hours
thirst that never satisfies itself with
water
the hunger that cannot be filled
with the wheatness of
bread
i ask you to make the the turn
so i can see the past
the fullness of your back
the smoothness of that hidden skin
the curves that have given me the sense
of danger
but all these, beauty and desire
must prevail
there is glory everywhere
there are songs in every corner
a poem found in every slit
there are treasures shown by the maps of
every wanting
always insatiable
always unbearable.
