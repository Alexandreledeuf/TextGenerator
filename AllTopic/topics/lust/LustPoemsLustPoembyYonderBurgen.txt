Today i realised
lust is not lust
i must not be fussed with lust
because i have a big bust
Lust isnt what it seems
a hierarchy of beems
what does it deem to be?
not what it seems
I had lust at my breast
through that meaty chest
i did my best
but lust took my breast
under the breast lies thy heart
lust has to wonder along that part
it broke my heart
i siezed the day
