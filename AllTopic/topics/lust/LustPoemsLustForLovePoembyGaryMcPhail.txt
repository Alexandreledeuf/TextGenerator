Trecking in from the wind,
Is a beauty so joyful,
She begins to sing,
Also very playful,
My babe is under my wing.
We fly away when the time is necessary,
Rain or shine
We glide so high,
Feeling safe which is a necessity,
No one can deny or intefere which is why,
we float in extacy,
Bleeding through our veins,
Running deep in our blood,
Is more we could gain,
With a added bonus for a lust for love.
