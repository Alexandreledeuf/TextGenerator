Do you ever see me bleed? how my eyes be come so numb
How my body felt so cold and froze can't seem to move a bit
Memorise every step that we take in the affection which was true
Which never seem to break through but all that days has gone
Do you ever heard me cry out for you? in my breathless murn
In my weak heart just broke that I can't take in but to bury all that moments deep inside of me
Why does love is such a crime?
When our love was just so real?
Why would someone want a part like this?
When we knew we were meant to be
How my heart peel into pieces like a broken glass that can't  be un-do
How our feelings and the affeaction is like a drung like what you said to me onces but that last.
How  you wishper Don't worry I knew I'm gone to lost you forever
I knew my heart belonge to you but i give up and let go of you
It ain't felt right to be with you when you had someone'else but me
Left me here with my sorrow lock me up for so long felt like years that you left me here, but for sure you gone but this time is for good
But I'm the one that walk out of for real I can't bury  it inside
Goodbye to you  my love, LOve  Is just like a lust
Giving up on you love Isn't easy
It ain't easy to forget you for sure that is real
It ain't easy to say it to you like this on the telephone
Felt the numb in my weak heart hopeyou hear me for the last
BUt yOU knew how much I LOve you
From my heart and soul which is true
It break my heart to say this way
But can't see it how hard it is for me to say this
