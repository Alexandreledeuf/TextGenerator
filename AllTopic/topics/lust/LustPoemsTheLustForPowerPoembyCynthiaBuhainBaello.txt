The lust for power consumes men
Blinds the mind and pollutes reason
Diverts good purposes and then
Corrupts the character's condition.
The lust for power is seductive
Erodes the noble and benign
Ignores all truth, it's so destructive
Insatiable hunger is there assigned.
A dragon of three heads set free
Devours all who would come near
Lust for power grows greedily
Claws in position, breeding fear.
It lacks all sense of  decency
And by callous ardor will try to hold
The power it gained deceitfully
Ignoring Justice and Truth foretold.
