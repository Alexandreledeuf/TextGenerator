Love is something devine
falls from the heaven to earth
It expects nothing for it  but
It renders everything to others including itself
Love never ends in lust but
it grows as affection and respect
Lust expects to exploit others
to satisfy it's needs
Matured love becomes grace
lust may not be so
Lust spoils the character and life
when it develops as aggressive
Love never feeds the violence but
Lust grows in violence and feeds violence
To my Younger generation!
have a love to smash the lust
Pave the way to peace  and
take this world to that end
