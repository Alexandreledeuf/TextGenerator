There is no love or lust
it is body hunger and must
there is nothing like love or attachment
it is pure mechanism for adjustment
Who can define it as pure lust?
can any one claim its purest form
when he or she is not readily informed?
it is purely need that is legally transformed
i wish to condemn all on that name
we can definitely over come it and rename
love or lust grows with time and age
we are simply bonded in  cage
it is fine name given by literary world
we simply blow hot and cold
let there be open soul search?
no one may come forward with his research
it is purest form of love if we can understand
it may mushroom in any form with wife or husband
how do you over come  some short comings?
that is fine phase with new innings
life is nothing new but a bad or good phase
we love to play it and still face
All possible criticism with no fun fare
No one is possible cautious or aware
let us not wrap it in beautiful cover
it existed before and may remain forever
no one has escaped and may not do so in future
this fact must be realized for sure
we are human beings and may react strongly
this is wrost represntation with face so ugly
it is pity we ignore the  universal  fact
it may remain forever as matter of fact
we may strongly disprove
we may try nice point to prove
the world may take note of it but remain unmoved
the misgivings must  at any cost be removed
