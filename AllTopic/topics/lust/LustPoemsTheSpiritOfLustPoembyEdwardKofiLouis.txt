I thought you were history when,
I heard the slam at the door!
But like the tale of two obsessions in love,
We are like the musical chairs on this love.
My son is for the sun and your mum is for the moon,
But i thought you were history when i heard the slam at the door!
And if only tears were laughter,
Then, i will be able to take you along to paradise.
I am dumped without a clue to use the glue,
But the Spirit of Satan is like the spirit of lust;
And if only the nights were days,
Then, i would be able to see your face better.
You came and took my heart away!
But if only distances were closer,
Then, i could have crossed over to meet you;
However, the Spirit of Satan is like the spirit of lust.
