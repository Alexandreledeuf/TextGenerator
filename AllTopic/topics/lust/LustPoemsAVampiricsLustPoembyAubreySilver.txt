eyes the color of gold
there is a story that must be told
a passionate soul that is true
could i be the one for you?
within the darkness of night there is a secret i must hide
could you be the holder of my pride?
through the paleness of life,
you will never let me bring down my knife
with you buy my side i may never die
because i make you form a gentle sigh...
you tell me i have no strife
but what is the point of immortality if you deny your self the simple pleasures in life
the immortality i declare is not the answer so beware
