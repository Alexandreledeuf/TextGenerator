A night of lust and love
Brush your lips against my neck
And so begins your siren trek
I will obey your call and beck
Am I your paladin?
With my heart do I placate
But with your eyes, you dominate
Fairest maiden, single magnate
Wield me with a passion
Let thy heart be true and clear
Let me love you without fear
Let our souls entangle, dear
Let this be the night
Thus, the stars shine in the sky
Thus, the moonstone rises high
An audience to pain's demise
Embrace your loyal knight
Gently, graze the skin with lust
You smile sweetly; vouch your trust
I then advance; a gentle thrust
A sigh of ecstasy
Tongues engage, a lustful duel
Yet, you win! Oh, how cruel...
Arch for me, my precious jewel
Be this destiny!
Eyes hold fires, raging flames
Lover's passion can't be tamed
Sinful fires! I'm not ashamed
Fury in our love!
Harsher breathing as I drive
Gods! I've never felt so alive
Our souls, now, cannot be rived
The stars envy above
Harder, deeper, slower grinds
A feeling that just blows my mind
I hiss your name and say your mine
The fire consumes us
As we thrust and grind and kiss
I call your name, everlasting mistress
You call my name in utter bliss
The climax of our lust!
A flood of light! We both explode!
We grasp each other and tightly hold!
A cry of impulse thus untold!
We collapse upon each other
Now you gently kiss my lips,
and gently, lovingly sway your hips.
I'll taste your nectar in gentle sips
We truly love one another
