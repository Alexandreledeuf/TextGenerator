A love so secret, veiled and dark,
Hidden deep within my heart.
Yet I think I may be wrong
About my heart, my love, my song;
Is it naught but lustful yearning?
A base desire my heart is learning?
Is it love or is it lust?
To find the truth I think I must;
Search my black and tattered soul,
And make the truth my one true goal,
Until at last my colours show.
But, I guess, till then I'll never know.
