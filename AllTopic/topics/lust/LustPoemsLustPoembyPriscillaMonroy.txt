To feel your hands once again
To feel your warm breathe on my neck
To feel your lips on mine
To see in your eyes the longing for me
I tell myself this is the last time
For you have a commitment and so do I
In your arms each time I die
Can there be love in our lust
I will not do this again
But around you, myself I cannot trust
We know this cannot be
So stop this now before they see
But then you run your fingers through my hair
And caress my face
This is to much for me to bear
This flame we make is just to bright
It will consume us
If  we donâ€™t stop this very night
Knowing what we have will not last
For they hold our hearts
Our future and our past
So  we kiss once more knowing this has come to its end
We can no longer be lovers
Not even friends
