She wont eat
And she can't sleep
Lonley nights
Horrid fights
Pain wahses over but scars don't heal
What you give me is what i feel
Come and hold what  you can't catch
Want to know who is best?
I will show you what to see
All you have to do is trust me
Three words of passion dont mean much
When all you want isnt love
Dont use me or bruise me
whats mine is mine
And im willing to let it shine
With what i have and what i need
It's ok when you have speed
A few times you won't rememeber
Tonight or tomorrow
Let go of your sorrow
