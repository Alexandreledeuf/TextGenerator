O Lust! you're burning holes in our affair.
We lost our brazen face without a care-
Flaunting all in front of those who scowled,
Laughing at the doleful - e'er we howled!
Ironically, our sneering turned inside
To out the damage, tear apart our pride.
We saw we'd fallen for the devil's dust!
So let's in shame the blade to take and thrust!
