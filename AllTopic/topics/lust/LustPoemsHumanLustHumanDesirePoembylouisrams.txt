If beauty is only skin deep as they say
Into your body I would find a way.
I would pull out the beauties that
you have locked up inside
Beauties that you try to hide.
You would be the bread and I would be the jam
And I would cover you every way I can.
I would be on you like white on rice
And do everything nasty, but nice.
I would love you from the bottom
of your feet to the top of your head
You’d be so worn out, you would think
That you was dead.
Lovemaking can be vulgar or as beautiful as can be
It will bring you to a point of ecstasy.
The excitement will make your body sweat
Better than that it can’t get.
Human lust- human desire
There is only one thing that
Can put out this fire.
To fill that crave- to fill that need
Until you dropp that little seed.
And when that happens a child is conceived.
A child is born because of this desire
And then it ignites another fire.
A fire to protect this child so rare
Now that you have it with someone to share.
