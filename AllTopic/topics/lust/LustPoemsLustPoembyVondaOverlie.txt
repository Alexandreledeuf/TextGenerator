My body yearns for you, craving your hungry touch.
Igniting a fire within me I never wanted you so much.
My passion continues to bulid, You take me to the very top
Lost in sheer ecstacy, I never want you to stop.
Waves and waves of pleasure coarse through my  hungry veins
Escalating me even higher, the animal so hard to tame.
You play my body like an instument, a genius at your craft
Strumming with delicate ease, every note right on it's path.
Climbing even higher, we finally reach the peak.
Hanging  on with all my might, I can harldy speak.
My body starts to tremble and shake with pure delight.
Traveling to pleasure land, what a way to spend the night
