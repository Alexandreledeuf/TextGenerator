SENUALITY AND LUST
esspeecee …09.06.09
Extramarital affair
Tipsy; I fall-in
Often and
Effortlessly, compulsively.
It’s not lust
To gratify
But douse, drench
In beguiling Sensuality.
A tankard-full
Golden sun ray
Orangish archisap
Sip the sparkle
n’sip
Inebriate become
O Orangish Sensuality.
Smear Sensuality
A fragranced jelly
An intimate togetherness
With fiancée
Sing:
Hulla huh u laa hulla.
Take orangey transfusion
Of Sensuality
All cells are bathed
Melts down lust
Tranquility imbues me.
Lust gyrates, explodes
Repressed gratification surfaces,
Make me
Civilized libidinist.
Sexitation slumber
Under blanket of
Serene Sensuality
Like doped sloth.
I sip the tankard
Frothy, bubbly
Lips in commune with
Softy smoothie Sensuality.
Lust forgive me
Fear your
Grotesque laughter
Boozer of soma.
Lust is concocted
Groomed, vamped
Nudity
Product of civilization.
Sensuality is
Effortless, born-nascent, innate
Nudity
Pre-civilization gleam galore.
O Sensuality
My placid play pal
Stay even short
With me
Endlessly I relish
It’s ‘After-Taste’.
Orangey golden Sensuality
Drink you compulsively
I’m, for ever new
Extramarital affair
Die hard I’m of.
