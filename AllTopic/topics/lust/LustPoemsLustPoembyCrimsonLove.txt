I want your body, I want your mind
I want you with me all the time,
I pull you close, I feel a shiver
this puddle of lust, is now a river,
your lips are parted and ready for me,
our lips come close and brush gently,
I look into your eyes...you tell me your ready,
I kiss down your neck, bieng very steady,
You tell me stop teasing......but your pleasure will grow
Our loves blossoming with every touch, She's screaming with pleasures that she needed so much.
Her body writhing from the gift that has been given.
She lie there enthrawled in ecstasy, she grips my arms and kisses me,
she whispers 'better than my fantasy'
I kiss her neck and hold her tight..
and whisper back 'id hoped I'd do it right'
