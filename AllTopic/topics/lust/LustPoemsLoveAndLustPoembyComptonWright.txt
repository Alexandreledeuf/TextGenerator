Many memories flow through me like blood of a scholar
Or the winds of Mother Nature whispering in your ear
Making you calm watching love in the making creating
A new phenomenon we called love and passion in out lives
Unstoppable pursuit of happiness of everlasting love combines
In our dreams which we continue to lay out and configure
Our puzzle in the meaning of life or to see how it’s plays out
What’s makes it tick or makes it embrace itself upon us
Is it through our five senses we have premonitions in our everyday life?
I say that love have no limits of age, words, or actions to express it
From the cities, to the plains, all the mountains where it’s touch the clouds
I searched, entwined, tasted, touched and embrace love in the craftiest ways
From the times I have my heart broken by love was because love
Got her heart ripped and used than stomped in a million pieces
Don’t blame her for her feelings she past upon you and your lover
Blame lust for his devilish, sneaky, and dangerous game of sex
Hooked only in the beauty, the disgraceful greed of an “gold digger”
And the adrenaline of the rush of creeping for only to cheat and betray
So with that said it’s like yin and yang you’ll both Love and Lust
To bring balance in this world, the faithful ones and the cheaters that walks
This earth but one question I must ask my readers… which one would you choose?
The faithful love inside your soul or the lust exciting your life with danger…You decide!
