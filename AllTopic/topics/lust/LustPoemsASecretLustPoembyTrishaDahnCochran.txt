You glance over and smile,
A smile just for me,
I return it.
But I wish yours,
Meant the same as mine.
There's a hidden passion,
I can't let out.
I have to hold back,
My body screams for you,
I can't get you off my mind.
I wanna be more than friends,
I wanna be everything for you,
But I don't know how you feel.
So I've got to keep it,
To myself,
My secret lust.
