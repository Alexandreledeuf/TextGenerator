Sweetheart...
come...
we are alone now...
finally we are...
come and close the door...
i have many things to tell...
and have many desires for you...
come let me undress you all...
and hold you between my arms...
to hug you to my chest so strong...
and to start kissing you...
kissing you with my thirsty lips...
which missed you sooo...
to start from your neck and then down...
down till i reach the holy place where you care about...
to give you a happiness which you missed from a long time...
and to start the great love...
the love which we created for...
come, , my room calling you...
my warm bed missing you soo...
please give me the gift which god gave you...
so come to me sweetheart...
to let your body heal...
open up every thing you have...
breathe the good you feel...
breathe in joy and feel the warm from me...
to get from each one the lust...
the lust which we need to...
