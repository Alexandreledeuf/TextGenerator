Well designed hearts
In the sands in deserts
Drawn by the fingertips
Of the so-called lovers
Crossed on the curves
To stay forever together
Supposedly on the hills

Devotion kindlings set fires
In the souls in return
Naked flames of romance
Which swallows faithful lovers
Blessedly eternal
May be sometimes blaze or shimmer
Brightens the life
As it rise heart horizon in heavens
Breeze waltz with grains of the sand
And flames in summers
Flames are flared
Patterns are vanished in second
Do unveil that breeze
To find its real face which differs
Its elapsing time
As imposter of wind on the earth
Passing time substantiates
love claims if real
