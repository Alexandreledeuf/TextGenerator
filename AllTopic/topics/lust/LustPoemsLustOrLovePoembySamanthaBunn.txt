Some say they believe in
love at first sight…
I scoff at those who see the
truth in this.
Love is an acquired thing,
you can't love someone you just
laid your eyes upon.
Lust, on the other hand is an
instantaneous thing,
an almost life threatening thing.
Lust causes babies and disease,
It is hard to tell the difference
Between the two…Love? Or lust?
That is something you will know when it happens,
Love doesn’t come easily, Lust does.
