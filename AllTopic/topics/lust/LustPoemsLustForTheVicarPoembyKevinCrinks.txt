He's just too 'touchy feely'
He gets too close to me
He gets a kiss from all the girls
From six to eighty three
But I don't think he likes me
He avoids all my advances
'Cos deep down it would be a thrill
To get a priest's romances
I'm really not that jealous
Though he never meets my gaze
Perhaps he's hoping my desire
Is just a passing phase
Perhaps I should leave well alone
As a Christian woman oughta
Instead I'll try to fix him up
With my unmarried daughter
