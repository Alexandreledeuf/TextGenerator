Including in a meaningless act
Lust
Expressing and enjoying various energies
Diversity, variety and spontaneity
Grounded ambitions an truthful pursuits
Love
All you think is thighs and elongation
Passion marks and intimate sparks
Warm wet spots and warm long darts
Lust
Thoughts of “the other” permeate your daily activities
Embraces feel better than sensual encounter
Togetherness, and admiring all of your mate
Love
These terms might lead in
Freaky
Nasty
Tasty and sneaky
If it’s not present from the line read above
Check the actions and intention if you really know the difference between Lust and Love
