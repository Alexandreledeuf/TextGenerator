Lust, a burning, searing flame
that creeps through your veins.
Lighting you up with a hot,
fiery passion, it moves ever so quickly.
A feeling to love or hate,
It makes you feel so alive.
It is a sin, a lovely yet...
deadly sin, burning ever so fast.
Lust is love, lust is passion
Lust is many things...
Yet it is mainly just,
what it is, lust...
