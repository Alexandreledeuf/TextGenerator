They say
Death is not what it seems
It does not replace the screams
in your dreams
It does not resolve those problems
that linger along with dread
All these years Ive had
of hate
of rage
of pain
of sorrow
With one swift movement
I could no longer be here for tomorrow
and I laugh at all the saints
because they know of all this hate
if death never solved
the desires we have
or took away our pain
Then why do so many
end thier lives
because of all their hate
Why do people run
and fear it
When death is nothing but a limit
I could, could take my life today
to show these people
How Im made
To prove them wrong
to watch them cry
Blood lust
is not a crime
and as i lay here
dabating my fate
you all laugh
and scream out
'what a fake! '
But wait and see
for I am me
and the things I think
are not what you may seem
so once again
I point and sing
blood lust
is not a crime
Now what do you think!
