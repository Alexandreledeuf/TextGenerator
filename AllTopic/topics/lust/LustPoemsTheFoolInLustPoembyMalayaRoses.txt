Are you blind or eyes were gone
In lust or many more
To grab the dust of grass
Filling your never ending desire
Craving for nothing that you deserve
And why I am suppose to die
Upon you unholy feet
Love is dead
On the day this face was smudged with your lies
Calling no name and I know one
Dear heart was broken and I must get you forsaken
Until the end of time!
