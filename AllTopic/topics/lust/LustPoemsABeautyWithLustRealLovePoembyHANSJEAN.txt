Jealous ones get (envy)     upon a beauty,
A beauty that has swiped two souls,
One soul wiped by true love,
The other soul is snaped by lust..
Blinded souls lay in streams of hope,
Hope that breeze winded desirous cupidity,
Love scopes spirits relently in  bedevil ways,
Rays of burden burns me deep emotionally,
Emotion is deleterious upon (weepy)     hearts,
Heart is ferociously >attacked< with fake love,
Holler of vociferation utterance has left me killed...
just to give you guys a heads up
a word to everyone true love
can make you happy or sad
depends upon the person u love
