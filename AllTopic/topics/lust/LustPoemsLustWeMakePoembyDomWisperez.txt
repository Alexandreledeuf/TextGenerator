With-in my mind
I make the scenario,
this dance of devious temptation.
thus, I then lust for you.
with precision I make you
do my minds bidding.
I crave it,
thus, I lust for you.
Placating with steps
I tip-toe your body
through my mind,
and its progressions
make me Lust for you
I make you twist to my plans.
I make you mold to me.
This dance of devious temptation,
thus, I lust for you.
In closing I plead with you
to let me act,
to let yourself sin with me.
Thus, my lust comes real.
