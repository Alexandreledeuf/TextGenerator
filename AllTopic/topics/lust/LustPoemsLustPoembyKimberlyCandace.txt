I hear the words you say to me
I see the way you look at me
I know whats on your mind
At one time you were settled
down in mine
It's not the things you say to me
it's simply the way you look at me
Hard for me to look at you, into
the eyes of the one I could be
drawn to
We had the chance and
you stopped, you realized
what was true
That it was only an illusion,
a desire that we both share
something we both know
we can't allow to be true
Time has passed now and
it's starting again
But we can't let this happen
I've come to far now to sin
But your bold more confident now
you hang around like before
hoping to talk, to get me alone
the same way it started before
I can't let this happen but I don't
know if I could, addiction is only
lust it's about what feels good
So I'll back off because I don't
want to fail and the destruction
this would be, trust me I know a
thing or two about 'earthly hells'.
