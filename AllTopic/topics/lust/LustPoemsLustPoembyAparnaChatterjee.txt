Lust is what I speak tonight,
Lust is what I see tonight,
Lust is what I feel tonight,
And I Lust You.
Show me your Body
inside out…
no clothes on,
no holds barred…
bit by bit,
part by part,
give me your smells,
and your sweat…
give me what all you have
every naked bit of yours,
I want to see All of yours.
feel my hands
feel my legs
feel my torso
my body begs…
Come on me
and make me wet
juices flowing…
feel the heat…
together, we’ll
make ‘us’ meet.
If Lust be sin,
So be it…
For I am a Woman,
And you a Man.
How can I love you
and not lust you?
For Me,
Love and Lust,
go hand in hand…
for I am a Woman
and you are my Man.
