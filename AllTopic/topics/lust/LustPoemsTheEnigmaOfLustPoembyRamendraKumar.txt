The feel of your teeth
On my ear lobe,
Your nails
Raking a trail of red
On my back.
The slippery tango
Of our tongues.
Our nips and nibbles
All over,
Leaving no spot
A virgin
My hungry mouth
Ravishing,
The source
Of your elixir.
The not so gentle
Assault
Of your tongue
On my pride,
Pushing me to the edge…
As you pull me
Into you
Like a predator
Your eyes
Dilate
Like a victim’s.
Hard,
Soft;
Holding back,
Letting go;
Pleasure,
Pain;
Satiation,
Hunger….
The paradox
Of lust –
An eternal enigma.
