Straight from the gutters of hell!
She blows, sweeter than sugar
She burns,  flaming desires
Consuming all our emotions
Imitating the wings of love
Exciting and breath taking
Over flowing souls with her passion
Raging with infatuation
Hungry with an obsession
Not submitting to devotion
So powerful and strong
Luscious tasty desires
Never last a lifetime
But cause some a lifetime of pain
