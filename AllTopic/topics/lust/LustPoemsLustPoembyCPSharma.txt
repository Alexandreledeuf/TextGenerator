When on Vedas I concentrate,
Human passions come in spate;
From the Vedas take me away,
On my mind they hold sway.
Lust comes to me as a wild fire,
I am astounded with base desire(s):
Like a savage it lives at the root,
Am I a man or am I a brute?
****
But sapling of life from it sprout(s) ,
On its maturity love is the fruit;
Lust as seedling dissolves in dust,
Soon my love flowers in trust.
Its sweet fragrance removes disgust,
My whole world brightens up robust;
It is the basis of home and hearth,
In it lies all my mirth and worth.
***
Then it builds new castles of trust,
Thus I pass on from trust to trust;
Call it vicious or girdle girth,
Thus I wander birth to birth.
