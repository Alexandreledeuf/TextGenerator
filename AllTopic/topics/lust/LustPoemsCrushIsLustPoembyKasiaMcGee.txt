I once had a secret crush
People say it must be lust
they don't know the way i blush
This man is so kind
He will really blow your mind
i think of him every night
This crush just wont leave me
and i don't really know why
Maybe one day, the feelings will be free
and i wont have you to see
I want to make him understand
the way i feel for him
I want him to be my man
I don't really want to push it
But after that really long kiss
I could no longer resist it
it is every thing i wanted
I love him so very much
But I feel I will mess up
If I tell my secret crush.
I don't know if he will understand
my love for him it real
My love for you is secret
I weep when we are apart
If I open up my heart
It would rip our friendship apart
So I'll keep my love a secret
A secret of the heart.
