An angel of grace
With beauty to spare
Eyes of pure amber
And velvet soft hair
So lithe and so sleek
Her skin soft and white
A vision from heaven
A breath taking sight
Full of love and compassion
Faith and desire
She touches my heart
With fingers of fire
She harbours my soul
In sweet dreams of bliss
Awaiting with fervour
The touch of her kiss
To send me to heaven
Or condemn me to hell
This Russian roulette
Cast under her spell.
