Guardian angel
You came just
At the right time
Watching me is my guardian angel
You kept me alive all the time
I believe in my guardian angel
He watches me
There were times that were tough
There were days that I didn't know
If I would be alive
After all I've gone through this year
Guardian Angel
Stay and watch me
I like to have someone like you around
The light is shining
Twinkling, twinkling
Twinkling, star
Shining above
In the sky of
SÃ£o Paulo
Guardian angel
Don't leave me lonely
Protect me and guide me
Against all evil things
