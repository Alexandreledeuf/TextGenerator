the stars are in your eyes
the moon is in your lips
the sun is in your skin
it makes you glow...
just like an angel....
the angel in my heart
you keep it together when it starts fall apart.
cause your my angel..
my gaurdian angel...
your there through it all...
you catch me when i fall..
you never leave me behind
youre there waiting with me no matter the time...
