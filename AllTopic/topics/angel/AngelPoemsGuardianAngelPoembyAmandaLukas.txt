I owe my every effort to
Her love, everlasting and true.
In her silence, I am able to speak
and see all things beautiful.
She never left me.
She isn't gone.
I walk in solitude,
but never alone.
The angel watches me.
And in my dreams
she visits me
with a smile that's comforting
And in the morning, when I wake
I have her song to sing.
