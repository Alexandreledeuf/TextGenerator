As she walks through
the darkness
She feels the eyes
Burning a whole in her
She knows that its him
Her Dark Angel
Her protector
Her lover
Everything that she is
supposed to hate
But she cant help herself
Love is swelling inside of her
For her Dark Angel
Her handsome, sweet,
Dark Angel.
