You never stand alone
When your guardian angel is always near,
During the moments of trials and tribulation,
You will never be overcome with fear.
His presence may not be seen,
Regardless of where you are,
Rest assured that his halo is always shining
Like the brightest, heavenly star.
You never stand alone,
When in your heart you know,
Your guardian angel is your protectorate,
Who hovers over you and loves you so.
