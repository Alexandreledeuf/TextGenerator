There is an angel hiding in the dark
He is a sad one
Though he will not stop
Till he gets his mark
Though he still wont be done
Till he gets to the top
So there will be alot more deaths
Though he does get ticked
Cause his job will always go on
He will put to the tests
To measure how wicked
But that will not change the fact of him being a con
But be warned
For you will meet the fate
of all those mourned
This is in the Dark angels state
