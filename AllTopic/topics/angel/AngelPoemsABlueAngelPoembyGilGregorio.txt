Beyond every breath of heart
An angel draw a tear;
in her own way of sensing,
she gave the best of things.
She throw more bits of self
to satisfy her home at rest;
She gambled a bit of her own soul
staggered by the whims
of her own solace.
She recalled a covenant to him at best
to settle with her heart at rest.
A friend, yes am I to her from afar
who took her pains to find a peace impart!
