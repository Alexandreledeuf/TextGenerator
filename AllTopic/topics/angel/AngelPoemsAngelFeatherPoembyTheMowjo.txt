An Angel passed my way today,
And left a feather just to say,
I’ll help you, watch you, be your guide,
I’m always with you by your side,
And all the times when you feel low,
I’ll be your strength and help you grow,
And as you take these things from me,
Your eyes will open and you’ll see,
A whole new world begin to form,
A whole new world a brand new dawn,
