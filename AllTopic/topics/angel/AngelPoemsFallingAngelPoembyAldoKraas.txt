Falling Angel
Thank you for saving me from falling once again
God send us some sunny days and cloudy days also
Good night falling angel
And see you again tomorrow morning
Go and fly high
Let it shine above the cloudy sky
Falling Angel
You are wearing that beautiful dress with gold rim
That dress looks beautiful on you
It is one of a kind
I never saw anything like that before
