I saw an angel with a broken wing
I saw an angel cry
I mended it with bits of string
And told her she could fly.
I handed her my handkerchief
To wipe the tear away
And told her all was well again
I think I made her day.
She thanked me with an angel's kiss
And like a butterfly
She closed her wings then opened them
And rose into the sky.
Now she is back in heaven
And I'm here on the ground
And I think somehow that we got
Our roles the wrong way round.
