They plan the deaths of and murder people they do not even know
Which causes me for to wonder how this can be so
In their own sick minds they write their own laws
Is Humanity not considered in their political cause
They murder people guilty of only one crime
To be in the wrong place and there at the wrong time
When they call themselves freedom fighters they have got it all wrong
A freedom fighter to their group would not wish to belong
They hardly would know what freedom is about
And their very sanity one has to doubt
To live free of fear is a basic Human Right
And even of such a freedom they do gladly make light
Of and they are a disgrace to Humanity of them one can say
And to Karma for their crimes a huge price they must pay.
