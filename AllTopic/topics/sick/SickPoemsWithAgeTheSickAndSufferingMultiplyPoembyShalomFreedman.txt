WITH AGE THE SICK AND SUFFERING MULTIPLY
With age the sick and suffering multiply
Also, the dead.
We carry with us
More and more sad stories
More and more pain
Of people lost.
We live in a world of prayer for them
And sadness at their not being here.
We do not grow old alone
But with all those we have cared for.
Life is not easy,
And we go on as we go on.
