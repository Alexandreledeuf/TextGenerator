im so sick and tired of all this s***
of crying and people throwing a fit
Im so sick and tired of all this bleeding
of cutting and people not caring
im so sick and tired of drama
of the gov't and obama
im so sick and tired of tears
of crying and stupid a** peers
im so sick and tired of boys
of them treating girls like useless toys
im so sick and tired of ryhming
screw it,
im so sick and tired of being told what to do
im so sick and tired of being so sick and tired
but the most thing that im so f****ing tired of
is sobing and having the only comfort of empty echoes
