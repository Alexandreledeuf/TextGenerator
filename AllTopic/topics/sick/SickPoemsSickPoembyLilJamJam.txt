I’m sick and dying slowly,
But don’t say goodbye to me.
Because i don’t wanna think of leaving you,
But inevitably i will when my life is through.
The cancer’s quickly spreading through out my body and mind,
And we are also losing our special bind.
The chemo’s left me tiered and week,
With hardly enough energy to speak.
But i hope you can let go of me and dry your eyes,
When i finally lose the fight and meet my demise.
Because i want you to be happy and free,
Living the rest of your life without grieving me.
