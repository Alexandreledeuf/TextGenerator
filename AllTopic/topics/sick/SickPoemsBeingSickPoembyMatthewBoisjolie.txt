With the light of the day, and the promices you made, to the memories of the future, and you just keep them all inside, emotions, life, love and respect, both you and me, we both fall to the floor, and you spring up, while im trapped in this memory, keeping a steady pace as you walk away and i just close my eyes, trying to hold the weight of the world on my shoulders, im not upset, im not angry, im not gonna let you take me down, gain access to my heart, and hurt me again, your trying to pretend your someone your not anymore, and with the way i feel, it will seal your fate, and when things go wrong, your prtend it's not real, you distance yourself, and put up a fake face, just to get into me, engulf my heart, and charr it, I won't let you, im weighing my options, no matter what you say, ill never be there with you, im not your puppet, you dream of tomorrow, another day to infect me with you virus, i evolve to be immune to your sickness.
