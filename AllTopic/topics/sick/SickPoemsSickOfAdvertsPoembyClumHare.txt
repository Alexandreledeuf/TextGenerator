Adverts? asks the television
Again.
I switch it off
in a spasm of white noise
and leave the scene.
Behind, it comes lurching out of the bath
blood stained focus says
adverts
Must have forgotten the freeview.
Unplug at the wall.
(Note; if you haven't seen 'Fatal Attraction' the bath reference may not make much sense)
