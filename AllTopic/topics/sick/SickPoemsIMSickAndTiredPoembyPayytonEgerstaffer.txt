I'm sick and tired of being trained
To only love the things you’ve stained
I'm sick and tired of leaving behind
Little pieces of me which you’ll find
I’m sick and tired of faking my smiles
And wishing for the pain to go away for awhile
I’m sick and tired of listening to the rain
And counting each pill I take for my pain
I’m sick and tired of grouping for life
When all I want to do is end this strife
I’m sick and tired of loving you
Only to have you say “love ain’t true”
