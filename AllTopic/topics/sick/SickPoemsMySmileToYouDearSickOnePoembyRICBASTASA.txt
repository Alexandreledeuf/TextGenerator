it is something that i will give
on my own free will to you
you do not buy it. you cannot steal it.
you are sick and we know it.
you do not wish any cure. and we too know that.
you wish for the time to come.
it will. like a scheduled date. like what you always do.
fulfill a promise. and never be afraid.
you walk alone. that is what you like best.
you talk alone. that is your way of making the poems.
i have nothing to give. you do not know how to ask.
you do not ask for anything.
i am giving you, this smile.
that last one for you. you never ask for it.
i am giving it. willingly.
goodbye. as you close your eyes, i do not expect
that you smile back.
it is enough. now sleep.
