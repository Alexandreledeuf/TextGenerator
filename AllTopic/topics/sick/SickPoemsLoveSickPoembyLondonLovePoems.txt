You soothe my heart, Immersing my body
in your love.Gently you bathe my soul.
Washing away past pain.You centralise
my feeling without words that many believe
they should say.Before I was lovelorn.
Unhappy because my heart was torn.
But now, I'm love sick. Pinning, I feel weak
ill with all the love I feel.
