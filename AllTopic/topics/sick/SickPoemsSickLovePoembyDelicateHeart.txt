My pillow is so wet,
my eyes are too red.
my soul is wounded and hurt,
I shouldn't have listened to my heart's alert.
I am a victim of love,
I am weak, I'm a dove.
scold me, hang me and shoot me to death,
I am sorry I have fallen in your love in this earth.
stretch your delicate hands, pluck out that damned heart,
Burn it, melt like ice and take it apart.
Purified heart, only then I can stop loving you,
You are a snapshot of heaven's view.
I cann't take my eyes from yours,
you're the one I chose.
I'll love you  now and after I am not alive,
Your lovely smile inspires me my whole life.
I am crazy about your eyes,
that have many ties to heaven and skies.
free your soul, let it embrace mine,
This is how I felt when I met u the first time.
When I experience the softness of your rosy lips,
my heart goes out of my chest and slips.
you're the perfect combination of sexy and cute,
Hold my hand warmly and let's take our fated route.
I am old, a worn-out patient.
Hold me so tight, you're my last love station.
Whisper in my ear.
Let me enjoy and hear,
the soft sound of your  voice,
love me, hold me and rejoice.
