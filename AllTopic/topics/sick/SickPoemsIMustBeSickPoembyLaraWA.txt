Dadadada I’m so happy
Got a text message
Which cured me like tranquilizers.
The magical reaction is filling up my bones;
Charming my instability,
And balancing my lack of empathy.
Now I’m grinning like a sick
Non-manic depressive.
“School closed for two days.
Tell the others,
See you on Monday.”
Bwahahaha
Many gratitudes to
The forests in Sumatera
Thank you for burning
Yourself down,
And letting the haze
Shroud my city.
(And the doctors are making a lot of money too)
I’m coughing
My eyes are twitching
I’m tasting the smokey air
And my throat is sore
But I’m not taking this smile off,
Na ah! You can’t make me.
Woo-hoo
How nice
Many intangible benefits
I can exploit.
No need to scream for attention;
(I'm sick, baybeh!)
And
Of course I will exaggerate for sympathy!
Ahh yes,
Being unwell is so liberating sometimes.
(I can't wait to hide under the blankets)
