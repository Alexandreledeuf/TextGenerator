A SICK MAN’S POEM IS A SAD POEM
A sick man’s poem is a sad poem
Walking, it is out of breath -
It stops and wonders at all the powers it took for granted
It no longer has now-
It wants to be home in bed lying down-
A sick man’s poem wants to sleep
And not care that it any longer is -
It wants rest quiet silence peace and no pain-
A sick man’s poem is out of breath too soon
And wants to lie down.
