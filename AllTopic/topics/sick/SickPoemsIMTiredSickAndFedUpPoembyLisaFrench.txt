I'm tired of being the girl
Who's always left out
I'm sick of being the one
Who's always put down
I'm fed up with you
And all the insults you say
What have I ever done to deserve this?
It cuts really deep
With hurt and pain
I'm not taking it anymore
I'm not running away
I've never done anything
To hurt you in anyway
I'm tired, sick and fed up
Now, I don't care what you say
