HOW CAN POETRY HEAL THE SICK?
How can Poetry heal the sick?
When the sick can no longer speak
The Poetry within them?
How can Poetry heal
Those who can no longer hear it?
How can Poetry be anything
When the suffering person
Barely has a mind anymore?
God has given us Poetry
A Great Blessing -
But like all God has given us
At certain times
It simply is not good enough.
