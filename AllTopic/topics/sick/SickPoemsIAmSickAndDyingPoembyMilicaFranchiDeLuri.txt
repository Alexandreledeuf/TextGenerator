I am sick and dying
on my death bed i am lying
no one is sad
no one is crying
They eat, drink and are merry
asking questions;
Is it cheaper to burn or to bury?
I said;
'Somebody call the doctor! '
' I am sick, i am dying! '
They called the priest
to spray me with holy mist,
to get me ready for the next life
They don't want me to go into any more strife.
I said;
'Somebody call the doctor! '
'I am sick, i am dying! '
They said;
'Your last will and testament
where is it hiding?
Now that you are dying,
you are not gone need all that money.
You'll be in haven
There are rivers of milk and honey! '
I said;
' I am filing better now!
I am not sick, i am not dying
to take my money, stop trying.
I am going to dig it out of the hole,
I'll go shopping and spend it all.
I'll by my self a brand new car
To celebrate, I'll smoke a cigar
I'll go on holiday and drink champagne.
When i get back I'll start a campagne.
All retires who don't like milk and honey
join the grey army.
Start spending your kids inheritance,
start spending your hard earned money'
This poem was written after a story i watched on current affair.
