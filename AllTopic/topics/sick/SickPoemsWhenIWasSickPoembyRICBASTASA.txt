i was thinking about a lot of things
messy things like
a pool of thread being played
by the kitten at the
living room and the dogs
were flying kites
the mice are taking all the
cheese,
i was thinking about a lot of poems
with gentle faces
wearing straw hats on the beach,
a lot of stories with eyelashes
curling
and lips lusciously
biting each other,
when i was sick they tell me i was sick
my mind is sick
and i am not aware about the sensitivity
of the situation, which i always
consider
as nothing but another form of
temporary
sensuality,
i was thinking about
my favorite dish
and those who dine with me
their hands
inside my pants.
