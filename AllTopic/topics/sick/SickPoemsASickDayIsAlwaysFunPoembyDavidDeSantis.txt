Why did I go out last night?
Maybe living alone,
and being at home
forced me to follow to you.
Or the excuse of a meal,
Every good deal,
Is better once
a beer or two
Why did they find me at the bar?
I was ready to leave,
And then a reprieve
“we’ve got plenty of beers up there”
Why can’t I say,
to my dismay,
“work, and I must be aware”
Why did I shotgun that beer?
Wasn’t it enough,
To drink and play rough
And why race to find some cheer
I’m not a quitter,
I’m always a winner,
And its easier to chug cold beer.
Why did I hit on that girl?
Couldn’t you see
She was not free
Her boyfriend made sure you did.
Your too old to fight,
Yet it happened last night,
Thank God you cheap shot that kid.
Why did I dance on the bar?
Don’t you think
That winning the pink
Is more difficult than being a fool?
I’m not quite sure
But after staying alert
A celebration was called for too.
Why did I kiss a townie?
You my young friend
Aren’t as dumb as you pretend
She’s twice your age atleast!
Oh well I think,
With each coming drink,
More like a model
less like a beast.
Why did I stay at her house?
And now you awake
Her kids are a play
One is already at school
Two are in college
Learning some knowledge
While mom sits on top of you
I’ve said this before
I’ll say it some more
Don’t ever go out of your way
To stay out at night,
And get into fights.
And work,
lets fake it today.
