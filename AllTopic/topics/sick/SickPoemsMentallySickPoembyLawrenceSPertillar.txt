When imbeciles are encouraged,
They take pride in the mounting of ignorance.
Listening to others is a joke to them.
They have ridiculous actions figured out!
Planning escapades with supporters...
They find a way to make common sense
A challenge to keep afloat!
For those who have long divorced themselves
From nonsense!
Even though they vote...
To discover themselves choking,
On ethnic jokes provoked!
Watching folks accept being duped and doped!
And it is the burden of those with senses left,
To find fresh creative ways to explain
'How' they could allow such bullshit to exist...
To sustain and maintain.
As they become more addicted
To pretending they too...
Aren't mentally sick!
Although they follow fools
Whether poor or rich,
Out of habit!
Showing signs they are clearly insane,
With their empathetic static!
