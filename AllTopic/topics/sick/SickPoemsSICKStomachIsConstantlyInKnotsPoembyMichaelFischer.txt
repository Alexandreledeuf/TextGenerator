Here I come
Extend your ridicule
Expose me
To the group
And get your money's worth
On my knees
The spotlight exploits me
My head sinks
Inside my hands
While tears fill the cracks
And as I sit here shipwrecked
I drown in emotions
In waves of crimson rage
and ebon misery
But waiting long to be saved
I swim from no man's land
Drifting far from the shore
And out of your net's reach
The riptide
Of non-conformity
Swaying me
Back And forth
Has made me sick of you
Don't save me
Save yourselves
