Hooray for me, no really, I'm so delighted you speak to me but, would you kill me in my sleep?
you wouldn't dare, your life has no value to me except cash value. lovers so overwhelmed with love for one another. you can't live without each other.
love sick puppies
options are endless to end the pain inside, here are just a few ideas for 'eternal love'
lay in the tub together, your bodies as one....so just....meaningful
love sick puppies
drag a blade across each other's wrists, now bleed all of the love you have into the tub
here's another option for my lil pups
so in love you are
make sweet love for the last time, look each other in the eyes, whisper i love you
then take a 45 and at the same time hold it to the others temple. pull the triggers
love sick puppies
you have done the right thing
so, i will do my thing
i am the 'CLEANER'
i will collect payment from...hum...your parents insurance policy
put on the respirator, tyvek suit, and pull what is left of your head from the ceiling and walls
bag it, tag it, put your remaining pieces of 'eternal love' in a bio hazard box
love sick puppies
see you at the incinerator
