I am sick,
Sick of this pain,
Wishing my life will fade away,
Away to the nothingness I have become,
Always in and out of trouble,
Knowing how this hurts my dad,
Knowing that he is in pain,
Watching him cry,
It hurts me,
Watching him suffer,
Makes mee want to say how sorry I am,
I am sorry for all the things I have done to you,
I know my sorry's aren't good enough,
Yet I am willing to make it up to you,
I am sick,
Sick of this life,
Knowing how hard this must be to see my dad in pain,
How I wich I can take it all back.
