when you left me
i got sick
got really sick
for a long time
but i did not die
even when you
left me, got sick
and got sick for
more than i can
handle, but i
did not die
somehow i
got sick but
i cannot die,
i am alive and
soon i know
i will be in love
again, my promise
to myself, my
hope eternal.
spring, and new
moon, and change.
