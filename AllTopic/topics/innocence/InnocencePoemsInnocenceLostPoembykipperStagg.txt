Innocence lost!
All of his life people had beaten him down,
Made him feel useless,
Treated him like a clown.
Sweet Love met with a volley of blows,
A weeping Heart and a bloody nose!
Constant Abuse from a tender age,
Life left him bitter,
A heart full of rage!
No one to hear his impassioned cries!
No one to wipe all the tears from his eyes!
And now he's a man everything's stayed the same.
Living his life with a heart full of shame!
