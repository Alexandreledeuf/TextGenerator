hopefully it shall be your
last pose
beside an old Thai wall
that separate
the pure from the prude
the promiscuous from those
still wanting to be one
without thinking of any
possibility of unrest
or regret
now i must shed off my
hypocrisy
like a black coat on a warm weather
in this tropical part of
the world
i must accept, i am seduced
and i am throwing all my education away
naked, i plunge into the river of
my own destruction
now, the arms of oblivion shall embrace me
and history shall erase
the name that i have embossed
in the sands of my own
time
