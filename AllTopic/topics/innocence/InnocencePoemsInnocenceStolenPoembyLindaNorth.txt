You crawled into my bed
To make love for the first time
Then you asked for my help
You needed some more wine
You said I was the only one
To help you in this case
“Help me get my wife back”
You said with such disgrace
A friend from my teenage years
I was so naive and stunned
You could not have hurt me more
If you had shot me with a gun
You cried, you begged, you pleaded
“But you are my life-long friend”
I should have known that moment
This had to be the end
You stole from me something
That could not be replaced
My innocence gone forever
It hurt so much to face
I could have gone a lifetime
Never seeing that dark side
For years you and everyone
Had been so good to hide
