I lost my innocence.
Not once not twice but more times than I can count.
It was becuase of bastards.
Bastards who wanted to hurt.
I lost my innocence and gained pain.
On the day you raped me.
I lost everything.
Lost my innocence.
Lost my life.
Lost my happiness.
Lost my way of being.
You raped me.
You didnt lose anything.
You gained the power.
I lost every thing that day.
All I was to gain was pain.
I lost more than one thing.
I lost my innocence.
But gained the pain
