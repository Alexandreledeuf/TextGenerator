Invisibly travelling hoping for someone,
to release him from bondage, trapped like a abalone.
Emotionally handicapped for someone to hear his cry,
but yet everyone is deaf no matter how hard he try.
Pretending like he is gifted with wisdom,
Still helpless and trapped in his mighty kingdom.
Frisky and ill-fated the qualities of his whole,
thoughts gushing in his mind as he grows ole.
That when in this world there will be a candle with a light,
which can be seen by anyone without sight.
Sacrificing himself when all he can do is taunt,
left with nothing but only him to flaunt.
Sober at people who thinks he is a gloat,
like as if they were free birds in the sky who float.
Crying at people who tells him he is too servile,
but doesn't know whether it can be futile.
Thinking to himself who are they to decide,
on land or sea his wish to reside.
Beliving that God to him is not fair,
Waiting for that day when he senses there is no air.
