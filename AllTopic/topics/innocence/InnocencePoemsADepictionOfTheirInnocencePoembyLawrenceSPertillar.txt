People who describe themselves,
As repeatedly victimized...
Are always on the scene,
Providing the same evidence...
That never seems to change,
A depiction of their innocence.
And who has been abusive to them,
Offensive, cruel and mean.
'And you say,
You have no idea why this has happened? '
~I wish I had a 'hint' or a single clue.
Everyone else accepts what it is that I do.~
'Everyone else but just a few, huh? '
~What do you mean by that? ~
