Lay me down tonight.
Don't mourn for my passing.
I sold my soul to evade the light,
There's nothing left worth redeeming.
I remember a time,
Smiling child, picture of perfection.
In joyous resplendence, you danced.
Born in day,
But even your light wasted away.
Lay me to rest tonight.
Don't weep for my losses,
I sold my heart to escape the pain,
There's nothing left of me to save.
I remember a time,
Foolish child, see what befalls the flawed?
In the absence of light, you changed.
Born in day,
But reality eroded your heart away.
Hide me away tonight.
Don't beg for my forgiveness,
I took my life to escape from you,
Theres nothing left of me
Tonight.
