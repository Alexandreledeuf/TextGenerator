Re-collect
Re-ligio
A high tide of returning faith
For the age of innocence
Le fin de toutes les ciecles
Weltschmertz too shallow for those
Who went abysses too high
Who went insanity too nigh
Go up
Super-modern stuck in
Heideggerian states of minds
Without even knowing that
New health be named after you
Carry the name the peace of glory
You sub-modern undercurrent
Talking to its future
Gather together
Powers of the world
Light up little girls’ golden matches
Re-collect little boys lost in no man’s host
Gather together and strike
Dancing light on fragility
Delicate wire walkers
Scar lit star dust dancers
Spinning ashes spread
Spread beyond the waters
You sub-modern undercurrent
Talking to its future
Re-collect
Memories of Earth risen grown up
In knife edges shortcuts torn apart
Dying a Nietzche strength in
‘they’ll call me a sickness’ testament
Michael Angelo mocking
Bartholomeus’s skin
The Moses horns bone bricked
Into the creation of Earth
Re-collect
Re-ligio
The high tide of returning faith
For the age of innocence
This is an unknown passion
A torment passion tearing to nothing
Torn to nothing brought
Torn out of nothing born
Reborn
Unmasking darkness and light
Un-dividing
A new health may carry its name
To say
To re-collect
Gather together and strike
Light steps of the paths
Stamps in sounds star bathed blessed
Sub-modern last choice manifest
Re-collect
Re-ligio
The high tide of returning faith
For the age of innocence.
