Like a seagull flying high,
As I hear your distant cry.
Not of pain but of suggestion,
Wait for me is the question.
Gliding down with all concern,
The bird I found will take its turn.
Disguised in innocence and great meekness,
My ignorance becomes my weakness.
Plucking feathers from my wings,
It’s unnoticeable, for innocence she sings.
Shaded by deceptions peaceful nature,
Now my trust she will capture.
Follows me down to the vigorous sea,
And still in her eyes you see purity.
Sending vultures to eat my soul,
I’m struggling up as you call.
Gliding up to the surface,
The sea water has revealed her purpose.
My feathers are torn; they’ll grow back,
Deception’s innocence has now lacked.
