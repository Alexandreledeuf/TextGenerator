A precious child, my little grand-daughter,
full of chuckles, love and great laughter.
Filled with innocence through and through,
with lots of hugs and kisses too.
I know proud grandparents will all agree,
the love we receive is precious and free.
They have no motives, no deep held secrets.
Holding on to us tight, cradled in our arms
filling us with a calm of their innocent charms.

arms is one of the most peaceful feelings in
the world”.
