Secrets, secrets
Lies, lies
She sits in her room,
and cries and cries.
There's no more trust
In this girl's heart.
She finally found out
That life isn't perfect.
She lived in dreams,
As children often do.
But she crawled out
Into the world everyone knew.
Things that once were.
Happiness once known;
The truth of it all.
To her was shown.
Her little heart
Will never trust again.
She'lll never know
A real true friend.
No more trust,
For no more lies.
She'll sit in her room
And cry and cry
