Secrets hidden well,
To cover up the shame,
Memories suppressed inside,
To bring relief from the pain.
Nightmares constantly present,
To remind that the past is real,
Sickness retching the body,
To release the disgust she feel.
Pasts that still haunt,
Both at day and by night,
Lives forever altered,
By something far from right.
Child left alone,
Trying once again to be whole,
This unforgivable devastation,
Forever tormenting her soul.
Many questions yet unanswered,
She still sits and wonder why,
Was there a reason, a purpose,
To the cause of her wanting to die?
