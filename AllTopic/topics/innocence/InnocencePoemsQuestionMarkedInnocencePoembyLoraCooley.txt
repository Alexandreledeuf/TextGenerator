When we talked you promised
That you would never leave
Then I told you of the demons
And how they made me bleed
I made you promise crazy things
But your words weren’t enough
I couldn’t believe you loved me
I thought to love me was to tough
When I cry about my past
And say that I’m ashamed
I know that I am the one
Who is to be blamed
Then you hold me tight
And say that it’s okay
So I cry for my lack of innocence
And the things I couldn’t give away
When I can’t sleep through the night
And the memories start to hurt too much
I burn myself and tell you,
Because you’re the only one I trust
You say your better then you’re past
You tell me that I’m strong
You say that I’m the love of your life
But if you only knew
The kind of thoughts I think
And what I used to do
You tell me that it doesn’t matter
And that you love me anyway
So I cry for my stolen innocence
And the things I shouldn’t have given away
They all said my body lacked beauty
And it made my confidence fall apart
But when I let you look
You marveled at me like a work of art
I then held you close just to say
Remember this moment and don’t let it fade
So I cry for my question mark innocence
And the things I wish I gave away
I never felt a thing
Before I gave you my heart
And when those bad memories won’t fade
And I feel like I’ll fall apart
You will tell me you love me so
Then as you wrap your arms around me
And say you’ll never let me go
I know you really love me,
And you’ll keep me safe from harm
You know I’ve been hurt,
And abused in every kind of way
So I cry for my loss of innocence
And the things I gave away
