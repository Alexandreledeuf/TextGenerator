You toy with the idea
Of  being my Empathy
You congratulate yourself
For the humanity
You extend unto me
I smile at your eagerness
I marvel at your  youthful  face
I regret  the coming dawn which will
Denude you abruptly of all grace
My senile world
O innocent fairy
ill keep veiled in my silence
and let you  smile in your sleep
as deep as the gurgling Nile
while I stay up long into the dusks
and measure
the immeasurable..:
time.
