Innocent children..sexually and mentally abused! ! I stepped in their shoes and cried in pain.If you too feel the same, then step out and spread awareness among the kids.Listen to your child.Save innocence! ! 'Stop child Abuse'! ! !
I am a happy child
With a wonderful smile
I get good grades
The teacher’s apple-pie
My mummy loves me
My daddy alike
But when my uncle loves me
I so dislike
I hate the touch
When he touches my butt
He keens to unwrap
In the warmth of his lap
I feel scared to share
Do nothing in despair
My uncle is so big
His fingers, his fist
I get the penny for the pain
A chocolate, a dress, an express train
Those keep lying in the foyer
I wish to trash them
Being a destroyer
Oh mummy! If you could just see
What it has been on me
I get nightmares even in day
I will be out of this love someday
I am smiling, wish you could see me cry
I am dancing on a dead man’s choir
The sweet lullabies he made me hear
Hurts me and my cuddly teddy bear
If only you had been right close to me
You could have seen the dead child in me
If only you had ears, to hear my cries
I would have been the apple of your eyes
No red, yellow, green or purples
I am black
Wish I could build my rainbow of colours
And get my childhood back! ! !
