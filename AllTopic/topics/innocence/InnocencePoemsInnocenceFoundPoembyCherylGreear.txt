In a world where innocence is lost so quickly, I pondered if it
truly exists at all. Where does one go to find it . . . this freedom of a pure, existence amidst an age-old classroom called life who teaches that innocence is best ignored. It was when I stopped looking that I was able to "see" a world with an
abundance of innocence and I chose it for my guide. Stop for a
moment and watch nature. Listen to all that is to be heard; for , this is
the true teacher of all living things. The smell of a rose, the call of a
wolf, the sight of a bird in flight. Nature's untainted innocence is
responsible for all these things. Nature hears no voice but it's own; yet, speaks to all who will listen. A
voice as constant as a rising sun or branches swaying in the
wind . . . for these are the soft-spoken words of innocence.
