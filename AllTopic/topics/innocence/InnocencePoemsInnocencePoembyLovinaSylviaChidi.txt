Innocence!
He spoke once before
Innocence!
He rigged of in pleasant odours
Innocence!
He displayed with his first step on the dance floor
Not knowing
What was next or what was following!
When he bellowed, he bellowed
And his silence too was without pretence
Now knowledge has made its entrance
Gradually exhibiting its presence
And his innocence
Has dissolved into a distasteful fragrance
