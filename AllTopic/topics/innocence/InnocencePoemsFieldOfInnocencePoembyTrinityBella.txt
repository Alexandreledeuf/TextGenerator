Quiet.
Soft.
Full of peace.
No vandalism.
No wrong.
No sorrow.
No pain.
It's my field of innocence.
It's my life.
The place I dream about.
I know I am very young,
To early for me,
But when I pass.
I will go to this world.
Heaven,
Though, I like to call it field of innocence.
I don't know why.
Seemed fitting.
The innocent are there,
Resting in the quiet peace,
With our Lord Jesus.
I know someday I'll go,
And when I do,
I want to go to Heaven.
My Field Of Innocence.
