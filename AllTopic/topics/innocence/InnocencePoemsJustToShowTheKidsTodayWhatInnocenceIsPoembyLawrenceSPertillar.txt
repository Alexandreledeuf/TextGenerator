Remember those lollipops we liked alot and licked.
I remember licking every bit and saving the sticks.
Remember spending nickels to get five hot rockets.
Sucking those hot balls until the juice dripped from our lips.
Do you remember candy dots on strips of paper...
With every flavor there but chocolate.
Those times are gone but innocence should be held over.
Just to show the kids today what innocence is!
And...

There were many benefits to being young and innocent.
