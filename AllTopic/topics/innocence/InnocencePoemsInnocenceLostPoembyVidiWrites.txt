It’s my all time favorite repose-compartment
Open the pages to see my ingenuous chapters
Wonder why I have lost my innocence supplement
Once, that stance was part and parcel of all my matters!
Excavation can help me, I take this dig.
Cradle to grade one, infancy free verse at recite
From there a saga of tutoring, a phase of delight
Forever forgiven, naive menaces, a period of elite
It’s time then society norms dictate man’s plight.
Exclusive shots of this dig.
Its now, the virtue lost from face and it’s struck at throat
Costless thrillers, pastime, under the vigilant scanners
Salt water couldn’t heal the pain, but it did pivot
As a proof of living, had to hold pre-printed banners.
Extensive damage, reports my dig.
Discolored utterances played havoc, gullet to blame
Etiquette pushed into belly to help in digestion claim
Fed with indigestible cereals, system hanged in shame
The so called Innocence departed under the foot into the drain.
Exhibit of my dig –‘Innocence Lost’.
