“I have walked
a lot of dark streets
all over the world.”
“You have got
a lot of confidence.”
“How can you tell? ”
“It is in all
your mannerisms.”
“I may look a fool
but I am not.
I may play the fool
but I am not.”
“I may play the fool
but I lost the beauty
of youth’s innocence
at a younger tender age.”
“That is why I treasure
innocence so deeply.
A great actor disappears
in the art of invisibility.”
How few observe
raw social reality.
Truth written in echo lines
stage idealized actuality.
