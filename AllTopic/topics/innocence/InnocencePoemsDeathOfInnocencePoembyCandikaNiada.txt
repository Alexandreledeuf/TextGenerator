I am bound and broken,
Lying bloody on the floor.
No longer with innocence,
I'd had before.
I'll be forever changed,
By just one thrust,
A penetration of hatred,
To rip away my trust.
You abuse my body,
My soul and my mind.
With one careless shove,
You start to grind.
As you begin your assault,
I close my eyes.
Soon it will be over,
So sure I want to die.
My tears begin to fall
With each wince of pain.
I wonder why,
What have you to gain?
As I continue,
To push you away,
Your pace gets faster.
Your eyes turn grey.
Slowly you stop,
With one final thrust,
My heart is torn;
I no longer can trust.
I feel the hatred
Flowing into me.
Now so dirty with filth,
I seem to be.
You wickedly laugh,
As you rise from the floor.
You wipe yourself on me,
Then head for the door.
Now here I am
Beaten, Broken, and Bound,
Lying on the floor,
Uttering no sound.
