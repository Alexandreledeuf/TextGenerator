Innocence and silence.
A kind of state out of nature.
A head in a queer trance.
A body with a fracture.
Crying out the pain inside.
Showing out a grey smile.
A heart truly deeply died
Without blood running wild.
A crying silence growing.
A silent cry inside hidden.
A stare at the forbidden:
Words without meaning -
Innocence and silence.
