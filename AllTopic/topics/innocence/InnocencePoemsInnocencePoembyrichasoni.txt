i grew up to see
how cruel world can be
first step outside the home
oh! it was better in the womb
expected people to be
like in fairytale movie
but the truth is darker
more darker then i see
i ran after desires
only to get wounded knee
people live without a soul
no emotions i can see
i realise i havent grown yet
want to go back to the cocoon i left
yet i have to fight
to make tomorrow bright
sometimes in the fight
starving for the light
remember you can loose
the innocence inside
no matter i lose or win
innocence keeps me away from sin
yes, i'm holding it
deep down my skin
and the day i die
i wish i die with innocence still within..........
