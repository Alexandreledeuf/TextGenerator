Innocence stolen without my permission
Innocence gone without my submission
Innocence lost through another's plan
Innocence no longer for another man
Innocence turned to hatred and fear
Innocence gone, no man can come near
Innocence taken from a little girls heart
Innocence replaced by mistrust, you thought you were smart
Innocence dissapears like dew in the sun
Innocence faded before it's begun
Innocence obscured like a cloud over the moon
Innocence ripped away too soon
