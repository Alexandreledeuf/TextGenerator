I heard too many songs of love, and I'm sick of love
sometimes I lie to be like everyone
had you ever told someone a big lie?
and you had believed it
only one thing to be known, everyone lies
don't forget it
but some of them lie because they are breathing on lie
and some of them wants to be like everyone by lie
I'm the antilove, I'm the slayer venom, I'm the killing poison
I can pick my soul it falls in front of you
I don't want to be sweet innocent thing
innocence is weakness
only one thing to be known, everyone dies
don't you think it
but some of them die because they don't deserve life
and some of them want to die because they didn't live
hurry up and lock the door, look back if no one's there?
so, wear your escaping cloth, you can't run you can hide
just kill yourself because you're dead in my mind
you don't belong to me,  you belong to yourself
I lost my soul so long ago
