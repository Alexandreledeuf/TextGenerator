Oh lord forgive me
for what I have done
I know you shouldn't
go eye for an eye
but what would you have done
Listen to my confession
and tell me what I should have done
I see you in the morning
I see you in the night
I see your face
But I never see your eyes
You took away my innocence
You took away my life
I knew some day we'd meet again
But this time I'm a man
I saw you hurt someone
I said I'd die for you
then I pulled the knife and killed you
you took away my innocence
But I took away your life
