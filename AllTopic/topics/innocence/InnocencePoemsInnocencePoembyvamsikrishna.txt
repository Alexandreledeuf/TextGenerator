As the baby wakes frm his bed
he sees the world arnd him
wonders what is here and why it is,
he moves on to see things,
less complex to understand what is goin on
he understands only two emotions of love and pain
both of which stay with him in loss and gain
he conveys evrything in laughter and cry
like we grown ups have never bothered to try
the way he is and his innocence makes me wonder
ah wht a day to live afterall to see a boy of such wonder
his evry movement is observed with such care
tht even people dying want to glare
his laughter is such a medicene
tht  any  disease can be cured by it
