CRY OF INNOCENCE
Night when deep by the lightening
Rose yet promises the rambles of smile
darkness walks through the silence
rain still tears all mute by the blue
the waves yet dazing on the beach
call when defrayed by the impulse
love still snaffles by the crooning
moments seems to defuse by the bliss
the reeks when fester by knowing
when reconciled by the reef of reason
star yet blinks to its lap when swings
sun in its rise by the warmth in redolence
breath of silhouette yet subtle intoned
even intense by embracing the whispers
vale of tunes when shimmers from all secrets
the clogging undertones the cry of innocence
