^Death Of Innocence (2)
Playful laughter in a garden
Dark eyes flashing, curly hair
Infant innocence happy there:
'Dandelions, pretty flowers
Mommy, you and I can wear
Yellow tassels on our slippers;
Each of us have got a pair.'
Dark clouds gather in that garden
Shining sinister, slithering serpent,
Nonresistant childhood snare.
'Stolen candies, sweets are tempting
As I coil about your thigh.
Taste how sweet they are, like honey,
Like the secrets that we share.'
Secrets growing choke the flowers
Robbing laughter; until soon
Mother's heart must sadly sigh.
'Oh, my daughter, pretty daughter,
Gone the luster in her eye.
She is keeping secrets from me.
Why has she not told me why? '
Little girls grow to be adults
Childhood secrets scars become,
Scars that taint her every song:
'Why are candies venom bitter?
Why is laughter like a cry?
Why has happiness forever
Scorned me and passed me by?
'Within me lives a memory
That will haunt me 'til I die.
That will haunt me 'til I die.'
