Heart coalesces in unison longing love
distinction impulses unconsciousness
firmament loses to black hole redeeming
as river meanders to meld into oblivion.
attraction refutes falling from gravity,
anima, merges into promise of divinity,
gloss of innocence inflicts asymmetry
laws of truth guide universe onto eternity.
Light reflects to form image in mirror
genesis accords possibility to acknowledge
reality is ground of all creations to happen
as things happen to happen by inevitability.
