The innocence of war is a lie
there is no innocence in killing people
there is no innocence in destroying part of the world
murder of plants animals and many people
where is the innocence in that
More crimes and violence in this unholy cruel world
influenced on war
Death and Karma will come to all who
support this evil devilish thing, sport, crime!
The blood of many men drip on your hands
my hands
our hands
Familys departed over politics
new borns lifes already taken away by men they don't even know
its not there fault
its yours and mine because we don't
Listen! Hear! Speak!
save the life of the real innocence
