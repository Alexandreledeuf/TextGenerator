I met a little girl,
As fragile as could be
And i don't know somehow,
She reminded me of me!
In her little eye she saw a dream,
Of happiness unmatched
But every time she made it true
There came a little catch
And each time a little tear,
Would fall on her knee
But again and again she tried
For she wanted to succeed.
Her innocence was soon broken
In light of further days,
For every time she tried to smile,
Darkness pushed her away.
And though she broke entirely,
From within
Outside, she tried to put a show
And tried to mingle in.
And she tried to piece together
Her unhappy shattered heart,
But inside she was tearing
Slowly. part by part.
I met a little girl
As fragile as could be,
It's hard to belive, I know
That girl was me.
