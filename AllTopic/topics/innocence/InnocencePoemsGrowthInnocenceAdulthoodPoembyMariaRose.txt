Fuelled by my innocence
I was on my way to the adulthood.
I had my own pace
I never hurried and
I never wanted to.
Some people around me
seemed to have found that
I was too slow and decided to speed me up.
It was an unexpected night.
(Otherwise I would have fled)
I know, a rough footstep,
the stench of whiskey and
a pair of rocky hands
drained my fuel and speeded me
up to the adulthood.
I grew up to realize
that Death is deliverance
and growth is fatal.
