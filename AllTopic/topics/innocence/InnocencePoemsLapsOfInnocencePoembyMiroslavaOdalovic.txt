I swam through the snow
I swam the laps of innocence
The laps of an angel by my side
The sound of laughter by my side
The happiness swimming abreast of me
I rolled down the hills of light
I rolled unrolling the scrolls of innocence
The scrolls of all the white by my side
The hues of a multitude of smiles by my side
Joy cries joy screams abreast of me
It was so easy so easy to swim
So easy to swim the laps of innocence
The laps of an angel by my side
The sound of laughter by my side
The happiness swimming abreast of me
So easy to roll down the hills of light
To roll unrolling the scrolls of innocence
The scrolls of the white by my side
The hues of a multitude of smiles by my side
Joy cries joy screams abreast of me
The flickering whiteprints of a snowflake heart
The twinkling joy of my fast beating heart
The sparkling breath of my wind spinned heart
The shimmering light of my angel fed heart
The beat the beat of the snow spelled heart
So beautifully taken breath blown away
