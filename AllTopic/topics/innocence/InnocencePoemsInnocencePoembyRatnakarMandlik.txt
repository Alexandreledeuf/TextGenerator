When I bypass you passes a chill
Through out my body, o lassi little
What of your possessions that lure me
For you in longing I begin to swim.
You are not a beauty celestial I know
Till my honor for you I can throw
Just to have a glance at you oh virgin
What for it happens I can not imaginbe.
Perhaps I have found in you a dream
With you I see innocence in my dreams
To be associated with my future consort,
Who must too possess an innocent heart.
Dare I can not to speak with you
Fearing it may give me a clue
Or it may throw me in sea of pain
Unveiling before me your non innocence.
