In covert dim light
A nymphet came
To grace his sight
With her small frame
He caught her scent
And closed his eyes
Felt fleeting movements
Soar him high
And as they kissed
He felt the bliss
Of escalating passion
The night was young
And before long
They'll lock
In emptied satisfaction
With deep desire
He yearned to touch
Her captivating youth
Undressing her
He watched
His lovely prostitute
The streetlight glazed
His eyes went wild
Despaired to see her face,
He saw the death
Of Innocence...
For his date was just
..........A child.
Child prostitution is the most cruel of all crimes as it preys on
an innocent child who cannot defend himself.
