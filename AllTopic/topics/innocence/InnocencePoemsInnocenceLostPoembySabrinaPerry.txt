You always looked straight past me
why couldn't you see the truth
he's been doing this to me for years on end
taking away my youth.
Now my innocence is gone forever
and he's the one to blame
the only way I see I can get it back
is to get a rope and hang.
He's hurt me so badly
so many times, in so many ways
and even though it's in the past now
it's still hurting me these days
i'm proud to say i've survived this long
but it all must come to and end
my heart is just too broken to go on
and doing this will help it mend
i love the ones who loved me back
and this is all that's left to say,
i hope to see you all again
in the afterlife someday
