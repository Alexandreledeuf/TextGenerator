It seems like Light Years ago
That sweet innocence
Like a flower in the bud
Growing in new existance
Fresh and un-flawed
Beauty and angelic substance
In the Garden unmarred
Basking in the sun with no resistance
Where oh where did i go?
It all happened so fast
One day i was pure growing tall
The next-plucked way to fast
Put in a vase amongst other flowers
Of equal or very close age
Devoured by eyes of the lusty Gardners
My innocence turned into rage
A day passed-perhaps two
Time was really irrevelant to me
Every day was the same for us all
Fresh water-and slow death agony
I felt it come upon me
Like the goodness was draining me dry
Loosing all of my substance
Bending over i knew i would die
Ragged and wilted i fought
As the others alongside of me
But resistance proved to be no assistance
The day the innocence in me was set free
And into the trash we all landed
Despairing our very last breath
My petals no longer like velvet
But a dried mixture of long fought floral death!
