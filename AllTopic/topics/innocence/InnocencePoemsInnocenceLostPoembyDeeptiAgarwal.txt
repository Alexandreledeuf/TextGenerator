Innocent girl of seven
always looked at heaven,
hoping to get a glimpse
of her father long gone, since...
No where were colours
which made her pailer.
Living among a big family
found herself lonely.
was afraid of demons
did'nt knew will find one
at the place she called 'home'
could not escape
devil overpowerd her... taking away
her innocence,
making her life colourless.
Demon frightened her so much
she dare not open her mouth.
though her heart, and,
body wanted to shout.
Oh! what a fate she saw -
was forced to tie the sacred thread.
Her heart bled. She recoiled back
in her cocoon
no body saw
the tears,
the fears.
