I don't know when I was born,
Maybe when humanity didn't exist.
I was lost, in the senses of the insentient beings;
Always trying to find something.
Then came the humans, and I found my worth.
I found my place in the stone man's child
And the warmth of the fire made,
Since then I am multiplied.
I am the newborn's cry and the old man's last grin;
The blue of the ocean, red of the fire;
Half Bent bough of the golden tree to the ground,
Yellow no more, I am coloured brown
Once the air smelled of me, and the soil whispered my name;
I was serenity, I was beauty;
But for years I was harmed
And my luster has happened to dim.
And then came the bullets
With their sharp faces drilling my reality;
I felt lonely, for no one remembered me,
Puffed with the grey smoke far I went
Now I doubt myself, have I ever existed?
But when that sudden qualm would arise
I would find myself in the smile of a mother
With her child, I am still aliveâ€¦
