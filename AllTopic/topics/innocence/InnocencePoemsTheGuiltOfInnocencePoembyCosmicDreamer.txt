Sentenced to death for a crime I did not commit,
Execution at dawn... such a clich√©,
All of my last request's denied,
Morning arrives on the final day of my existance,
Paraded through the streets like some kind of prize,
The aroma of life so evident in my final hours,
Dragged up onto this hellish platform, dignity stripped,
These man made gallows offer such a view 0f life,
How ironic that life is  my final view when death comes to call,
Blindfold refused, rope placed around my neck,
Trembling uncontrolably... Goodbye cruel world,
Trap door opens and I fall, neck snapped like a twig,
Spiraling deeper and deeper into the darkness of the abyss,
May the maker have mercy upon my soul...
Spread the love... The peace will follow...
