The way I got involved
I could not make revolt
Their ill-intention
Crushed my ambition
With my utter innocence
I respected their arrogance
But I forgot
My destined lot
They played with my passion
It satisfied their emotion
They warned me in a strange voice
I avoided it coz it was my choice
Their behaviour made me realize
I was of no use-without price
They were happy to see me in trouble
I was fool I made my grief double
False love they showed to hide their hatred
I came to know this bitter truth then I regretted
My defeat lay in their victory
Their road depended on my journey
I thought it must be an ending
People say it is only a beginning
If it is only a start
Who will then try to thwart
I want to ask a question to them
Did they not feel any kind of shame?
If it is a beginning
It will never last for ending
They have started  this game
But I will finish the same.
