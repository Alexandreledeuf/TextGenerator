A mother's job is to shelter.
A mother's job is to care.
It's my pleasure to do these things for you,
and enjoy the life we share.
Problems may surround us
and try to keep us down.
But, I will never give up the faith
on the love that we have found.
Our family is precious.
To me, there is no end.
Not only are you my children,
You also are my friends.
I know you will be happy.
I know you'll set your mind
to go after the success in life
only a good person can find.
Don't let them tell you different.
Don't let them break your stride.
Don't let their hatred hurt you.
Remember...you have pride.
