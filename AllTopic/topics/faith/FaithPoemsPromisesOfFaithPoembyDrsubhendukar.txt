promises of faith as when the truth
flows like a fountain of beauty
beneath and beyond the trust
at the alter of love vile less and divine
looking to the moon
the blue sky above the home
to the glory of sweet voices ye tuning
in the depth of night yet blazing luminous
as swaying becomes brighter and bestirred
the trust of stunning rune by the muse
as when eclectic to the reason of acceptance
when persuading the truth pervading within
yet it flows to the edges of time as we embrace
melting the pain when resourced by blessing
the sorrows of being yet apart from the heart
as the deep scars from the hue of love idyllic
