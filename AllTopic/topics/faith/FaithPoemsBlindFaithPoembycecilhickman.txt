Within this eclipse of darkness, we overcome.
Our minds clouded in in a circumference of ideas.
Below us is the fiery temptation we all scantily avoid.
Our seas of life seem to be in a fury that we dispose.
Swirling waters around our souls waiting patiently,
Captivate dark colors that parade in the universe.
Invading us is the lava of love, the waves of ecstasy.
Rolling to the inner cells of our probable blind faith,
Though this eclipse seems to be endless in design,
Truly only moments of this, tribulation is its existence.
Tomorrow shall bring sunshine, peace, glory, to all.
Some say, blind faith, is without true understanding.
Faith and religious quests will break out blind faith.
