I had faith in his word
And it failed me
I had faith in my friends
They left me
I had faith in the mirror
It shattered on me
I had faith in justice
It hurt me
I had faith in the world
It laughed at me
I had faith in my family
They turned their back on me
But I'm not disappointed in them
More of myself
You see I had faith in my strength
It crumbled before me
I had faith in my mind
It stopped working on me
I had faith in me
I failed on myself
