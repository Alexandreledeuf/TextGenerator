Let your hope rest on the faith
he has placed in your heart.
Never give up never let go.
He can lead you by the still waters,
Quietly restoring your soul.
He speak words of wisdom,
The promise of glory.
Trust him you'll see He's got all
The power you need.
He never early, never late
It take courage and it takes faith.
He got all the power you need.
He saves forgives and heals,
He takes back what the devils steals.
Your debt's been paid in full
And everyday he does Miracles.
Got dreams turn them into plans,
too big for human hands.
Trust him you'll see, you got
all you need.
Real faith's a lot stronger than what you feel
He's real! I'm believing for Miracles.
