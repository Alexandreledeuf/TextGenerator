Yes, there is a stage
and yes, there are actors;
a script to engage;
an experienced director..
Yes, indeed, I’ll pray for you
to the One they say best deems
those matters which may bless our soul
however strange they seem;
Oh yes, I will pray for you,
as much as human can;
but, add this wish from me for you,
which is more personal:
In course of time – who knows how long? –
may you look back and say,
‘Although it seemed ungodly cruel,
it turned out well for me..’
Yes, there is a stage
and yes, there are actors;
a script to engage;
an experienced director.
