I am a woman of faith
To a one true God
Depending, leaning and relying
I run to You in prayer
Whenever my soul needs searching
I am a woman of courage
whenever i am down
I maybe tired, drained and worn out
But i know I am strong
To face the situation
I am a woman in love with the Lord
A woman of faith
who believes in His love
A woman of courage
Who turns my sadness to a joyful dance
I know, i can brave the storm
I know I'll never be alone
You bring out the best in me.
To love, to care and to reach out
A treasure that will never last..
