A man with faith can win the world with ease;
A war is won with faith in its soldiers;
A leader with faith brings about world’s peace;
A faithless man always has unknown fears.
Strong faith can heal an adamant disease;
Faith in oneself makes one self-confident;
Faith in religion and God gives mind’s peace;
Faith alters in our favor, an event.
Faith is needed to maintain good friendship;
You ought to have faith in a stranger too;
Faith in the captain brings to harbor ship;
Faith is needed even to win a coup!
Have faith in the man for earthly things done;
Have faith in God for Heavenly grace won.
