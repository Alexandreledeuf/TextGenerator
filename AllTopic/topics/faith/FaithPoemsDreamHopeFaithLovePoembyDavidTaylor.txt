i have a dream
or a dream dreams me
i have hope
a hope that is for me
i have faith
a faith that's not in me
i have love
a love for all i see.
I had a dream
a dream that dreamed me.
I had hope
a hope that hoped for me.
I had faith
a faith in I, in me.
I is love
a love which joins I
with all that i can see.
