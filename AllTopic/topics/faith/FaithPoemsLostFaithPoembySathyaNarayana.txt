Man lost faith in fellow men;
their thoughts, acts, words and virtues!
In a world of mutual mistrust
Scepters ruled the mighty kingdoms,
idols ruled human hope and wisdom;
statutes, rules and codes etch today
vows on papers!
Words of mouth go with the wind,
and prefer we walking on jotted lines.
Man against man is pitted
in a cobweb of scribble-jumble!
Alas, orals lost credence
and writings gained muscle!
Words or writings are of what vouch
when human ethics is in pathetic crouch? !
Was this the man; the Divine did plan?
What a shame to be called a human;
sans being humane, a quality God did sow
but alas, man never allowed it to grow!
