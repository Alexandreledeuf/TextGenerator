Standing at the water’s edge
He was shaken to the core
For the one he loved had died
He didn’t want to live any more
He was angry at God, you see
No longer felt God’s love
He asked a pressing question
To his Lord just up above
“Oh Lord I cannot take it
I have lost my faith in you
I feel I am abandoned and
I don’t know what to do
There is hurt inside my heart
A pain I’ve never known
My life has been uncertain
I am hurt down to the bone
You see, I finally found the one
Who made my life complete
And you took her Lord
You laid this pain at my feet”
And as the words he spoke
At the sunset water's edge
His heart took on a change
And to God he suddenly pledged
“I feel you in my heart now
You’ve never left my side
I’ll do the best I can, Lord
My faith has turned the tide”
So if you lose someone
And you feel this kind of pain
Hang on tightly to your faith
Let your love of God remain!
