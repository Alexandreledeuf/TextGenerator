A moment you wished you could remain in
That day you wanted to never stop
The time you professed your heart
When all was released
And you found inner peace
For some it comes but once in a life time
Through faith we may remain
Our hopes our dreams
All seeming possible
When at last we surrender
Finding what has been missing
The void that was never filled
Completeness and oneness
In Him, through Him and by Him
Creating a love that will never fade
The light that was brought inside
Shining for all to see
From His hand to mine
An eternal flame
That shall never be extinguished
