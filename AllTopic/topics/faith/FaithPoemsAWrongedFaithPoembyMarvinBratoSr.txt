Stricken by torrential tsunami
Life has become devastated
Hope broken, wasted, and died
Devoid of ember, turning to ash.
Existence is finite, it goes
Such destiny is inevitable
Caught as victim of pain
Hurt, beaten to pieces.
Sought God's providence
Often in time of turbulence
But when life is abundance
We ignore His presence.
We have no time for God
When life so pleasant
But we cry so much
Upon tribulation.
And blame on Him
All our sufferings
For forsaking us
In death.
