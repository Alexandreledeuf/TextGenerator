A simple case of lack of faith
When you should really have enthused..
And love me and trusted me
Because I am your muse
But you didn't, quite obviously
You chose to choose another's words
Well, then hell, what am I
Who am I to argue?
Nothing, but a wilting flower
And that stream that has no-where to go
Undulating, not crystal clear
Muddied with false hope.
