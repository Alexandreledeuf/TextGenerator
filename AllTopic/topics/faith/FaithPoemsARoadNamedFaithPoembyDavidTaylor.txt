Incandescent moonlit evening light
A walk along a distant road
That leads where no one has described
Some have been there and tell me so
But in going they cannot say
What they saw when they went that way.
Incandescent moonlit evening light
A walk that’s leaving bright lights of
All that’s known behind
And not knowing what will be found
Walking alone not in a crowd
Along a distant road as if in a shroud.
Incandescent moonlit evening light
I know not what is out of sight
They say that once this road is travelled right
With no more journeys will I be troubled
Freely marching as to death
But only death of all that has been left.
Incandescent moonlit evening light
Will I arrive this very night
Will I surrender all I own
Am I ready, can I atone
With all this universe and most of all
With all my actions since my first birth?
Incandescent moonlit evening light
They call me back
Thoughts binding tight
I walk on simply letting go
If I arrive
Who will ever know?
