The dust settles and past has been locked
Roads are empty where you once walked
The veiled songs of when you were young
Never seem to be back on your tongue.
Something’s changed, yet somehow it is the same
Stuck in a rut of time, yet the clocks’ hands tick away
Too afraid to let the past spill on the canvas of today? -
Just look up at the sky
And he will show you the way.
Images unpleasant, your conscience will decay
You’ve saved the hurt for a rainy day
Changing the photo on the photo frame
Your misplaced life you’re trying to reclaim.
The rain is lashing down hard, yet the sun is bright
The past re-plays before your eyes
The script is re-written and you’ve come clean
Metamorphosed routine-a role has been essayed
He has shown you the way.
