Faith on which one can live whole life
Faith on which one can keep hopes alive
Faith on which one can build confidence
Faith on which one can overcome encumbrance
Faith on which one can strengthen determination
Faith on which one can accomplish aspiration
Faith on which one can take dream to reality
Faith on which one can continue to live with ecstasy
Faith on which one can gain even after loosing
Faith on which one can refill the color in life by proving
Faith on which one can fight against injustice
Faith on which one can rest in paradise & peace
Faith in good faith becomes stronger & stronger
God will not be able to hold much longer & do wonder
