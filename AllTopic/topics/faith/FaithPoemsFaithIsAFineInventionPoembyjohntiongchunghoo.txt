faith is Nile's flood
setting ground  for grace
faith - it flies in and out
a mother bird divides feed
the blessed a bushel
the others little by little
the almighty plays a game of chess -
-  listens to spiritual  music -
- and hums his heavenly nursery rhyme
that calms terrified earthly souls -
faith is Nile's flood that springs silent cheers from heart to heart
inspired by
'Faith' is a fine invention
When Gentlemen can seeâ€”
But Microscopes are prudent
In an Emergency.
Emily Dickinson
