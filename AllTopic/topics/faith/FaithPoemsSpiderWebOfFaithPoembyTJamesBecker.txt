Like the first cracks in the ice of a pond
My heart began to break and fall apart
Desires and plans slipping through the cleft
Pieces falling into the cold water of sorrow
Any hope of becoming numb grows futile.
A frosted crystalline web began to form
Where love and contentment once lived
Harsh pain of loss depletes the body of warmth
Yet the heart beats unable to let love cool
Once a foundation is made of doubt and fear
Of mistrust and regret it is bound to collapse
Leaving behind a vacant heart once filled
Sorrow of such emotional magnitude
You feel it in the very depths of your being
Unable to see anything but darkness
Faith as thin as a spider web is all that is left
Yet you hold on the this thread for life
