The sky blue  how lovely to earth green tales by the grin
is it not gleams of hope by the urgency of dream
you showed me the light in the molten dark of cruised  passion
days I remember the rising sun diffuses over dew of dawn
warmth still stashed in its room of reason unknown
snow when stares into the room I may not share
age may not fall by its own wishes dehiscing the blue
reeks of shadow turn to pieces impaling the clouds by rain
clear sky ever opens its door of deliverance by transparency of truth
the desire when metamorphosed by the heavenly bliss
the path when scrupled by the blessing in desire as ahead
dregs of whispers promise a semblance of love unknown before
rose when holds on latching on to the dreams of new day even in storm
as the vivid flash of thunder yet livid over the green cornfield
earth still tautens its buoyancy of confidence breaking the shadow
yet hope of vision on shore braces up tempting the faith of tomorrow.
