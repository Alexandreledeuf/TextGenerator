I offer all I am or will ever be,
My prayers, deeds, the all of me
To serve and give to my Dear Lord,
Thru soul bound to Him by Silver-Cord
Some day He'll reach down a Loving Hand,
When Heaven calls, I'll leave this land
Rising up on snowy wings,
Go home at last, as Angels' sing
Songs of freedom, joy and mirth,
As I ascend to that special place,
Not far from Mother Earth
