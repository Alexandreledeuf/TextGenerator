your flairs and flares as yet gleaming
is never on the wane yet unfettered
flaming the fame of yours as protracting
is reasoned to the faith of love unearthly
the love of soul in embracing in desire
when benign words of love subtle true
whispers you at your askance cuddle you
as Hands of blessings blazing in disguise.
the blissful smiles on your grace undying
may lead you as high as you wink the sky
even reaching the moon and its blue
to rave up your beauty and glory yet unfazed.
