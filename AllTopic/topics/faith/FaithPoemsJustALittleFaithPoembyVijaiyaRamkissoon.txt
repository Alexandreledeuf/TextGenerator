Just a little faith can light your path
When everything seems dark,
Just a faith can push you forward
To achieve a higher mark..
Just a little faith can move a mountain
From its place
Just a little faith can assure you that
Life's challenges you CAN face..
Just a little faith can give you the courage
To reach your dream
Just a little faith can restore you confidence
and self esteem
Just a little faith can allow you to soar
Above the sky
Just a little faith can make you never give up,
and try, try and try, ,
Just a little faith can pull you up,
From rock bottom, straight to the top
Just a little faith can make a dying person
Once more alive
In a world which treats us as though we're nothing,
Just a little faith can make us SURVIVE........
Bless! !
