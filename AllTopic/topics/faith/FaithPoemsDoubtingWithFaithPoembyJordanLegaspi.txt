I cannot tell if God exist
But I believe God does
I cannot say God is this or that
But I feel Gods presence
I cannot prove what I believe
But I cannot disprove God
My religion taught me
About God who is a loving father
But some say God is like a mother
Few even claim I am a dreamer
For someone beyond truth and reality
Creation of reason for beauty
But what can I say
Deep in my heart God I see
Even if formless like nothingness
Yet day and night feel my senses
Too near yet so far I know it
But my friend to God I only trust
