I’m happy with whatev’r God does for me;
But others don’t agree to what I say;
I live in peace and total harmony;
My greed and earnings grow more day by day.
Show me O God a day when I’m secure;
My earthly wants increases endlessly;
Help me O God my suff’rings to endure;
I want to live a life more selflessly.
To keep soul pure is primary on earth;
The world may praise or chide me for my deeds;
God only cares for me ev’r since my birth;
I grow upright amidst the thorns and weeds!
God, be my light and drive all darkness out;
My faith in you should last without a doubt.
