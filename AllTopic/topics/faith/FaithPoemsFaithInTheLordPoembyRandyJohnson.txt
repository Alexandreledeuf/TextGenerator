A little boy needed an operation that his parents couldn't afford.
They didn't have much money but they had faith in the Lord.
The boy was terminally ill and he grew very frail.
But his parents never lost faith and he eventually got well.
Now he's in complete remission thanks to the Lord.
Their prayers and faith brought about this wonderful reward.
