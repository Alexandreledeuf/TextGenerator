When you want something bad,
And it canâ€™t be had
You feel sad
And at times mad.
At times there is no choice,
And to maintain your poise
You have to say yes to what is
And restore your mental peace.
You have to go down deep
And then take a giant leap,
To be aware of what is
There are times when you have to give life a miss.
Once the negativity is released,
You reclaim your natural ease.
Now is the only moment you can live
You finally come to believe.
Faith as small as a mustard seed
Is all you really need.
