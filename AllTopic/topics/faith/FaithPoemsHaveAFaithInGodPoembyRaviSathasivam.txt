Have a faith in God
then he will show you the way to live in serenity
Do not fear to knock at his door
because your faith will answer through him
Show your availability to him
then he will give you his ability
Give your heart and soul to him
then he will keep you away from all the sins
Make your life filled with faith
then he will fill your life with love and affections
Make God to give you strength when you are weak
then you will be free from all your pain
Have a long journey with God
then you will be learning the truth of heaven
Make God to belief your truth that held in your mind
then he will be rewarding you for your integrity
Remember, when you have a dark day then he
will be there for you with a candle to bright your soul
