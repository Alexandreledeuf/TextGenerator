What have I lost
I wonder...
And look inward.
Only my heart:
for it lies with you.
Only my soul:
for it's lost, in wilderness
abandoned by my searching self.
Only my voice:
the unspoken words
the unfelt plea
At a loss to articulate.
Lost.
Myself.
Why can't I even
find the words
to pray?
I'm thankful, though,
I still have You
Dear God,
Waiting for me...
