The stillness after the destructive storm.
The healing of a broken heart.
The birth of healthy baby.
The moving of leaves on a still warm day.
The chirping of birds after long night.
The calming words of a pastor after you sin.
The smile on your mother's face, when I walk in.
The 'you got mail' sign after a long quiet spell.
