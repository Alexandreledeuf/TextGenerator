Faith's no legs
So can not walk
Nor has any wings
So can not fly
Immature and tiny
Incubate in heart
Safe-guard to safe-guard
Rooted deep in allegiance
To break open light
In vision, listen, speech
In every disability
Of even on infernal-couch
For faith's now grown with wings
'Hope and confidence'
