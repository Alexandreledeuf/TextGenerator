FAITH OR FATE?
Melvin Banggollay
Faith or Fate or anybody else
can define one's life quest?
Faith, when we truly believed
That we can surely received
all the wants we conceived
With mercy of God we prayed.
Fate, when we truly believed
That we can surely receive
All that we want to perceive
if we're destined to receive
Fate, is a matter of destiny
To take its course or way
Faith, is a matter of an ability
sailing to complete the journey.
