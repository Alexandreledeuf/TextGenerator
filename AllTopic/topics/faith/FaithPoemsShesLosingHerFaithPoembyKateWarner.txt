She lies alone upon her bed
With a million thoughts
Running through her head
She blames herself for everything
Its all her fault, even though
She knows deep down inside
Beneath all the tears and the lies
That its not her fault
You cant imagine all the pain
She feels, and you cant imagine
All the days she fears
'please give me a chance'
I hear her pray, 'please let me
Have a better day, let me hold
My head up high, instead of hiding
Every day and night'
She gets up and looks in the mirror
Who is this girl
Staring back at her?
She doesn’t know who she is anymore
All that she wants is an open door
To lead her to the light
She doesn’t want to argue no more
And she doesn’t want to fight
She walks back to her bed of dreams
Its like she's on a tightrope
Ready to fall at any time
She looks up at the sky
Wishing that she could fly
Because anywhere is better than here
Better than all this fear
Then she looks over to her door as it opens
She's losing her faith…
