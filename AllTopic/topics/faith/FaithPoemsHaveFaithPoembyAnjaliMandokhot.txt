Have faith! But not to touch it
Not to hold it like I hold this pen-
Just have faith-
Even amidst the treason
Even amidst the doubt
Even in the face of that glaring question
'Does he really exists? '
Have Faith!
Have Faith! Thats the only answer
The end of every discussion over it
Just have faith-
It was never proved and established,
It will never be proved and established
It won't ever become a fact
That is why they say-
Have faith.
Have faith its not a dogma
Live it as a way of life not rituals
Just have faith-
Its a life long struggle to assert it
Its an unquenched thirst to believe in it
Its an unending search of a bodyless soul
Will always remain unsatisfied so-
Have faith!
Have faith but don't renounce for it
Instead endeavor to achieve and-
Just have faith-
That the endeavors will be successful
That they will breed more dreams to chase
That achieving is also a faith
But does not require conquering
Have faith!
Have Faith but not to fight atheism
That again is another face of faith
Just have faith-
To believe that the Ideal exists
To follow the Ideal, not to preach
To emulate the Ideal to the nearest possible
That is the purpose of all faiths
So have faith!
