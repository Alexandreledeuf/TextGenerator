We are dreamy creature
Long for the things which is unsure
Why does then human being dream?
When they can't think of forming even a team
Each time we dream and remain quiet
Allow the spring to pass off and autumn to let
No one has changed their style except man
We are no exception but remain unchanged as human
Dreams are always beautiful
Sometimes provide key to be successful
We laugh it out and take no note
Meanwhile the water may seep in and sink the boat
Dreams need nice push
Credible effort without any rush
It may definitely pay in long run
As nothing is impossible under the Sun
Not all the kids survive after birth
Not all the pots come out safe even if nicely berthed
So think of some success after great struggle
It is yardstick for every thing to succeed little
It is always nice to think high
Couple it with dreamy planning slight
It may come off the ground well
Success story may thereafter definitely tell
