Oh my defeat!  Long live!
You are my faithful wife-and
No one would come
For your relationship,
Oh my defeat! You are my mirror,
You helped me to see my image,
O my defeat! You are eternal sculptor,
You are an evolution of man,
O my defeat! You are a melting plant,
You are giving weapons to combat my life
Oh my defeat! You are an affable heat,            (Pleasant, friendly)
You are shaping my character to glorify,
Oh my defeat! You are a sharpening stone,
You are making me clever in life,
Oh my defeat! You are my brilliant school,
You taught me to convert the cyclone as my boat,
Oh my defeat! You are my philosopher and guide,
You are refining my ego,
Oh my defeat! You are not my wounds,
But my eyes,
Oh my defeat! Your flame tuned me to the
Level of beautiful flute,
Oh my defeat! You are not creating any loss,
But you are involving me to attain experiences,
Success brings addiction to oneself,
And we lose ourselves,
O my defeat! You are my remunerations,
I can buy the success with that money.
