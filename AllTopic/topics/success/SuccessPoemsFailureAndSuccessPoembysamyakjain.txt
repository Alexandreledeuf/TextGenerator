success is a damsel
that intoxicates;
failure is your mistress
that teases.
success is a drink
that leads to stupor;
failure is the beverage
that shakes you up.
success is a temporary
shed in life's journey;
failure is the pathway
to ultimate destination.
dont let thus
success beguile
into
momentary comfort;
learn to befriend failure
to last the journey's end.
success is the mistress
of easy charms;
failure is your wife,
of considerable virtues;
failure enriches you,
success may shower
riches on you;
failure is the sweet little
drummer to roses ahead
on the path ways,
success a sweet companion
not to be seen
when winter comes
your ways, as it must
in one's life,
leaving the summer
far, far behind.
