Failure is the penalty,
for continually getting things wrong.
Success on the other hand is the award,
for getting things continually right.
Failure puts you down in despair.
Success sends you soaring among the clouds.
Therefore, I look at myself and wonder,
am I a success or failure.
Then maybe I am a bit of both.
Whichever way the hammer falls
only you can decide.
