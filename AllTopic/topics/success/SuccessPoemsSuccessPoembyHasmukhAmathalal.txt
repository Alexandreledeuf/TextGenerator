Success lies beneath the popular support
If you maintain contacts and good rapport
It will be great encouragement and strength
If maintained on same wavelength
What amounts to failure or success?
When you fail to have full access
Relentless efforts with continuous zeal
It will mark a” finish” with final seal
It makes very great difference?
If you fail to draw correct inference
You must heed and pay to an expert advice
When something fails as mechanical device
United we stand and divided we fall
If you not wake up and not heed to call
You can swim against rising waves
With resolute action ways may pave
People will be frustrated and annoyed
If message is not be properly conveyed
Close your hand and it will form strength
People will follow it with same good length
Young may have to sacrifice and die
Not to give way and not simply lie
It is need of an hour and must rise to occasion
Not to wait for chance or battle for succession
More you work in peace time than less you may bleed
Success may touch your feet and you may succeed
Why not take chance and work for peace?
Life may be normal and you may leave at  ease
