My first step to success.....
it all began when it started
i held the page upright as it was free from ink
ideas flowed like a river in summer
my mind became glimmering with thoughts
i had to begin somewhere with the right
words, i had to tickle the reader at first sight
i sat as i drowned in knowledge
scanning the words carefully since i could not afford
mistakes
my fingers took the first step
my mouth entertained the words
my brain structured the llines
the pen moved along the page
half way towards the end
the alarm awakend me
mum shouting at her best
birds tweeting outside
i rose from my bed in disappointment
it was all just a dream.......!
