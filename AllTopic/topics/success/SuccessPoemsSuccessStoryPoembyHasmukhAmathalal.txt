Does success blind the man completely?
Not wait and go for its show immediately?
If he is earthly man then will slowly digest,
Means and ways set first and then suggest,
Only clever and seasoned will be enjoying,
All of sudden success may lead to annoying,
Way of living may bring tremendous change,
Confidence enhanced and disorderly manage,
Somebody may diversify to honouable living,
Purchase of luxurious cars and self driving, ,
Honest may prefer and turn to charity reviving,
Rest may go for sight seeing and sea diving,
It brings dramatic change in way of thinking,
Sudden urge and change some time lead to sinking,
Arrogance and power blind a person,
As sudden change you may find with season,
You look towards fellow brothers as inferior creature,
Their hello and address bite you as vulture,
You feel their company danger for future,
Ill feeling and distrust in mind nurture,
This all takes away from main stream,
Success story makes you to believe as dream,
You feel as if you had God given chance,
Forget the past and visit the club for dance,
Drink, drug and smacks are natural ally,
Money in hand doesnâ€™t look silly,
Pushed to the dark as time go on,
No way to come back, not even soon,
It will be nightmare or bad dream,
Success may blind but not allow to scream,
You will be completely cut off from friends,
Down to earth when success story ends
Success has another story to tell,
People have learnt how to remain well,
Act as humble and good ideas sell,
Where does then bad or descend the hell
