The secret of my success
is that Iâ€™m as crazy as a coot.
I am so full of silliness
my wife often denies she is with me.
When I get dressed for parties
and someone is giving me a lift
they shove me in the backseat
telling me to duck down
as far as I can get
as they do not want to be seen
with a crazy man in their car.
My answer to all this,
is that we need a few crazy people
who are just like me,
to bring a smile around,
stop everyone getting bored.
My motto is quite simple
a smile a day
keeps the miseries at bay;
a laugh is a dropp of sunshine
to those who wear a frown.
Maybe I should have a craziness day
so everyone can join in
and have as our trademark
a big lop-sided GRIN.
