Nothing permanent ever came
Neither success, nor failure.
It's how wise you play the game,
Your integrity that'll endure.
Eagles do look good in sky,
But whose voice is pleasing, say?
Which is the bird you want in nest
To sing for you all day?
He who plays fair always
Is the one ideal, worthwhile.
And even when he fails,
He accepts it with smile!
A man of succes is not he
Who has conquered all feats,
But he who the world envies
Even in his greatest defeats!
