Many things man wants to do in his life,
By roads easy and free himself from strife;
And many times he fails by foolish plans,
And designs, he ambitions tallness sans.
Failures are due to poor strategy oft,
And determinations that become soft;
Choosing the right field is quite important;
Come success to those who work incessant.
Weigh then the pros and cons of doing things,
And estimate the profit/ stress, life brings;
Check out if body’s fit for hardest work;
In case you fail, then never go berserk.
Faith, hope and hard work are most crucial things,
And this is true too of Poesy’s Wings.
