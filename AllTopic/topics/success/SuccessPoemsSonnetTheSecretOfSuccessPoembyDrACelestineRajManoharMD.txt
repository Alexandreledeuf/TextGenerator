Oh, shed your inhibitions; do something!
However long, one’s span of life is short;
Our little problems should not despair bring,
Nor steal the liveliness of our dear heart.
So, think aright; solutions surely come;
‘Never give up, ’- is the great man’s secret!
Great things are done by the blind, deaf and dumb;
Don’t be lazy; waste not time, fume or fret.
The biggest tree was born a sapling first;
All mammoth tasks can be broken to bits;
To do a thing that’s great, labor we must;
Sustained effort is important, not fits.
And start, we must from scratch some day, some way;
Earlier the better, you should not delay!
