The Road to Success
We all want to walk on the road of success
But do you day by day measure your progress
Do you have a vision?
Do you have a mission?
You need one even if it is inspired by television
We all want to walk on the road of success
But do you day by day measure your progress
Critically look at your personal development
Grizzle over the final accomplishment
Decide on the instruments you need at the moment?
On its road, there are many paths to take
With many sacrifices along the way to make
Patience, faith and hard work, please donâ€™t forsake
Or your dreams will pour empty into a wide lake
We all want to walk on the road of success
But do you day by day measure your progress
Is your vision greater than greatness?
You are the first one you must try to impress
Take a step at a time and do not digress
For success when achieved, I say without sarcasm
Is more gratifying than any orgasm
