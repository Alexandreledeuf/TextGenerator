Each and every one has got success story
You will be excited with news and others may feel sorry
Some one has to take the credit for it and enjoy
There may other factors too leading for the joy
It is culmination of hard efforts that makes it possible
It would have remained in dream and nearly impossible
Had there been no initiative of any sort in this regard?
It would have never been materialized even if worked very hard
It involves application of mind with strong resolve
No room is left and made sure that everybody is involved
It has to be joint effort with sincerity and dedication
It is first step toward success and is apparent indication
Success lies beneath the popular support
if you maintain contacts with good rapport
it will be great encouragement and contributing to strength
if maintained on same level with good wavelength
what amounts to failure or leading to success?
When you gain entry  to have full access
You go with relentless efforts coupled with zeal
it ends in good finish with final seal
it makes impact with great difference
If you fail to draw correct inference
You must heed and pay attention to an expert advice
When something goes wrong or fails as device
Things move on  with saying “United we stand and divided we fall”
If you do not wake up and respond to a call
You can swim against opposing current and rising waves
With resolute action and waves might pave
People will be frustrated with your success and annoyed
If message is not understood by them and properly conveyed
Close your hand and it strong with grip strength
People will understand clearly at good length
Youngsters may have to sacrifice and die
Not to give any way or simply tell lies
It is need of an hour and they must rise to the occasion
Not to take any chance or wait for  battle of succession
More you work in peace than less you may bleed
Success may touch your feet and you may succeed
Why not ride on high waves and shout for peace?
Life may not be normal and you may feel at ease
It is in fact two sides of the coin
One may be entering and other may be going
There may not be any joy if one them is missing
People may laugh at you and start teasing
