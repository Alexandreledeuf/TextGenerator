The road to success is not straight.
There is a curve called FAILURE,
A loop called CONFUSION,
Speed bumps called FRIENDS,
Red lights called ENEMIES,
Caution lights called FAMILY,
You will have flats called JOBS.
BUT
You do have a spare called DETERMINATION,
An engine called PERSEVERANCE,
Your insurance is called FAITH,
Your driver is GOD!
You will make it to the called SUCCESS, but
There will be one more trip to make.
And when that one is done,
Guess who will be there to welcome you?
And state to you' JOB WELL DONE'
May GRACE be with you and PEACE be upon you.
