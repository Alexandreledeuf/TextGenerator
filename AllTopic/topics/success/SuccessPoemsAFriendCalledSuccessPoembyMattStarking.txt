Success is a friend to
Those who persevere
He is free and very fair
He speaks but they don't hear
So failure puts them to fear
They can't find success
But he lives near
The street of determination
Seek him in your imagination
And you will find him in your vision
You can't achieve success with force
But perseverance and endurance
For he keep changing his location
Through innovation
