Someone once called me a failure
for the publications that I lacked,
but I think they were wrong,
Success is not how much money
or gold that you earn.
Success is how many friends
in your life can hold,
for they are more precious
than money or gold.
Friendship has no price tag,
it cannot be bought or sold
and it comes from a heart of gold.
Therefore, in the future
any friends you may acquire
treat them with respect
unless you wish
their friendship to expire.
