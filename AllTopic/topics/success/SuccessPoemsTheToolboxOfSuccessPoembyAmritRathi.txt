Today we will open the Toolbox of Success
and examine each tool,
so as to succeed in everything
using it to the very full.
Ok. You're getting angry, but can you wait?
Or switch off this TV, to study even if it’s late?
Or forego the burger to save your health?
Or try to be humble in spite of your wealth?
You need the patience
to forego something minor now,
to achieve something major in the future:
this is the essence.
So patience is the most powerful tool
to fool around
for success in everything;
it lays the ground.
It is a bit difficult, though a rewarding journey:
from instant pleasure to efforts for the future,
from temptation of now to wait and nurture,
and you're in control all around.
Again—are you grumbling or blaming others?
Or do you take full responsibility for your affairs?
Either you won't see what’s that bothers
or you’ll be able to decide and take all the cares.
So assuming responsibility’s another powerful tool
to fool around
for success in everything;
it lays the ground.
It is a bit difficult, though a rewarding journey:
from shifting blame to accepting your faults,
from defense mechanism to confidence-vault,
and you're in control all around.
Again—are you constantly updated with realty?
And use new ideas to fuel your imagination?
Either you're open with all options, possibilities,
or stuck in the old rut with knee-jerk reaction.
Determining what applies to a situation is a powerful tool
to fool around
for success in everything;
it lays the ground.
It is a bit difficult, though a rewarding journey:
from the rigid outlook to a flexible approach,
from sheer stagnation to change is brought,
and you're in control all around.
When and how much of these techniques but to use:
to enjoy the beauty of a flower should you choose?
or when and how much even anger can be shown?
or take responsibility that's not yours even to muse?
or how much the new from the old is to be drawn?
This is called balancing, another powerful tool
to fool around
for success in everything;
it lays the ground.
It is a bit difficult, though a rewarding journey:
from strictly applying tools to modifying for need,
knowing how much discipline, the discipline needs?
And you're in control all around.
Finally, what is the toolbox of success that holds
all these tools, creating an urge in you so bold?
Love—that's what contains them all into its fold:
for his brighter future, a mother makes her son—
though it pains her—study hard and to slog on.
So from the Toolbox of Success, the love,
pick up these powerful tools
to fool around
for success in everything;
it lays the ground.
