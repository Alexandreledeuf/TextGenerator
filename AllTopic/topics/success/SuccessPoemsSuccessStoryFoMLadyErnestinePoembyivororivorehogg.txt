She was as timid as a mouse.
Kept firmly under mothers thumb
she very rarely left the house.
Her mother taught her she was dumb.
But mother died and she was free
to do the things she wanted to.
None to frown disapprovingly
and tell what her she had to do.
An innocent of twenty three
Although she lacked self confidence.
She was still wise enough to be
well guided by her common sense.
She knew that she must take it slow.
There was so much she had to learn,
so many things she did not know.
Each hurdle she would take in turn.
She was resolved to seek advice
but was not sure where she would find
Although she could afford the price,
Advice that was both wise and kind.
Her mother’s sister Aunty Jean
was who she took her troubles to
A lady who had always been
disapproved of by mother too.
So Aunty Jean took her in hand
and showed her how she ought to dress.,
Wise enough to understand
that her young niece felt helpless.
A lifetime under Mothers thumb
had left its mark indelibly,
A problem she must overcome
before she was completely free.
to be the woman she should be
They worked together as a team
moving forward very slowly
But in due course fulfilled her dream.
Now with her new found confidence.
She was a woman self possessed,
well made up and smartly dressed.
Her mother’s ghost now laid to rest.
Freed from her mothers influence.
No longer dowdy and afraid.
Epitome of elegance
She was a model highly paid.
Though mother would have disapproved
well armoured in her prudishness
that she was wrong her daughter proved
By her own efforts a success.
Mothers do not always know best
Although they always think they do
I think this mother failed the test
She knew less than she thought she knew.
