Success
What is success?
Is it a good job?
Is it a lot of money?
Is it a high ranking social status?
Is it a happy family?
Is it good looks?
Is it popularity?
Or perhaps is it even a ticket to heaven?
Or hell?
What about eternal life one earth?
Today in society's commen sense and point of view
Money, Power, Fame
That is success
They stamp it into your head and create the thought
SUCCESS
Yes a wonderful yet mysterious word
As for me
That is not success to me
Success is HAPPINNESS
That is success to me
Yes
