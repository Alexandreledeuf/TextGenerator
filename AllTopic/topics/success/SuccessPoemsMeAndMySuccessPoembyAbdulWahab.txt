My first love
And my first success
To win over her
When I compare
I feel
I am more in love
With my success
Than my first love
Though her lips were
More red than coral
More erect her breast
Than the cliff Everest
Yet I get more taste
In the soft touch
More delight in the eyes
Of my success
When we walk
Hand in hand
Side by side
People see and awe
Our dazzling beauty
Spread all over
As I know
Success makes a man more handsome
So I see a bevy in queue
Posing as lover
But my success
I love her more
When she speaks
Oh, I am out of things to compare
Me and my success
Least I can say
I notice  people
To sigh and  wonder!
