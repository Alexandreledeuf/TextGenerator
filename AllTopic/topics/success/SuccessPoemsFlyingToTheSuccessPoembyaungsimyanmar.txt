To fly to the success
How many wings should we have?
The wind, a great fortune.
No...
The wind, trying hard.
Not yet...
The wind, being wise.
Not right...
The wind, the desire that is strong.
Totally wrong...
So we need all of these.
Not complete...
--***---***----
The only wind we need is
Being ready for every case.
Hence, my message is that
Getting ready for everything is
Flying to the real success.
