Such irresistible twins,
Shadowing  each other,
One can't make it,
Others can't do it.
Holding hands together,
Far and wide to the ocean,
seas, rives and waterfalls,
to the greatest heights,
and profound deep,
both of them following the other.
Failure first then comes success,
Success first then comes failure,
Both of them give way to the other,
For they know so well,
either one can live freely,
For they are both
Shadows and Twins!
