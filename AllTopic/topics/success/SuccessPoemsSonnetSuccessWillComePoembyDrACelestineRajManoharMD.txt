Don't lose your heart if failures come with ease;
Build up courage and try again-succeed;
Let failures not disturb your mental peace;
Delayed if mirth is sure to well exceed.
Rewards may come to some in ways unknown;
Rewards may miss the truly talented;
Rewards may make a person sometimes clown;
All flowers aren't born to be well-scented.
Though failures come, our duty we must do;
Let Nature take its time and course it must;
Results could be very untoward too;
Our human eyes cannot avoid road-dust.
The patient man will soon succeed in life;
But one knows not, how long can last one's strife.
