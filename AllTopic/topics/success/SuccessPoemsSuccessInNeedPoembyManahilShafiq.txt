success is something
which u  keep chasing
until u trap it in net
and lock it up
and look day and night
that the prisoner wont escape
and be caught somewhere else
by people who wont set it free
just like u planned to keep
and once it escapes
it leads to fighting and pain
and even break between success seeking friends
some think why is it important
to fight for such a thing
to strive without a friend
to waste time searching
but only few know the advantage of its presence.............................
