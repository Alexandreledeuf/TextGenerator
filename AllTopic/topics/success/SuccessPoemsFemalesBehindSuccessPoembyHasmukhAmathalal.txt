I dare not violate the woman’s modesty
It will be pure injustice and no honesty
The clouds may look dark and atmosphere little misty
But all this can be termed as impure and dirty
They have come into being of their own
God has given them delicate figure to maintain
If they look good and beautiful not their fault
Almighty has placed caring heart too and kept as inbuilt
How do we roam freely with joy in garden?
The flowers of all colors have emerged all of sudden
It is their presence to be felt in nice environment
Do they not deserve nice eyes to look at with comments?
I am fascinated with the way they open up and boom
They may not look that beautiful when decorated in room
They may add beauty and nicely adore
But we need to do something more
We appreciate feminist out look and touch
We do take care and appreciate very much
I love being very near to them and present
All that I could do without any reservation and not resent
I feel we have great and caring heart like female
In some of the fields they have outwitted males
Females have proved great artists and poets
Remain in doors still all fronts keeping very quiet
So much to learn from their feminist look and nature
They are great philosopher even if not fully matured
The motherly and caring nature all that very much assure
At least I feel honestly secured of near future
We may have different character inbuilt
We may show favor and make some tilt
Still they outsmart us in every field and make move
They have made their presence known and need not prove
Time and again it is male very clear
I hear it number of times and pleases ears
All stories about them have vanished like yesteryears
They are dear alright but so much to be afraid of or fear
They are submissive but not to the extent beyond limit
They have dedication and will power to show and exhibit
We can not be unsecured or unsafe in their orbit
It will be too naïve to disregard or praise little bit
We are soft and fragile on women
Even though we are wild animal but appear as strong man
Not all the men derive their strength from women partners
Still they remain as driving force to be reckoned with care
