Essence holds its dream entire,
Strengthens hope true into fire
To fit in it to be higher
To the most breezed to aspire.
Its strength with a wind-lot by,
Sprouts ambition to the sky
To bloom into a smile high.
Happiness across to fly,
Its fluttering wings in flight
Spreads across the field its light.
Blossomed is success glass-bright
With glory mounting in sight.
Heart content is in sublime,
Remains diamond-worth in prime.
Victory does reign in clime,
Hailing joy bell-like to chime.
