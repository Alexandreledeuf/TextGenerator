I dream the future without the past
Of when my success will be a blast
Intent of heart, I see the best
Hope for the future, with God I rest.
I crave for success, I hope for hope
God start the process, I crave to cope.
I see a flash, a flash of hope
I'm up the mountain, nomore the slope
Lord take me higher, Lord take me up
Mobilize the process, and do not stop.
I crave for success, I hope for hope
God start the process, I crave to cope.
Night and day, I hope in silence
The possibility of a future so dense
If I persevere, and continue hoping
Then my future will cease from joking.
I crave for success, I hope for hope
God start the process, I crave to cope.
