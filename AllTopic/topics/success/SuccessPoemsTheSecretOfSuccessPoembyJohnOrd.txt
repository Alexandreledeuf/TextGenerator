When young I often thought success,
Meant wealth and power I must stress,
An easy life, with all lifes pleasures,
A mansion high, with worldly treasures,
Tours abroad to places new,
While in some bank my money grew,
Some people yes, tis aim they try,
Yet still a dream for you and I .
Late in life I thought again,
Together still through joys and pain,
Yes, we are wed through all those years
Sharing troubled times and tears,
Our money spent on all our plans,
Yet still so happy, holding hands,
Our children grown, as we grew old,
Your love for me worth more than gold
This love we share, I now caress,
I feel the secret of success.
