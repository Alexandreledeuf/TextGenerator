Failures infinite in life
Despair-- Demoralisation--- Depression-
Hence success by mere thoughts
At least momentary happiness-- bliss--- ecstasy--
To reap the joy of the implausible
The unattained fulfilment of the feat
Which proved to be defeat
Thus success in failure.
Note: With umpteen failures in life where there's no success at all a bit of momentary happiness can be gained by thinking of it.
