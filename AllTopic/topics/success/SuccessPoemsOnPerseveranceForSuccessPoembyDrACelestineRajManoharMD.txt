Who says that things cannot be done?
Nothing’s impossible on earth;
Most things are possible under the sun;
But perseverance should be thine friend!
The one who gives up with ease is a fool!
The wise person labors with determination;
Yet, one must choose the things that one can do,
And go full steam ahead, till comes success.
Perseverance is the secret of success;
By continual toil, failures can be avoided;
Great things were done by burning mid-night’s oil!
“The toiler harvests best of fruits in life.”
