O holy success, my darling success,
Weather indigo or starry, it'll glow,
As fountain vessel of blood
In my sweet faithful heart.
It shall sprung, from East South or
North West I don't have the idea
From Core Cardinal or spinning of axis
But my willing success i foresaw,
As inevitable as Death, my success' veritable,
Irreplaceable, irresistible, unstopably unchangeable,
O my destiny, I an a glorious child
No matter how far the Sky, I'll win
No matter how scary king Pharaoh, I'll rule,
My skin black, my brain pure, my glory shines,
Thou Suns smile, the star applause to the moon
I'm a king, nonnegotiable's my success,
Welcome abode, my success.
