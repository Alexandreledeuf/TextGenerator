How does a person determine his or her worth
You may ask what is your purpose on this earth
When you look for the answer... who do you ask
Who is appropriately delegated to take on the task
What scale of degrees will measure your qualities
Will you fill a predetermined mold and aim to please
Become self-sufficient while taking care of your needs
It is important to balance the budget with your proceeds
Become educated and develop skills with knowledge
Train to be someone who makes a sincere pledge
Fulfillment will tell you when you have finally arrived
Be content and satisfied... don’t let yourself be contrived
Reserve a portion of time for your family and friends
The caring attention you give has rewarding dividends
In the end, will you be able to say with a straight face…
I didn’t just take up space... I made the world a better place
