Just like how ocean’s waves all fall and rise,
Again, again incessantly, forev’r!
When failures come, remain we must most wise,
And try again, again but quit never.
The greatest men had failures too, much more;
Yet undeterred, they fought their way through them;
Recurrent failures could open new door;
Perseverance must be success emblem.
Learn from each failure but never look back;
Let world comment and mock, ’tis not for long;
But never do become lethargic/ slack;
No one predicts when rings your success gong!
Great men were dull once but never gave up;
Always in life, like a steed you gallop.
