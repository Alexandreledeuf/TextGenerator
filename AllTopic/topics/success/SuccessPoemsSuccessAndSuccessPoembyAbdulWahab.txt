Every ripple does not make a wave
Each wave does not reach the shore
Yet they are made and kept sending
The reason we are taught
Life is like an ocean
And our endeavours are like ripples
We should keep making them
Few of them will create a poem like waves
And sometimes make you float up on the shore of success.
