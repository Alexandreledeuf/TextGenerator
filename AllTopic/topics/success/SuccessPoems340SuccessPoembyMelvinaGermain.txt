Success is having what it takes
to keep positivity on the trail
to total freedom.
Stand firm,
knock negativity to the ground,
forgetting it  ever came around.
Holding yourself accountable
for everything you do.
Offering a helping hand to those not as
fortunate as you.
Giving when finances are high,
giving when
finances are low,
acknowledging you reap
what you sow.
