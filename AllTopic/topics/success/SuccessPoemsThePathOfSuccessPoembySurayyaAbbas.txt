Bitterness in life
Cannot be avoided
Without emotional involvement.
Though, we try
To make aur decesions
Without the fear
Of failure.
But to earn
The real success in life
And get stronger and stronger
With the passage of time,
We have to be dependent on the
Will of God
For God has set
A path for us
To follow and excel.
