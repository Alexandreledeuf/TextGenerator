O Lord! don't give me success,
If it takes away my freedom;
Don't give me success,
If it pulls me in the ditch of pride;
O Lord! don't give me success,
If it makes me alone;
If it takes away my friends,
If it makes me deaf to hear the forest;
O Lord! don't give me such a success,
If it takes me away from thy beauty;
Don't give me success, O Lord!
If it takes me away from You!
