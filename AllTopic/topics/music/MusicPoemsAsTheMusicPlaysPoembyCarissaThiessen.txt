As the music plays
my heart aches
it aches with pain
pain of the past
and pain of the present
As the music plays
my heart aches
it aches with hurt
hurt that I have caused
and hurt that has been caused
As the music plays
my heart aches
it aches with passion
passion that yearns
and passion that wants
As the music plays
my heart aches
it aches with love
love that will never be shared
and love that will never be known
As the music stops
my heart no longer aches
it doesn't feel anything
the music has stopped
and so has everything else.
