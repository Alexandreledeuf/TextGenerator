You sing
I will be the mountain and hold your voice deep inside
You feel
I will be the earth and keep your vibrations in my core
You cry
I will be the ocean keeping your sacred drops alive
You chant
I will be the holy hymn, we shall soar
You fly
I will be the sky, always holding you high
You dance
I will be the music that you wore
