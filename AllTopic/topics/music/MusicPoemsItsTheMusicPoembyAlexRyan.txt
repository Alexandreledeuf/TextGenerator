Do you hear it
Its the pounding of your heart
The thump of your foot hitting the pavement
Its the rythym
Its the song in your head
That tune your whistling
The jingle on the TV
Its the music
Its the rap kicking with the subs
The rock that show you how to stick it to the man
The blues with that soul
Its the music
What is it
Its the music
The heartbeat of the world
The rythym that brings us together
The only universally understood language
Its the happiness
The sorrow,
The guidance,
The inspiration
Its the music
It lives in us all
Its the music
The power
The life
