How beautiful the sounds
Of music in your ears;
It makes you dance, & sing, & hear
All the grandeur of the years.  Just listen to that Tuba
And Violin strings so sweet;
It brings memories to many
Who recall dancing in the street!  So climb upon the bandwagon
Of memories young & old;
It may help all music lovers
To put sweet music in life's mold!  Sweet music, oh sweet music
How grand the tunes all sound,
Just listen to those different songs
And know they're all profound!
