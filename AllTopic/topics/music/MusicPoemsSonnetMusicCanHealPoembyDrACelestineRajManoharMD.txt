But Music cures in ways akin to drugs;
Enchanting mind, delighting the hearer;
And lulls a child to sleep as mother hugs,
Rejuvenates the wearied work better.
And calms the nerves and soothens broken heart,
Evoking emotions of any type;
Music has destressing effect in part;
But hymns create a ho1iness and hype.
And Music heals the body parts as such,
Removing pain, relaxing muscles well;
Its rhythm helps the breathing pattern much,
Its magic holds man, beasts, plants under spell!
Yet, Music has lesser side-effects used;
And keeps the patient, Doctor both amused.
