Music isn't just music, it's a way of life.
Music is more than life.
It's a work of art.
Music is like a cumulous cloud on a stormy day. It brings joy to the people who love it.
Music is like a catelpillar hatching out of its chrysalis its spreds its wings at a slow part dramactic part then takes flight in the entergetic parts.
Music is more than life.
It's an inspiration.
