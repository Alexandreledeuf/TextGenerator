I can feel the music, it reaches out to me,
freeing itself from measured lines;
sometimes it vibrates in -depth chords,
with a mysterious pulse of its time.
Music, music, there should always be music,
without it life has no rhythm for design;
it whistles on the wind, it waits to come in,
and it beats with your heart and with mine.
