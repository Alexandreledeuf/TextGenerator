My heart starts to beat like  drum
My mind sings music of love
And words overflows from my lips
Music flows in my viens
And It reaches every part of me
Love spreads and heart rejoices
It  heals my body and my mind
Upbeat music reaches my brain
It lift up  my mood boost my body
And nature hums along with me
It's the time to  tap my toes
Dance in  rhythm with my love.
