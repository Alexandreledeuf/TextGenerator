Play life's music sweetly, play life's music low
As demons once awaken come, in fast and low
Play life's music gently, let sleeping dragons lie
Play life's music slowly, be gentle on yourself
Life's music can be restful, life's music can be nice
Listen with an open heart and let sleeping monsters lie
