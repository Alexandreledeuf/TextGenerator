Orphus 'twas playing
His most magical tune
While Greek soldiers
Fought under blue moon
Tyrants and despots
Bent towards their evil whims
Undaunting acrimony
Their foul mouths spin
But in the distance
Near the Aegean Sea
Orpheus's music
Has inticed little me
The Oracle announced him
'He's magic' The oracle bemused
Poetry came to me
I so very enthused
The Acropolis of Athen's
Stood tall at attention
In hopes that Orpheus
Would give them honrable  mention
Dedicated to: Origins of Poetry
To Orpheus and all things Greek
I love You...
