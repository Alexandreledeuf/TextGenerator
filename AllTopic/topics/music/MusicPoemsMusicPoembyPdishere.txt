Music touches you the most,
It refreshes you with its serenity.
Be it Do, Re, Me or Sa, Re, Ga, Ma,
Music is the soul of life.
Nothing is as divine as music.
It comes from within
And expresses joys and sorrows
Which reside in the heart.
World is full of music,
Each unique and sweet.
Whether chirping of birds, rustling of wind,
Roar of waves or the music of dolphins.
If music is not a part of life,
It would become a walk on knife.
So listen to music always,
And live some cheerful days.
