My brother
My brother is my keeper
My brother is my best friend
My brother is my pain
My brother is my hero
To take life
To have life
My brother did both
He is the source of all evil
The good in every evil
He lay down at let life fly
When he arise he wants to die
To take life to a new heights
My brother is my keeper
My brother is my best friend
My brother is my pain
My brother is my hero
He does things that hurt me so bad
That I wish he would die
He punishes me for the simplest thing
Thatâ€™s when I turn mean
He tells on me to mother
When I do nothing at all
My brother is my keeper
My brother is my best friend
My brother is my pain
My brother is my hero
He is my best friend
My friend that would do anything for me
From taking a life
To giving CPR
Stand next to me from thick and thin
Until the end of our time
My brother is my keeper
My brother is my best friend
My brother is my pain
My brother is my hero
He is my keeper
My keeper that feeds me
That helps me make decisions
He is were my home is
He will take a bullet, or knife
To throat
He is my and all ways will be my keeper
My brother Lamont
My brother is my keeper
My brother is my best friend
My brother is my pain
My brother is my hero
