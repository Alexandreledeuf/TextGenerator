will i ever see you again?
or have i lost another friend?

but i want you to know
that i miss you more than i can show
dear brother
it's been a while
since you last made me smile
and i know you had to leave
but i want you here with me
because i miss you terribly
dear brother
will you ever come home?
or am i never to know?
and i wish you didn't have to go
but i want you to know
that i miss you more than i can show
