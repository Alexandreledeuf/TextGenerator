My sister and brother grew up without their dad
though they wouldn't admit it, I knew it made them sad
Our mom always did the best that she could
for she knew he was out of their lives for good
It was his choice to stay out of their lives
it was the love of his children himself he did deprive
Now they are older and off on their own
His rejection of them he could never atone
out stepdad has been a better father then, their dad could ever be
Our stepdad has been our constant our solid oak tree
