I remember that dreadful morning,
Waking to the beast,
Time had stopped, the news reckless
A beautiful boy amazing but deceased
I heard my heart shatter  and my soul screamed a cry
The couler the detail I remember like yesterday
But I just wished I’d I said a final goodbye,
Ruthless pain i hide so deep inside,
I wish I could take you just once
With me for a ride,
Because I don’t remember if I even held you,
And now I cant even call you, or even hear your voice,
But I need to tell you i still love you
And yes I know I need to let go, but I know I cant just let you go
I need to hold you in my arms, in my life
Just one more time
Because my heart is broken from not saying good bye
Im sorry I never said goodbye or held you the day you died
WHY OH WHY
Did I not say good bye
But my love is here with the tears
I miss you my brother dear,
I love you
