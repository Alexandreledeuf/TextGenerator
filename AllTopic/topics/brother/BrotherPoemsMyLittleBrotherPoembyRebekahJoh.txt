Sticky fingers and a chocolate face
Broken toys and a broken vase
Cars and trucks here and there
Boats and crayons everywhere
Bats and balls strewn in the yard
Sweaty face from playing hard
Broken bones and bloody knees
Stings from ants and wasps and bees
Feet stomping on the floor
Fingerprints on the sliding door
A painful cry and a whimpering whine
A mischevious smile that seems to shine
Face being licked by the dog
Rolling around in the mud like a hog
Housing reptiles of all shapes and sizes
Always full of odd surprises
Tracking mud from shoes and clothes
Yet another bloody nose
Sneaking cookies from the cookie jar
Face streaked black with mud and tar
Ketchup stains on your new shirt
Brand new shoes covered with dirt
Sometimes you can be quite a bother
But I love you anyways because you're my little brother
