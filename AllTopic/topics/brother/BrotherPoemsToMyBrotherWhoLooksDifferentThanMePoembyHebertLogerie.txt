The first time, we met; you treated me,
Like a sibling, like a brother.
It was friendship; it was love at first sight;
In a very short time, you became my faithful mentor,
The good shepherd despite your prestigious might.
You do not discriminate against anybody;
You are the man that I yearn to emulate:
The consummate professional, the prelate,
Who fights the right battle, and who, eventually,
Won justice for your sanity and for others.
When we worked together, you were not perfect,
However, I could rely in you and trusted your ways;
You had a way of dealing with the imperfect
World, you had a way to warn me of the dangers.
A man can love another man for his good character,
For good morale, and unblemished behaviors.
Even now, you are still a brother, not an actor;
You remain frank and truthful with me all the time.
My brother, you were the perfect employer,
You stood by me in good time and in bad time.
When things got tough with the impostors,
I stood by you, because I knew that you were innocent;
Because I knew that you had strong work ethics
.
God has a way of protecting people, who are decent;
Family men like you and me,
Quality men like you and me.
Even though that we look very different
From each other;
You will forever
Remain my beloved brother.
I thank you for your understanding,
You are my star; I thank you for everything.
