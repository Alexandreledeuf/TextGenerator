My Little Brother…You grew up so promisingly
I glad I had you as a brother as you will have my back
I’m so proud of you!
As you getting straight A’s in your classes
You told me that you wished you was me but
You shouldn’t! I want you to be yourself
Show this world how it should be run
I read your poetry with great pride
I wish you would see through my eyes
But don’t worry my words will speak it for me
I think you are a king in the making.
You read about our black leaders and always
Striving for knowledge just like me and the scholars
You are the lion of the family as you let our enemies
Hear you roar with your fists and your remarks
Brother don’t worry life will get easy for you
As your hard work will pay as a special girl
Will notice you from a distance and hunt you down
You have you as her king and you will have a queen
People will follow your greatness and your footsteps
You are destined for great things as God foresee this fate
As I am proud to say I am your big brother I can look at you
Become the world’s next big thing I lay back in my
Vault of poetry to write on until my heart stops beating
And have the future generation to found my poetry and say
“A genius wrote this” I love you bro. Live free and lead on!
