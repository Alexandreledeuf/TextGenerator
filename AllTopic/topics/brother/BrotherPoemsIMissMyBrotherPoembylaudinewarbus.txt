In hte ghetto you'll never know when it's gonna be your time.
sitten here in the ghetto thinken about time we had,
gawd damn i miss my brother Janus Warbus.
How could it be somebody took my bro from me
my funny brother is gone and now o feel all alone
I really miss my brother Janus Eugene Warbus.
Even though he's gone away i know he's in a better place,
and i hope to see him some day.
I used to ahng my bro
even slang with my bro
gawd damn i miss my bro
it's so hard to see my brother in the dirt that's ten feet under.
His kids are so adoreable
they start to look like him each and mintue of there life's
it's so hard to see my brother riden in that black car,
man i miss my brother
Janus Eugene Warbus
