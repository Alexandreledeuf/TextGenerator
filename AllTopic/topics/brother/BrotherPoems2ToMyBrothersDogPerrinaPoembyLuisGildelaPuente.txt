The first day you woke me up,
did you open the door
or did I leave it open?
How could you know?
There were blinds
on the windows
and yet you knew
that was the first snow
of a long winter,
“it´s a clear winter morning,
let´s go and enjoy the snow”.
You knew
when to touch my hand
to tell me
life is waiting
let´s go play.
You knew
the best definition
for happiness.
Open your eyes and enjoy.
Let´s go play.
You knew
the exact measure
of truth,
of danger.
The secret
must be
the smell.
