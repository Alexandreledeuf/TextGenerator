My brother's in a wheelchair
and he can't jump or run
but I can throw a ball to him
to catch and we have fun.
He can't do a lot of things
that other kids can do.
He needs help getting dressed
and he can't tie his shoes.
Mommy told me it's called 'special'
when a child is born that way.
I said I could have told her that...
My brother's special every day.
