He lies near to death
Dying in the dust
Broken and forgot.
Now his children
Once mighty tribes
Fall before the setting sun.
His women - - young and old
Dead and dying
Host the killer AIDS.
He calls for help
To rich brothers in the West
But his cries fall upon stone-deaf ears.
For they find no profit
Supplying HIV drugs
To those who cannot pay.
