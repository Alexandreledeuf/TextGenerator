my brother's so sweet
in times of need he is there
my brother's so responsible
he taught me a lot of things
my brother's so funny
we even teared from laughing
my brother's so fierce
don't mess with him when his angry
my brother fell inlove
and he's very very happy
my brother made up his mind
and had a nice sweet family
my brother is away
i'm sad when i think of it
but my brother's heart is good
and i know he will never forget me.
