My heart feels so troubled by the things that fate has done,
I love you dear brother, to me you're number one.
I set here by myself, your picture in my hand,
thinking about you living in another land.
You my dear, sweet brother, are everything to me,
My heart, my life, my happiness all the good I see.
Though you're ill, and feeling sad I want you to know,
If life were to take you away,  my love for you wont go.
I'll remember all the days we shared as little children having fun,
Jumping, climbing, birthdays from now back to when we where young.
Dear brother you'll never really leave me, no you wont depart,
and if, God, saw fit to take you, I'll forever keep you in my heart.
