Tell me something my Cyber Lover,
do you happen to have a brother?
It's just I have a Cyber Friend out there,
and for her welfare I really care
He must of course be the perfect man,
and write like you, tell me he can?
For I cannot possibly share you,
my heart would simply break in two!
(LOL - for 'L')
