On a special delayed morning
When I was still snoring
My mom was taken to the hospital
For she was a very pregnant lady
She returned home with a gift
A gift I still cherish
For she brought home for me, a brother
A cute and cuddly li’l baby you
Your baby steps trodden my mind
And each time you trip,
I made sure to catch you
Your blinking eyes were baby blue
Scribbled with many forget-me-nots
Your hugs were tempting
It comforted me
Your soft kisses
Were heavenly sent!
I stayed by you
In the days you grew
I gazed to see
What a man you’ll be
I walked like a shadow
Tracing your each step
I wanted to guide you
Through your wrongs and mistakes
I’ll miss this angel
In years to come
For you’ll be busy
With work to do
I write this poem here, right now
‘Coz this is my only way
To show how much I love you
To prove that I care!
(WRITTEN FOR A BROTHER I ALWAYS WISHED TO HAVE)
