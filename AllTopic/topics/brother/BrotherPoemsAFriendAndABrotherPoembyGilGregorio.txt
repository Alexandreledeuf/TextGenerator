I was groping for a friend
in a net of eyes by the tube;
I was looking for a brother
in a heart of dearness as old;
I am sharing for a life
to a friend not yet known;
I am trusting a brother
at a distance my dreams've shown.
I am talking to a friend
in a net of dearness by the tube;
I am looking at his eyes
seemed like Moses of old.
I am sharing for a life
to a friend now yet called
at a distance shared a promise
for a newfound life yet assured;
for at a distance, a friend
and a brother, now behold;
he's there, I'm here yet embracing
in this little lovely world.
