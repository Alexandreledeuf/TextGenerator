to my baby brother on the anniversary of your birth,
to my little brother your make my world spin, my earth,
20th june 07-
As school drew to a close i ran to get to you,
On the way to the hospital, the moment becoming true,
arrival around 4pm and found mum in the room,
she looked like she was all drugged up no element of gloom,
I had to leave for home about 5 o'clock, didnt want to go,
I was so excited to be told the information written below;
Thomas
8lb 1oz
52cm
Healthy boy
7: 35pm - 20/06/2007
little did i know he would now become the most precious thing in my life,
that he would nag, moan, groan and whine at me until he had his own wife,
T is for Terrific
H is for Huggable
O is for rOund xx
M is for Mine!
A is for Awwwwwww....
S is for Something unique
That something unique is a brother/sister bond,
When i say a word his laughter responds,
He brings an extra meaning into my busy world,
But somehow theres always time for him my boy, my brother, my whole entire world! ! x
