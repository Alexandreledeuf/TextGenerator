Humankind has come far in technology so very far 'twould seem
Back in the nineteen fifties of such achievements we dared not dream
In this age of the computer Big Brother reigns supreme
To him we have become as visible as fish in a clear pool of a sunlit stream.
Big Brother knows more about you now than he has ever known before
And he watches every move you make even from a distant shore
He knows your inner secrets into your soul he see
With the aid of the computer and modern technology.
Big Brother not a benign character he has never been that way
He judge you for your opinions and everything you say
Goes into his computer a dossier on you he create
For Government Bureaucrats for to use against you in some future date.
The pinnacle of human achievements we are told we have not seen
And Big Brother is more powerful now than he has ever been
With the aid of modern technology he looks into your soul
And the loss to us of privacy is beyond our control.
