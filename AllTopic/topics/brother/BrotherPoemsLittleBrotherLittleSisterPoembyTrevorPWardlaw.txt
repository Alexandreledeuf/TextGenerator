Little brother, can’t you see
You follow me around like a bumble bee
Taking and using all my toys
You cry so much, its too much noise
Little sister, can’t you tell
You’re perfume has a very strange smell
Dancing and singing, then you weep
Stop coming in my room so I may sleep
But wait!  I love you two
Without your company there’s nothing to do
