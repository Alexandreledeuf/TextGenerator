I sometimes get angry at my mother,
For giving birth to such a naughty brother!
He'll never be my kind of lover,
Mostly because he scribbled on my favourite magazine cover.
'He is such a brat. I'll never love him! ' I say,
My mother replies, 'You never know, one day you may.'
In front of my parents he'll act very sweet,
They call him, 'Our Little Parakeet'.
Behind their back, he makes faces at me,
And if I shout, he'll start crying so my mom can see!
I'm really tired of him hanging around,
More so, I'm tired of hearing his stupid sound.
I've got to put up a board in the backyard without telling my mother,
It says in red ink, 'Adopt a brother'!
