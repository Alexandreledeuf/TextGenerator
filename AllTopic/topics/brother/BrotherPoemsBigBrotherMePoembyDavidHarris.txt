I have a friend far across the sea.
We have never met,
but she is never far away.
Our hands have never touched,
but our hearts have,
through our words
that bring comfort and console.
We are not related,
but a big brother she thinks I am.
She is always writing
about this distant friend.
So now is my chance
to write one for her.
I hope when she reads it
she will get a silly grin.
