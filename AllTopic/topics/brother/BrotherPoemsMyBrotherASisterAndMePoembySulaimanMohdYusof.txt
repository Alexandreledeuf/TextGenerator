She’s lying on the bed, comatose
No familiar faces around, she could stare
Ironic, there was a smell of calitos
Rising up breezily into the air
Somewhere, a patient has died
Of drug overdose
Superstition belief, is to bear
The curse’s door, is to close
Yesterday someone knocked her down
Whilst she was walking down the road
But no one could be found
As who to blame for the sin load
My brother, a sister and me
Watching helplessly
A mother’s love is about to cease
Taste of life will be bitter
God, help us please
You too have taken away our father
My brother, a sister and me
Will life be better?
Those we loved are no longer here
Eternal pains will be forever
My brother, a sister and me
Living in naive, poverty and fear
Thinking who will be
In the next tier,
Climbs to You
To be with our father
And…probably our mother
Too
