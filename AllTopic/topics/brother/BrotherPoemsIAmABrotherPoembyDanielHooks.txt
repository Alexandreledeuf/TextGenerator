I am one of the least of your brothers.
I am neither your son or your lover.
I am just another.
I am just a face in the crowd.
Neither silent or loud.
I just need your love and support
People are my court.
They decide whether I should live or die
Or sit on the pavement and cry.
Give me faith give me hope
Because I cannot cope.
I have no distinctive features
I am no street preacher
Sometimes I am a wretched creature.
I have no money I am poor
Siting with my begging bowl on the floor.
Knocking on your door
For shelter on your floor!
I have no girlfriend I cannot score
No one cares for me anymore.
I stink but I try not to think
I try not to think
I try not to think that I wish I hadn't been born.
I have a yawnâ€¦..
Then I sleep on a park bench till dawn.
