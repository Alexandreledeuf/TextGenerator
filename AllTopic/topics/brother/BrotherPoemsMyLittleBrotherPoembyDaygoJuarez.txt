My little brother is full of joy
One of the few things in life that I enjoy
He always loves to go to the park
But he’s still afraid of the dark
My little brother knows I go to school
But for this he thinks I’m cool
He always loves to smile
To see this smile, would be worthwhile.
My little brother has a big heart
My little brother is pure art.
