I think of you and shed a tear
I'd cry a million if they could bring you back here
That night when you left and said goodbye,
I did not know the next morning you would die.
Now that your gone, god how I wish,
I’d stop that night to give you a kiss.
It always felt safe there in your arms,
None could match your beauty and charms
I love you brother and the world should know;
That you were not meant to grow old,
As young as you were and as smart as I am
I know you were not part of a long life’s plan.
To bright before us you shone from afar,
I knew somehow you would be killed by a car.
Fast to exit, too fast for me,
but long will you be remembered you see.
For you were the one that everyone liked,
my brother, my friend, up to mischief and strife,
For some reason a wife was not part of your life’s plan,
no children were sired to add to our clan
My brother, how proud I am to say,
that you were my brother,
I miss you today.
Your wit and your charm, your style and grace
you were too good for this human race
You died so long ago, when we  were both young,
we thought our lives had only just begun,
It is sad and I just want you to know
I wish you'd had  the chance to see my boy grow,
I am married now you see,
with a son and two daughters living happily.
You are often in my thoughts as I watch my Blake grow;
I see his spark, and cheeky grin,
the shape of his eye and the angle of his chin.
I watch his smile; I sit and think of you awhile.
I hope you see me from above,
and know I am sending you all my love
