Terrorists struck without warning!
Coming out of a clear blue sky
On a beautiful cool morning,
Leaving us to wonder why
They’d kill women and children,
Muslim, Buddhist and Jew,
Hindu, Shinto and Christian,
To name only a few...
One brother against another,
We aren’t so different at birth
Teaching makes us hate each other
And lessens our own self worth...
Hatred begets hatred,
Your victory is to make more like you,
But in the end you’re dead
And “Victory” is dust and ashes, too
Yes, terrorists struck without seeing,
Killing all in their blindness,
But the most meaningful responses
Were random acts of kindness....
