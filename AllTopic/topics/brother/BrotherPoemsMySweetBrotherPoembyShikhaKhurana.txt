My sweet brother…! ! !
I am blessed with a sweet little brother,
And I am thankful to god that he didn’t give me someone other,
We went to the same school,
And had our food in the same dining room,
Books had been his greatest enemies,
But he had to study because there was no other remedy,
Red marks were prominent in his result,
But still he never took them as an insult,
He believed in being playful,
And this was the only thing which he considered to be useful…! !
But now he is a grown up guy,
Who doesn’t like toys and is not shy,
He is the one with whom I can share,
And he listens to me and never ever stares,
He cannot see a tear in my eye,
And this makes me feel not to give up and to try forever,
He has now become very responsible,
And I know if he gets the support he is very capable,
He is self obsessed with his looks,
And convinces us either by hook or by crook…! !
I am gonna get married in a while,
And I know he has already decided about the style,
As he is there I am not worried about my mom,
Because I know his care and love will make her strong,
I am sorry for my mistakes,
But I love you to the core and this is one thing which no one can
take…! !
Love you bhai….thanks for supporting me….! !
