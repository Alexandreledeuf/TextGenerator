My Brother is very bad
He always makes my mother sad
By complaining about me to her
And sometimes to my big fat sir
Never you would suspect him
of doing the smallest bad thing
But as his elder brother I know
How he will be when he grows!
Once He tore my science book
And gave me a wicked look
After I complained to my mother
My cute little brother,
Clasped my mom by her neck
And began to sob, which was(of course)   fake
'Come on, now look at his face
He can't do such a thing'she says
This was much a disgrace,
So I ran to hit his face,
But as I tried to beat him, I slipped,
And on the Ground Tripped,
Then Against the floor I bumped my head,
And Opened my eyes in the hospital bed!
