Falling through memory's wide open window,
Hitherto kept tightly closed.
I'm flying away into chilhood experience
Where, brother and I were supposed
To be good, while parental strife, flaring
Brightly, would envelope us nightly,
As arms flung round each other
We struggled to sleep,
Despite shouting and fighting
Downstairs, we said pleading prayers
And, always tearful goodnights.
We often cried quietly
Into the darkness my brother and I.
Orphaned from love, we grew close
Together, and clung to each other
Over the ensuing years.
Losing my only beautiful brother
To cancer has emptied and drained
My  lonely heart, despite
Crying rivers of tears.
I reluctantly close that window again
But never will close on my brother, Den.
