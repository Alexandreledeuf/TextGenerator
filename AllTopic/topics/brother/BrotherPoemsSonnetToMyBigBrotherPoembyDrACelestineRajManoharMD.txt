You are the best I have, my brother nice!
I know so well you suffer too like me;
Your heart is honest, broadminded, and wise;
I pray God must bless you quite soon surely.
You have a mind well-read, of course and sane;
I know that life has been to you unkind!
You are a boon, the elder son not bane;
Do continue your good work, I remind.
You are the one in whom I can confide;
Ever ready to help others always;
Don’t worry much, be brave; in God abide;
They are so nigh, your lucky, happy days.
So far, you have done well in life, don’t brood;
Be undeterred and never spoil your mood!
