The first born of the family
Brought happiness and prosperity
Even his name represents that
“Aklil” means “crown” in Tigrinya
He paid his life with no doubt
Stood for his people for his home land
Such a good brother and son
So young and a sweet one
Too unfair to be gone
How can I forget his smiley face
So cute and decent our family’s grace
Life has been too mean to you
Beloved brother I miss you
While I’m obsess through sadness
Realize if it weren’t you and the others
Paid life and brought this peace
We wouldn’t live and blithe
Not even be able to breath
Beloved brother, we all are proud of you
Even though we crazily missing you
The short good times we shared
Is what I deeply engraved
And I always miss that
“Aklilu” your memory is in my heart
Never thought life could be that short
You deserve to live and it really hurt
My beloved “Aklil” this poem is for you
I wanted the whole world to know you
I love you and I really miss you! ! ! !
N.B I wrote this poem for my brother who martyrs at the war between Eritrea and Ethiopia On May 17 2000 at the age of 24 in a specific place named Adi-rakba
