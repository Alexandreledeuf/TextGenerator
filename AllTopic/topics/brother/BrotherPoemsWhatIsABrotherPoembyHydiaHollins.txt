What is a brother?
Someone who is there
when you are hurting
He picks you up
and dusts you off again
What is a brother?
Someone who sees you are without a smile
And he gives you one of his
and gives you a hug too
just especially for you
What is a brother?
Someone who stands by your side
and holds your hand
when things donâ€™t go well
He helps you understand
What is a brother?
A cherished friend for life
a brother by blood
A cousin or friend
But always by love
