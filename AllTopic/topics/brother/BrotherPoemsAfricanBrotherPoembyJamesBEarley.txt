Who was the villain
When it all began
Some fair-haired stranger
From a faraway land
Or the African brother
Selling his neighbor away
In exchange of whatever
The fair-haired stranger would pay
For the brutal betrayal
Of his own damned kin
Has anything changed
Since the original sin
Who was the villain
