Why dont you come home at nights?
Why are you always getting into fights?
Why are your eyes always so red?
Why do you seem like your hanging by a thread?
Why are you always in a bad mood?
Why dont you come home....except for food?
Why dont I hear from you? Your always with your friends.
Please, tell me what we did wrong, I'll gladly make amends.
Where does all your money go?
Wait...dont tell me...I dont want to know.
Please pull yourself together. Make something of your life
Buy a house, settle down, have children with a wife...
Please stop doing all this foolishness you do.
But remember, no matter what. I will always love you.
Brother, dear brother
whatever you choose.
whatever you lose
I wont abandon you,
never....I refuse
I'll be by your side to the very end.
When all your friends leave, I'll be your best friend
Just please let me help you fix your bad choices.
When choosing your path...let your family be the voices.
We'll guide you to life
We'll guide you to hope
We'll guide you away
from the booze and the dope
So please make room in your heart for the ones who love you.
We'll be with you forever. We love you through and through.
