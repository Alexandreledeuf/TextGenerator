Burning! Burning! Whole world is burning
Erased ghettos, razing down skyscrapers
Mowed out farms, fields and meadows
Smoldering woods, thickets and vines
Thawing glaciers and boiling polar waters
War-fire far and wide; wild and torrid
Melting earth into oceans
Asia and Australia in shambles
Africa reduced to hot ashes
And South America under mercenary cap
Screaming, shouting and crying everywhere
Whole human world looking like God’s acre
In the bloody gore, pillage, mire and pyre
Scurrying kith and kin, in rubble, gathering
Scattered limbs of their near and dear ones
Tragedy reigning; hungry cinders remaining
In ravaged homes and ruined lives
“Ha! Ha! Ha! What a scene! How picturesque! ”
Dream broke! Big Brother awoke!
With cold sweat on his face and
Cold feeling sweeping his fetish mind
Smiled he in wild ‘sadist’faction at his reverie
Muttered he to himself in glee
“I will! I will! Fulfill this dream!
And slake this thirst! This hunger and this lust!
With hysterical urge reach those orgasmic crests
And stand there laughing my heart out
And shout, shout and shout like a lunatic
I am Lord! I am God! I am the Almighty! ! ! ”
