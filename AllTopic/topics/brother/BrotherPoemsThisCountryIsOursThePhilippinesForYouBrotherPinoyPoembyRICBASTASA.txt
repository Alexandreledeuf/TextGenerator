And we shall not leave
This country we shall build
Because it is ours
Throughout the golden hours
Here we belong
For quite long
Our great forefather
Was buried here
And though in poverty
We must stay
As we enjoy what we have
Under the sun we love
The coolness of the moon
We all swoon and don
We shall be proud as a tree
We enjoy our liberty
We shall live we shall die
There is no reason to cry
