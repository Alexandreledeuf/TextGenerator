We all make our mistakes in life and for that payment is always in full,
Regardless of our actions our decisions leads us to either victory or defeat;
A learning proccess that as humans we all must pass, even at our childhood we gain experience with hard knocks;
Having sometimes a blind eye to the truths or deaf to our conscious of a fool,
Hoping that as we proceed in life the past stays in the past and doesn’t hunt us;
Not realizing that we involve people that love us;
Consequences that influence many of those who are constantly in our minds,
Separation of a love one is a difficult task; Regardless whether is a mother, brother, son or daughter;
Waking up to an empty soul feels like an ocean with a bottomless floor,
Like darkness not knowing whether your next step is forward or stumble into the unknown,
Now we must part you must go one way as I must remain,
A brother I never new must part his own way,
Soon we’ll be together I understand, soon we share a laughter once again;
I’ll remain your brother thru thick and thin; you must pay for your action as they say,
Don’t worry; for brood is thicker than water and no matter what you will always be my brother.
