my brother he is lost to me,
grew up and he out grew me.
moved away to hide from dad,
left me all alone and sad.
now he's forced to live a lie,
scared away by one big cry.
he wrecked the car so dad wrecked him,
kicked him out and forced hate in.
he's run away many times before,
but now he's allowed in no more.
pretend like and fake love,
my dad is now so filled of.
they can be together for just mere minutes,
then the fight begins before us.
hide the pain, we try to do,
but once again it just breaks through.
way to young to be on his own,
but he's still left alone.
now all i have left to say,
is i hope to see him free one day.
free of pain, and free to hope,
and free for him and his love to elope.
