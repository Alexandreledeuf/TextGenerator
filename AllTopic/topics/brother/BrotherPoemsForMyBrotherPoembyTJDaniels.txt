You were still my brother
no matter what you did
or how you lived
and I loved you.
We were not as close
in latter years
as we were
when we were younger.
I wish you were here
so I could hold you
one last time
before you had to go.
The last time I saw you
you looked so very cold.

Who Died Last Year)
