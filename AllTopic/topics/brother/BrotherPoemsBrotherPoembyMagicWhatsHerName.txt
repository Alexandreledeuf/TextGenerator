Someone who wants to be a rocker
Known as my brother
Always playing guitar.
So annoying
Drives me crazy
Tell him to get up
Because he's lazy.
Pretending to be
Someone he's not
Nothing wrong with that
But please at eleven at night
Let's get some shut eye
And turn off the light.
*(For you my brother, For there is no other) *
