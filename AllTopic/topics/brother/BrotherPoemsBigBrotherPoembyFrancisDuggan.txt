Big Brother he is always watching you
And nothing unbeknown to him you do
Of his attentions none of us are free
We never can escape his scrutiny.
Big Brother is one we never get to know
Though he spies on us where ever to we go
Our sixth sense tells us he is never far away
He never cease to watch us night and day.
Big Brother is an agent of the State
And few would wish to have him as a mate
No respect for your privacy he show
And due to him the Government about you most thing know.
A faceless soul he is one we never see
And of his attentions we cannot be free
A silent spy he never makes a sound
And unbeknown to us he follows us around.
Along the street as by houses you walk by
From behind curtained windows on you he does spy
Big Brother watches you by night and day
And from you he is never far away.
