I loved you once, you took me in
With chubby cheeks you made me grin
I love you for you give me back
Without hiding in your sack
Once I found you in  my teens
Made me pretty, all my means
Found you grow me all seasons
Nature filling moons and suns
For some time you missed me there
Then I found me missing here
Dancing I was with my dear
Lust and love, hai! keep me cheer
You made me reflect without mask
All these questions may I ask
Without answer you showed me
Wife and mother I can be
With grey hair I thought wisdom come
Grey hair did not make wise some
Wisdom gained, I found me failed
Oh! Mirror, can you make me resolved
I thought you keep me all absorbed
Without letting time involved
But, I found in you me sold
Once decked with a speck of gold
