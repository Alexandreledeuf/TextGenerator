Why don’t you do it?
Why cause me pain?
Can’t you make up your mind?
Won’t you love again?
You say that you’ll do it
The love will return
The warm smell of comfort
The passion will burn
The fire within you
Will ignite again
They’ll be no holding back
No want for refrain
Your thoughts are deceitful!
Why do you lie!
One way conversation
There is no reply
Your glacier expression
Please consider it all
Think on what I’ve said
As you hang on the wall
