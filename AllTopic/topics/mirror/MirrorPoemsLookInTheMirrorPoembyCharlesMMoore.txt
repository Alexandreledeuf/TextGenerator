If you looked in the mirror
what would you see
a face full of anger and hypocrisy
would you study the eyes
with their bridge to the soul
and say there's a person
whose honesty shows
would the lines tell some story
of trouble you knew
and how you had struggled
to finally pull through
would the features combined
say there's someone who's kind
with benevolent heart
for the rest of mankind.
