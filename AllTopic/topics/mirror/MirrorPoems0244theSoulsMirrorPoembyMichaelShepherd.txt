Do you wish to know what is your 'soul',
in all its glory, and its whole estate?
To know if it knows but a part, or All?
Its birth; its growth, its life - or lives; its fate?
Is it the watcher, even of itself?
Is it its own revealer, beyond words?
Can wise men tell us its true health and wealth?
If not, can we be sure that it exists?
For lack of witness to the soul's true bounds,
then, witness all the wonders of the world
of nature, beauty, law: then, what responds
in our self's mirror, is soul's map unfurled:
unbounded witness to its Maker; masked,
until for glorious proof of this it's asked!
