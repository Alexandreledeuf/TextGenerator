A mirror hung upon a wall.
A man, quite handsome, also tall
stepped up to look inside the glass
and gave himself the nod, the pass.
He saw exquisite, handsome features
superior to all other creatures.
Black hair and pearl white teeth to smile
Amana suit completes the style.
His nails were short and manicured
flat stomach muscles had endured
so many sessions of the crunches
and, from inside,   Martini lunches.
Two diamonds hung from his sleeves
and maple golden rings, like leaves
adorned pink ears and looked expensive
his jewellery was quite extensive
and in addition, on his arms
two Rolexes, with loud alarms.
He stood and looked from head to toes
but did not know a mirror shows
to all the world just your outside
what counts is all the things you hide.
