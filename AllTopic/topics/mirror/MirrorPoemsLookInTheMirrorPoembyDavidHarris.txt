I look in the mirror
And what do I see
A reflection of someone else
Staring out at me
I see someone I used to know
Someone who used to be me
As I look in the mirror
Thatâ€™s what I see
One drink led to another
A drunkard I became
Now my poor family
Are looked on with shame
Empty bottles fill every corner
Money I have none
My wife and children go hungry
As I crawl around the floor
As the days grew longer
The worse I became
Bottle followed bottle
Perfecting my shame
I yelled and I shouted
Strange things did I see
But none were more stranger
Than a reflection of me
