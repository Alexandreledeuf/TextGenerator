The girl out of the mirror
Looks sad and pale
that’s how shell die
Alone and frail
The girl in the mirror
smiling is she
She looks happy and joyful
Why shouldn’t she be
The girl out of the mirror
Unhappy in life
Is upset with herself
Keeps watching her knife
The girl in the mirror is
Smiling
Joking
Buying
The girl out of the mirror is
Sighing
Weeping
Dying
