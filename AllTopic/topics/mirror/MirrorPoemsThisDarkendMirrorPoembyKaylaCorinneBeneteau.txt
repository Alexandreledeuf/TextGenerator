on the other side,
you cannot see,
what a broken record i can be,
this darkend mirror,
hiding all my fear,
that only i can see,
in this darkend reflection stareing back at me,
it seems if the world is spinning so fast,
and i know that my life will not last,
falling  to the ground in pain,
when i go who will you blame?
i'm such a misfit lost in the world,
i was fine before,
but i cannot see no more,
for i am blinded by death.
