Indolence blocks effulgence
Ignorance swallows intelligence
Arrogance eats brilliance
Adamance fuels anarchism!
Jealousy blinds compassion
Envy engulfs erudition
Anger gulps ambition
Lust kills affection!
All may be a transcient phase
Just as  dust on the mirror's face
And moving clouds shadowing moon
Returning its eternal light sure very soon
With wit and will we can erase
And lend glory to life sans the evil trace!
