when you look in the mirror
it scares you to see your reflection
a worthless human being
who drags through the day
and wishes nightfall would come quicker
so you could hide that ugly face
the window to your soul
where people can see the rotting insides
so much rejection and pain
its too much
a simple punch
a loud smash
and that ugly reflection
is no more than a shattered mirror.
