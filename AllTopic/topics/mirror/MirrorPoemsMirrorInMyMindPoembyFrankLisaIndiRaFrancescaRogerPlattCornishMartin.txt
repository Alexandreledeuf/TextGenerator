A husky accented “Hi”
An act of concealment
Alack! ! very shoddy
Avers all the painfully mined
Poetry and philosophy;
as overtures
in genre of also-ran
T ’was a candor or stupor
That split the grandeur of whole
Into pores and pixels
“Hey you are fat and ugly
‘n logistically challenged
Hah! Nostrils filled with
Whiff of fresh lime of
Sense, symmetry and algorithm
Makes breathing a rather
Funny affair with flabs dancing
To tarry forth I’m offloading
the mirror in my mind
Dropping dreams in a basket
At some unknown door
m free m free m free
Hail to sanity
Long live fidelity
