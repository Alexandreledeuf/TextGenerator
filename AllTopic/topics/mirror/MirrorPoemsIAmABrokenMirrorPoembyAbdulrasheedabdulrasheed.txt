I am a broken mirror,
Which was broken when you look.
There is a hidden rose in my heart,
And never laugh at me as a kook.
I am a broken mirror,
Where was broken in the nook.
No one knows me and my love,
And never looked my rose or took.
I am a broken mirror,
Just as a myth in the old book.
You never read it even in dream,
Never read a line even is a hook.
I am a broken mirror,
But show you complete even every part.
It'll show clear spring to you,
Forever show to you my broken heart.
