A resolute presentation on the edge of a dawn infiltration;
foundations firmly planted on a bed of ignorant fertility
Sullen condensation; a viscous fog totters in,
Seething and breathing its roiling, heavy, rolling sum,
sternly nurturing its torrential attrition:
physical, chemical; constantly, incisively
The morning, left uncomfortable, promises a cloudy noon.
Shadows within evergreen resplendence sigh with Night.
In fluid variegation, flowers bloom while brambles ensnare,
a bittersweet cooperation of estranged provocation:
collaborating selfishly, persistently inseperable,
unforgiving in the umbra of a crepuscular grudge.
Shivering silver sliver slips slowly to the sky,
ensorcelling wood and beast.
Deep forests' darkness claim the very earth
heedlessly flaunting its haunted emptiness.
nocturnal hunger: stalking, lusting,
challenges thorns and tramples flowers,
pursuing secret roots for repast; blind,
A haggard satisfaction; an unnecessary tempest
Sickening garden decomposed: a profusion of rot,
steaming mournfully out into the sombre midnight
