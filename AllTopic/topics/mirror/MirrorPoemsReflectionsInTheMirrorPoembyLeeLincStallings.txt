When you look in the mirror
Do you see only yourself?
Could the reflection be your soul,
Staring yoack in the face?
If there is a crack in the mirror,
Is that not a reflection of you?
The mirror reveals merely what your eyes
Want us to see
But could not a clearer reflection
Mirror infinity?
