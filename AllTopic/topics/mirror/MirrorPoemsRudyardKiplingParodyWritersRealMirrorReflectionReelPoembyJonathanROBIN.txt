With inside out, and out, surprised, inside!
When penning verse whose end may, too, begin it,
When rhyming reel with real can coincide
Yours is the world and everything that’s in it
If you can write without cash motivation,
Self-righteousness avoiding like the plague,
Create consensus round an innovation
Embraced by all without appearing vague.
If you can scan, span logic to emotion
Set constant course from vested interests clear,
If you can ban all untoward commotion,
While conscience clings to all that it holds dear,
If rhymes may improvise, spurn prose redrafted,
Communication keyed to catalyze,
You'll find to your surprise that you have rafted
On stream it seems when wit reverse dream tries
