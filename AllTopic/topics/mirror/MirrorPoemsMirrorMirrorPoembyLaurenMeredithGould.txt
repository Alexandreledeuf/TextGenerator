Mirror, mirror
On the wall.
How old will I be
When I fall?
Mirror, mirror,
In the locker.
Will I be famous in baseball,
or should I try soccer?
Mirror, mirror,
On the door.
Where will I be,
When I'm twenty-four?
Mirror, mirror,
In my purse.
When will this be over?
I hate the search.
Mirror, mirror,
Up above.
I'm getting married,
I found my true love.
Mirror, mirror,
In my hand.
I'm in Hawaii,
With my toes in the sand.
Mirror, mirror,
In the water,
I'm sitting here crying,
With my daughter.
Mirror, mirror,
You have been sold,
Mirror, mirror,
I'm getting so old.
Mirror, mirror,
Broken on the floor.
Here I am now,
Ninety-four.
Mirror, mirror,
On the TV,
I am dying,
Now I shall leave.
Mirror, mirror,
You were my mother's.
Mirror, mirror,
No you're her daughter's.
Mirror, mirror,
You've been through a lifetime.
Mirror, mirror,
You have been so kind.
Mirror, mirror,
You shall sleep,
Mirror, mirror,
You are done...so sleep.
