Mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the fairest of us all
If you did happen to answer
there would be no doubt
My reflection would be over
& I would simply pass out
But now we have had
this little conversation
I have something to confess
I really like the new reflection
It's filled with happiness
An enormous smile has chased
that serious face away
It has taken off years
And those laughter lines
look really good today
