SILENCE,  THHE MIRROR POSSESSES THE POWERS OF ATTENTION
AS MUCH POWER AS THE GOLDEN HARVEST ALONG THE ROAD-SIDE UNHIDDEN
THE MIRROR SPEAKS A LANGUAGE THAT TELLS NO LIES
INFACT, THE MIRROR ENTRAPS ILLUSION AND RECAPS THE EYES
.....  LEAVING NO MYSTERIES OF WHATS BEHIND
INTUNED,  THE MIRROR FEEDS OFF THE SKY- ITS FAVORITE FEAST IS THE SUN
.....  MUNCHING, CRUNCHING, SWALLOWED, HOWEVER CONSUMED
THE MIRROR IS MORE TANTALIZING THAN ANY MOON
THE MIRROR PULLS AND REFLECTS LIKE A STORY THAT EACH AND ALL CAN RELATE
PEOPLE FRIENDLY, VERY KIND AND NEVER FAKE
THE MIRROR TELLS THE GOOD AND THE BAD, SO BE PREPARED FOR TRUTH
THATS WHY I TRUST AND LOVE MY MIRROR..... BECAUSE IT SAYS I BELONG W/ YOU
MIRROR MIRROR- koom ba ye....aka the greatest crush ever
