I look at this girl before me
She's familiar, yet unknown
She's reaching out to touch me
She's abandoned and alone
She's living in a nightmare
Her eyes are tightly shut
She can't stand to see her pain
Caused by those she used to trust
She tries to speak, and cry for help
But her words will not come out
It's like nobody can hear her
No matter how loud she shouts
I'm the only one who understands
The torture she's been through
Her mind's been toyed and played with
And her heart has been abused
Now if her heart is broken
Can I put it back in place?
Can I wipe away the teardrops
That are falling down her face?
Can I erase the memories
That are deep inside her mind?
Can I take away the hurting
That she's suffered all her life?
And can I make her smile
When all she does is frown?
Can i pick her up and hold her
When she's lying on the ground
Can I hide her imperfections
If they're all she ever sees?
How do I tell her she's pretty
If she doesn't know what it means?
And if she wants to be alone
Am I supposed to follow?
How do I turn the light on
If she's hidden in the shadow?
And if she turns to walk away
Do I try to pull her nearer?
How do i help the person
That I see inside the mirror?
