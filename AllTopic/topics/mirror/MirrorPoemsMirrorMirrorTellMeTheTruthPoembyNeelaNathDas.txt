Who is more beautiful
we or our mind?
Should we tell the truth openly
or bite one from behind?
Mirror, mirror tell me
soon, don't keep suspense- - - -
can morality be sold,
in pound, dollar or in  pence?
If anyone hurts without
any cause, should I keep patience?
Mirror, mirror, tell him now,
his digs  make no  sense.
