Mirror Mirror
tell me what do you see
who am I?
I sometimes wonder who is she
Mirror Mirror
Do you love me?
As I look into you I see a reflection of me
I see a little girl who was and can never be
Grown into a woman
There's this older woman sits alone
starring back at me
Mirror Mirror
Hold up!
What is this I see
I turned back trying to figure out why is she me
I study her for awhile
wondering is this suppose to be
Mirror Mirror
your eyes the window of your soul I see
It holds a story that is untold
Mirror Mirror
That image I see
is it my shadow looking back at me?
Oops!
its she who is me?
