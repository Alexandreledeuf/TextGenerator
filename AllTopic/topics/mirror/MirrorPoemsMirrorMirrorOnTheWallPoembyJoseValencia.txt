Mirror, Mirror on the wall
Why can't I be the smartest of all
Mirror, Mirror on the wall
Why can't I found true love at all
Mirror, Mirror on the wall
Why can't I stop cutting myself
Mirror, Mirror on the wall
Why do I feel lonley all the time
Mirror, Mirror on the wall
Why do i feel stupid every day
Mirror, Mirror on the wall
Why do you make me feel sad all the time.
