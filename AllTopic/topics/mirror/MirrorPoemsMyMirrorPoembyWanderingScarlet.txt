Im lost,
Ive been this way, ten years to the day,
i still cannot find what I am looking for
until,
I found my mirror,
at first i overlooked its powers,
but i suddenly saw the beauty
I saw hope, something save my from my terror
i grow excited,
i dance around, hoping that i do not break it
hope that do not destroy this beauty
or seven years of bad luck will befall me,
but if i do not dance with it,
i also fear that it will no longer want me
it may betray and leave me lost once again,
Lost.....
