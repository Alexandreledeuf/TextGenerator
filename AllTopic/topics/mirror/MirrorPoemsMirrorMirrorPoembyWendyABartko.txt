Mirror, Mirror on the wall
Will i take that fall
Should i try or would it b better 2 say good-bye
Mirror, Mirror on the wall
I don't think i like who i c at all
I c a tear streaked face, and someone who wants so many
things 2 take place
Mirror, Mirror what is fair
Y do i even care
I should just walk away and save the pain 4 another day
Mirror, Mirror set me free
Let me become the person i long 2 b
Mirror, Mirror on the wall
I want 2 become strong and stand tall
Help me if u can, try and lend me a hand
