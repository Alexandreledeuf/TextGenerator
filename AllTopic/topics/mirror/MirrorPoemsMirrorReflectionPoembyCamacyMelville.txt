When I look in the mirror, what do I see?
A beautiful human being staring right back at me
When I  move grade to grade, what has been shown?
my smartness and how much my progress has grown
When I read a book, cover to cover
I always go back to get another
Some may ask, how do I dress
I may answer, I dress to impress
When I go out I present myself with pride
you can tell by the way I walk, stride for stride
When you look in the mirror, what do you see?
I see a beautiful human being staring right back at me
