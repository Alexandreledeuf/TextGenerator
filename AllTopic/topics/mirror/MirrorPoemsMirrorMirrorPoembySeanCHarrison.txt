Once again she stands motionless
Her eyes searching for something...
Something of beauty she can hold;
Everyday searching, too many times told it's not there.
So she, lost in that eternal stare
Peruses the fine lines, the brows, the cheeks.
But what she seeks is not found in a reflection.
She needs a stare deeper within
Where the ugliness lies snug
In a lack of hugs and affirming words;
A bonafide love for the awkwardness,
The less than perfect nose and the cheekbones not so high,
The words that don't come out quite right.
For the mirror is a terror to a dissatisfied, unsettled heart
That cannot see beauty beyond the physical glare.
She must learn one day to search much deeper there
Where she'll see contentment smiling,
Finally understanding this is the purest
Prettiest reflection ever known and ever shown.
