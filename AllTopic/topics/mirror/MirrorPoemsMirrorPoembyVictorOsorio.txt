Would you trade places?
To live my life
To be me
To feel my pain
Would you ignore a friend?
Move on in life
Pretend not to know
Would you not enjoy music?
Knowing that you love it
But, not wanting to listen
Would you talk to me?
Knowing that I'm a loser
Knowing that I'm ugly
Knowing that I'm a nice guy
Would you take your own life?
Would you finally do it?
Would you start over?
Not knowing how
Stop staring at me
I'll go away from the mirror now.
