When you look in the mirror
What do you see.
A reflection of yourself
or the opposite of thee.
Someone who finds fault
in the decisions that you make.
Who thinks that you're the imposter,
that you're the fake.
.
How do they deal with
the problems that you face.
Do they do it with
better logic and grace.
Or do they just ignore them and make light of it.
Bury their  head in the
sand and end up in the shit.
It leads me to think of Frosts 'The Road not taken'
When the morning comes and I awaken.
But who knows what way the future roads lay.
I am who I am, come what may.
