I'm looking in my mirror
Theres a girl in there tonight
Shes breaking apart so quickly
And nothing can make it alright
Her eyes are red and swollen
Mascara bleeding down her face
She'll never let them know
That shes feeling out of place
She asks
'Mirror mirror on the wall
Who is
The biggest fool of all'
Maybe its the girl
Crying her life away
Or maybe its the boy
Who's mind has been lead astray
Theres this girl in my mirror
With tears she can no longer hide
She can't pretend any longer
Because nothing is alright
