My reflection stares back from the broken mirror
Distorted pieces staring from shards of broken mirror
Wondering where these false images come from
Iâ€™ve lost myself deeply inside this broken mirror
Disillusioned with myself, finally seeing the truth
That hides within shattered images of broken mirror
One thousand eyes blink, with lies behind each one
Cast at me from the remnants of the broken mirror
Crooked smiles endlessly reflecting back in sadness
Captured is the deep despair by this broken mirror
Scattered about the floor inside each silver shard
My self has been captured into this broken mirror
