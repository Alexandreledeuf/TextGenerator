Mirror Mirror
On the wall
Iâ€™m telling you  my secrets
Once and for all
I really want you to see
The other side of me
Not my appearance
Somewhere behind the looks
I want you to know
That you know how I feel
You show me my expression
Everything is true
You never lie
Like most people do
Mirror Mirror
On the wall
I have no secrets
Because you know them all
