_girl in my mirror_
I look at myself in the mirror today
But i cant recognize my face
It wasnt me anymore
This is not what i used to be
I asked my reflection,
who are you?
what have you done to me?
where's the old me?
to my surprise,
the image of the girl talk back
i am you..
i am what you've become..
do you remember?
how much hurt you kept inside?
you look so lonely
your eyes so sad
your skin looks old and dull
because you now dont know
how to give a smile..
you're lying.. Can't you see?
I always have good friends beside me..
A family to care and support
to give me warm hugs and comfort..
what else would i want?
you're the one whose lying? !
are you listening to yourself?
she talk back at me..
'who do you call friends? !
the same people who gives you a cold heart
a broken soul, those who ignore your presence? !
are they real? where are they when u need them? !
you fall apart alone? ! yeah, you've tried all your best,
just to make them happy,
you've given everything
you even scarifice yourself even if it means
that you have to give up something..
who do you call your family?
those who treated you as if they own your life?
telling you what to do?
who laughs at you when you try to express yourself?
those who think you're weak and always sick?
a sister who keep on mocking you?
and brothers who never respect you?
now tell me.. who's lying?
is it me or you? !
now.. do you know who i am?
do you remember my name?
I'm your alter-ego
stop pretending..
dont pretend your happy when ur not
now is the time to make them listen
be not afraid anymore..
stand up and fight for yourself..
and you will see..
that i am you..
and that you are me..
we're one soul..
yours is broken..
mine isnt..
