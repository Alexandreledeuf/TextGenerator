Who is this aging woman I see in the mirror?
Who is this woman with the tear filled eyes?
Who is this woman with the broken heart?
Who is she? Is it Me?
Have I changed so much?
Has time torn apart, my happier heart?
Has time changed the skies,
from blue to grey?
Has time turned the
pain of night also to the day?
Has time worn a hole,
into the cloth of my life,
into the marrow of my soul?
Where did it go, That happy life?
Who made my soul feel this pain,
feel this strife?
Who is this woman
with the tear stained face?
She lost her heart pain took its place!
Who is this woman?
