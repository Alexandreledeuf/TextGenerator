Rainfall, lightning, thunder, sun
Condense gems which ocean shun
Greetings geese, planes goodbye
Friends I loved, friends they fly.
Waves connected, big and small
Sheet of glass where sapphires fall
Sapphires blue, then red, then black
Beams of white, the mirror cracks.
Silver lining in between
Something only few have seen
Horizon marks the bounds of map
The bounds of dream of which I nap.
Mirror, mirror, of the sky
Sea of which you go by
I row my boat forevermore
To find the non-existing shore.
