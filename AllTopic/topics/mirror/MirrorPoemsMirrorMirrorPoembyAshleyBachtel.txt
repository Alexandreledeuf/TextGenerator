They say that mirrors are gateways to a parallel universe
and I think this may be true
because although we look alike, I am nothing like you.
I wish you could be the mother that you used to be
instead of being with that man, you're dirt beneath his feet
The saddest part is what could have been
You could have been my closest friend
You could have been the greatest mom
all if you had just stayed strong.
You used to be so beautiful
Now youre skin and bone
Your voice is thick with toxins, I can hear it on the phone.
You'd be so proud if you actually cared
if you made the right choices and were actually there
I won; t blame myself anymore
And I'm done staring at the door
Just waiting for you to come back changed
to have your priorities rearranged.
In a world where you put your children first
is a world where my brother and I wouldn't have to hurt
And I worry every single day
that I'll lose my grip and become that way
But then I know its just a thought
I would never give up after how long I've fought
I don't want to end up like you
and I wont. I refuse.
Do you even know how much I've cried?
Over the hate and of the lies?
My mirror, mirror sets me free.
I'll never be like you
but forever will be me.
