O, human love is brittle as a glass!
And breaks into pieces, you cannot glue,
Enticing people’s hearts, until they pass;
Succeeding in the hands of just a few!
You ought to handle it with supreme care,
Lest accidentally it falls and breaks;
Most times, it shows that life is still unfair,
Or mountains out of mole-hills, surely makes.
Sometimes, the silvering may much peel off,
Reflecting faces as weird as can be;
Sometimes, it makes you laugh or cry or scoff,
And shows that life can turn at times nasty.
Lucky are some to witness love life-long!
For most others, ’tis just a dainty song.
