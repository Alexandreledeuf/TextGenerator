When I pass a mirror
and catch you watching me,
I'm stricken with the strangest chill
that no one else can see.
The resemblance is uncanny.
The face, the hair, the nose.
I'm even just about your height.
I guess that's how it goes.
I'll always be reminded
of when you went away
each time I pass a mirror...
(That's every single day.)
