Mirror, Mirror on the wall,
I look into every day, but now I see someone I don't know at all!
When I was young,
I remebered,
I would look for hours.
Now, as I grow older,
My face appears as ugly and dry as wilted flowers.
My wrinkles grow longer
And I spend much less
Time in front of you,
When I do,
I'm so blue.
You see, you can really tell I'm not as much of a Man as I once was,
It is hard to say,
But a plain fact,
As our body's fall apart,
We fight back.
We fight back with dyes, creams and powders,
Even some try selective operations to retard age,
Oh how wise is such a sage.
If the desired result it stop the process,
Who among us willing to start.
What is would take is implied consent,
You must give in and lament.
You no longer must linger,
Where you once did,
And if you do,
You can make a bet
That this too will be a great lament.
