‘ All this I will give you, ’  he said, ‘ If you will bow down and worship me.’ (Mt.4: 10)
Mirror, my mirror!
My  self- made  image God!
It is  you I adore!
Selfishness has built an inner altar in my heart.
To you my ego, I deserve the best of me!
I promise not to question who I am,
As long  as  I walk in the red carpet,
A little money to my character is a big deal.
I was told  souls have no price,
So, it is just my  body, just bone and flesh.
Wholesale! Big savings!
My body, my sanctuary!
My image  at sale!
Nothing to do with me.
Don´t you see?  I am   a celebrity, brother!
Behold! How   fit I am  … and skilful!
I devote to you   everything I am.
Untill no more of me will be seen  - a rebirth -! The ‘  superme ‘!
Stardom is the paradise where  my soul will  rest.
My heaven  right  below my feet:
A star on the walk of fame,
A fallen  bright star!
Come see me! Watch me! I am  At your disposal!
My image … my body, my eyes, my hair, my beauty:
A corpse.
