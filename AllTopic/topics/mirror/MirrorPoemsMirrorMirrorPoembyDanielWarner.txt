Mirror, mirror on the wall...
Who will be ready to catch her when she falls...
Mirror mirror you see im not big nor tall...
But tell me please, tell me I can be her all...
Mirror, mirror I resemble pitiness you say...
But I've learned to accept and thank anyway...
Mirror, mirror cant you see...
I don't think I can be what she wants me to be...
Mirror, mirror with your reflection so dim...
Why must I fault, why must I sin?
Mirror, mirror with you being so precise...
Can you spare me some knowledge, lend me some wise?
Mirror, mirror I love your recognition...
But please let this noose end me with submission...
