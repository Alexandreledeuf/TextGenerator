Mirror Mirror Don’t You Think
Mirror mirror on the wall
Don’t you ever think?
When I wash in the bathroom sink
That I want to be alone but all I see
Is the mirror reflection of me
Copying my ever move
Staring at me just to prove
I’m alive at the most
Ah you’re so wrong for I’m a ghost
So for your wrong detection
I should show no reflection
So being the good ghost I am
I will let you off with a little crack
An if you do it again I will be back
With a hammer attack!
