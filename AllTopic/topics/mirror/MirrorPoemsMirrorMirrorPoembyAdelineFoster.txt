Mirror, Mirror on the wall,
Will I ever be as tall
As my mom and dad today-
Or will I always be this way?
When I wish so much to grow
And know the things that adults know,
Mirror, Mirror on the wall,
Must I always be this small?
Little girl or little boy-
Quaint questions these to ask a toy-
No mater how you hope or pray
You can not stop a single day.
As water drops fill up a cup,
The days pass by and you're grown-up.
Little girl or little boy,
You'll soon out grow this simple toy.
Mirror, Mirror on the wall,
Why do adults have the gall
To pat my head and say to me:
What do you think that you will be?
There are so many things to do;
Why must I choose just one or two?
Mirror, Mirror on the wall,
Why can I not choose them all?
Little boy or little girl,
Yes, this is a busy world.
There are many things to do,
And all of them are awaiting you.
You must learn a bit of each
Then pick the best ones in your reach.
Little boy or little girl,
You can build a better world.
Mirror, Mirror in my hand,
You are so hard to understand;
You sometimes laugh and sometimes frown,
And if I want I'll turn you â€˜round.
Upside-down and sideways too,
I do as I please with you.
Mirror, Mirror in my hand,
Top that one if you can.
