Every time “I” see people…,
“I” feel great! “I” feel happy!
“I” feel happy to be with them!
“I” can see many people with many difference characters!
When they feel sad,
“I” will feel the same...
When they are laughing,
“I” will laugh too…
But now,
“I” only a pieces of an ugly mirror,
All “my” beauty has change!
“I” can see them anymore!
“I” am alone now!
Crying alone,
