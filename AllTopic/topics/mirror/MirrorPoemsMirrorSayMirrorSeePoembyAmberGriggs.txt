Mirror say Mirror see
Tell me what you see in me?
For what I see is a girl
She moves identical to me
But the girl in the mirror is nothing like me
She has no glow,
The glow that every girl needs
I see no beauty,
A plain Jane
Mirror say Mirror See
Tell me what you see in me?
What I See is not me
She has no hope in those little eyes
For she has seen too much
I see a girl who is not me
She does not smile
For her lips has spoken lies
Mirror say Mirror see
Tell me what you see in me?
Who is this girl in front of me?
For what I see is couldnâ€™t be
Her skin is not perfect
For she has to many scars
She has been through too much
The girl in front of me is not the beauty I need
No, she is no Barbie
But a Rag Doll drug through life
Mirror say Mirror see
Is that really me?
I am no beauty
For I was never a gift
But a girl with a dream
Mirror say Mirror see
Will that ever be me?
