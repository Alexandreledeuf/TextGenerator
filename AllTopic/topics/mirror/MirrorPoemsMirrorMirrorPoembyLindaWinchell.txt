Mirror, mirror on the wall
Compliment ME... most of all!
Tell me I’m pretty…tell me I’m great
Don’t hold back your compliments
Don’t hesitate.
Some call me… too vane
Some call me… stuck up.
Some envy me…I know
Wising they had such... good look luck.
Mirror, Mirror what was that you’ve said?
You say that I’m ugly inside...and that my insides are dead?
How can that be mirror...am I not the prettiest of all?
Mirror, oh mirror… upon my wall.
Tell me do…tell me what I wish so to hear.
Tell me those other comments…are wrong to my ears.
“Pretty is as Pretty does” but these things you clearly lack
For ones beauty lie deep... within ones heart to view
And yours my dear maiden… have none of that.
