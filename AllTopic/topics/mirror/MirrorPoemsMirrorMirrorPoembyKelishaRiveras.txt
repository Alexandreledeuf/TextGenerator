When I look into the mirror I'm afraid of what I see
I'm afraid of the person staring back at me
I'm frightened that the person will take over who I am inside
So instead of facing my biggest fears I run and I hide
But I stop and ask myself 'how can this be'?
The mirror can only reflect the person looking - which is me
I found out what I'm afraid of and it's not the mirror
Its really actually me that I fear
