Who's that girl there I see?
She's looking back at me.
I see she's not happy but
Don't know why, who is she?
I see her here every day,
I think she's lost her way
But no one will venture to
Help because she won't say.
Nobody else sees the tears,
The lying smile hides her fears;
The confusion screaming in
Her head no one else hears.
I leave her then, go to bed,
Lie down and pray in my head,
There's nothing more I can do
Send some help' I said.
He was watching, he knew,
He always knows what to do.
I feel Him say through the night,
'Don't worry, I love you! '
I awake feeling his grace,
I see her in the same place,
But something is different,
A real smile's on her face.
