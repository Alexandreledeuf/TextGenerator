Noticed I was all alone today
But realized I never felt alone
Now I can log on the computer
Instead of going for the phone
It's wonderful when people visit
And I love my phone calls too
But now I have this special place
To come and visit with all of you
I can take the extra time in here
To say it with a poem or rhyme
To sit and think what's in my soul
Where I am not hurried for time
Things I would never say in person
For it's easier to say in written words
Because you my internet friends
Have heard what no one else has heard
I can come to you with anything
No matter how silly, real or unreal
You're always there to show you care
And just let me express how I feel
It seems it is easier to talk to you
Than with any one else that I know
For I can let my guard down here
And let all of my emotions show
So I thank you all for being here
And I count you as treasured friends
I hope I will always be here for you
And I pray this kinship never ends
