I'm burning all my bridges and I'm running out of time
If I'd had just one more minute I could have somehow made you mine,
But as it is, im broken and im falling to the ground,
Im weightless, empty, and nothing I say makes a sound.
Baby please tell me that you want me so maybe this writers block will ease.
There was a time I would have told you that without you i cant breathe.
Oh but darling my ego is fragile and its only getting worse.
These easy words and my cruel detachment is my long suffered curse
