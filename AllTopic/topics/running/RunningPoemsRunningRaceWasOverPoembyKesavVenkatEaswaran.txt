Running race was over;
Rabbit was musing hard
How come he lost to her?
Shameful and sad; so bad
As outside darkness spread
From inside of his heart,
He met her in her nest;
Asked how she managed that
Tortoise smiled and said:
Over those drinks you had,
Inside those pumping talks,
Last night two pills I packed!
