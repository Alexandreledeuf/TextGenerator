She's shallow and easily programmed.
And maybe that has something to do
With the size of the state she represents.
And that's not sexist at all.
When it comes to speaking about issues, facts and truths...
Her eyes aren't as focused.
In fact...
There seems to be deception hidden behind them!
As they seem to be when she repeats her beefed up resum√©.
Making her the obvious choice he could have made,
As a running mate!
Moderate or conservative...
Or whatever those folks call themselves today.
'Right wingers who aren't liberal.
You know...
Those who pack guns, hunt and race cars.
And talk about how patriotic they are.
With isolated values,
They insist should be everyone's standard for life.'
