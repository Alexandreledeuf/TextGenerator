In thunderstorm, and a grey dog
A dog always tied, and in chain
But in thunderstorm, roaring
The dog is running, struck by fear
Enters the room, and under the bed
Pushes himself, places his head on his claws
The grey skin and fur of the dog
Keeper of the house, and near the door
A shepherd hound, loyal to the house
Men and women, children and animals
The dogs tail, cut but still long
And ears straight, eyes dark
I remember the dog, a friend old
When I was a child, and the village simple
My verse is simple, as simple as dog
I wish I had a dog like him, a friend of worth
The many things I mourn and the dayâ€™s happenings
But today, my dog I mourn you and remember you
