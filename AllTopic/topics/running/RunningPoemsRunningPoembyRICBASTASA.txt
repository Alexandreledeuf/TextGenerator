running away
like a cat
trying to
catch its
own tail,
keep on running
try catching
a shadow
keep on running
sweat out
the feeling of
air and breeze
and smoke and fog
all whipped up
by this wind
keep running
pursue the reasons
why one must keep running
does it really help
you cope up
with what you are leaving?
