Dr. Death, aka Jack Kevorkian, is running for congress,
He is running for the 9th District seat in Michigan,
The incumbent Republican,
Joe Knollenberg to unseat
Jack is 79, and he looks like death warmed over,
He’ll be lucky to make to November,
He has to have 3,000 signatures for his name to be put on the ballot,
To bad he assisted suicides in many of his supporters,
-at least 130 of them.
His lawyer, Mayer Morganroth, is mum on the word,
His previous lawyer, Geoffery Feiger,
Argued that the society did not have The Knack to follow Dr. Death’s thinking.
They Shoot Horses Don’t They?
Was the contention.
Maybe he can assist the Democratic Party its fray,
To lead to a new direction.
They seem destined for a self destruct convention.
