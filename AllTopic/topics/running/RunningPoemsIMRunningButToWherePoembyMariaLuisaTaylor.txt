Running, running
There is nothing lef to do.
Running...
Away from my tears
Away from my pen
Running to know who I,
am.
Running
But you, don't know what,
You're,
Running from.
Running in circles
Going nowhere.
I'm saying Goodbye
I am runnning away.
Never stop runnning
Words running throught,
My mind.
Running away,
Like the coward,
Like him
Horrible words
I am running and runnning,
For you.
I m running but to where?
I can't believe
That I've put up with you lies.
Im running from the past..
Running out the pain.
Running with out you.
