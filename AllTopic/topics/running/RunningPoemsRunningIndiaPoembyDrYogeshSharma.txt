A shaky hand on the horn,
Other on the gear.
A ear listening music,
Cell phone in the other ear.
A trembling foot on accelerator,
Other on the clutch,
Unsettled mind and clumsy eyes,
On scantily clad girls.
Welcome to a fast running nation,
Driven by fools and jokers,
On bumpy and dumpy roads,
Pulling the nation for untimely doom.
Sick, secular, tottering leaders,
Salute this deceitful spirit,
Welcome to a nation minus nationalism,
This is the wonder that is India.
