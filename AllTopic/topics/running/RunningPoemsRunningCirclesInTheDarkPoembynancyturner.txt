running circles in the dark
wanting nothing but the pain to stop
wishing my life would depart
i scream but no one hears me
like no one can see
wishing some one could try and help me
but no one likes me
so how can they try and love me
i mean who esle can i be
so ill stay here forever
running circles in the dark
with my life falling apart
im in a place where the pain will never stop
running circles in the dark
