Deciding to come out of hiding,
To run away...
From what's inside,
Kept still denied.
But then...
Why does one keep believing,
Running from something...
Frees.
Deciding to come out of hiding,
To run away...
From what's inside,
Kept still denied.
But then...
Why does one keep believing,
Running from something...
Frees.
So many do it thinking...
Running from something frees.
And keep a pace believed...
A running from something frees.
To only feel defeated,
By a running with no relief.
So many do it thinking...
Running from something frees.
And keep a pace believed...
A running from something frees.
To only feel defeated,
By a running with no relief.

It's hard to stop it but...
A running away doesn't free.
Those who have stop it know...
A running away doesn't free.
Believe or not...
Whatever isn't dropped,
Will continue to come knocking.
Oh....
A running away doesn't free.

No. No. No...
A running away doesn't free.
There is no doubt about it...
Running away doesn't free.
