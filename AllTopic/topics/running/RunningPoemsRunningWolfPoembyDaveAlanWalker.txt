In my dream
I dream I am you
running wolf
As you run through
the valleys of truth
I see the dew
I see the trees
as though I am you
I see through your eyes
I feel your fears
I feel your heart beating
I see indians dancing
round fires of peace
I see the fears
of what the white man brings
I see peace and harmony
and a place for me
Running wolf
one of truth
why is there a place for me
Because my light and soul
I am the reincarnation of you
