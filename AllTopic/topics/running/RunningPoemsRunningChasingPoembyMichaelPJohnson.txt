The world we know is far from free
Her children live in fear
We’ve lost The Truth and fail to see
The reason why we’re here
We’re running here we’re chasing there
Searching both night and day
Whilst God has Heaven’s wealth to share
With those who Christ obey
But who can see the facts displayed
Or hear The Master’s voice
Why is the heart and soul dismayed
When darkness stays our choice
Like fools we choose satanic wares
Through lust we seek self-gain
When trapped within life’s evil snares
We let the devil reign
So now God’s voice is seldom heard
Where lies have filled the mind
We listen to our neighbour’s word
Who self is lost and blind
Not always is it Satan’s blame
As in the past believed
We choose ourselves a life of shame
Claiming we were deceived
No liar’s reach The Promised Land
No sin from God can hide
We need The Truth to understand
Why Jesus came and died
We must repent from walking dead
Return to life once more
Rise up from Satan’s lustful bed
And lock to him our door
