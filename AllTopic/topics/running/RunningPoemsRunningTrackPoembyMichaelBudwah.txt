Running in a race,
But not the same past,
I wish i could go faster,
But my body wont let me,
Like im tied in chains,
And the pain is to insane,
Running till I fly,
But my wings wont let me,
Like a bird with dislodged wings,
Running In Place,
Even Though Im Comming In Late,
And I bit to much on the plate.
