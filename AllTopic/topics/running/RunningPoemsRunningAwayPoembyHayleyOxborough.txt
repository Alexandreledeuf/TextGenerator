I considered running away today,
To leave all my worries behind,
I considered running away today,
Then I changd my mind.
I thought about running away today,
How could I get there fast?
I thought about running away today,
That plan didnt last.
I am going to run away today,
I've had enough of my life here,
Packed my bags to run away today,
Didn't go because of fear.
I got up and ran away today,
Jumped on a train to Waterloo,
But while I was away today,
I realised I missed you.
I wont be coming home today,
I'm starting my life new
Even though I wont be home today,
Remember, I love you!
