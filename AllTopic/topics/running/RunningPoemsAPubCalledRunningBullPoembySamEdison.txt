After 15 shots of whiskey I puked right on the floor
Asked the bartender for another he said dont come back no more
And then the mutant bouncers they grabbed me off my feet
I barely put up a struggle as they threw me out onto the street
Threw a rock right at there window and vomited once more
I stumbled fell and crawled untill I bumped into this whore
She said now sugar you dont look so good would you like to see my pink
I said well maybe later but for now I need something to drink
She pointed in the direction of a pub called running bull
They'll pump you up with whiskey till your livers completely full
With a prayer up to Saint Mary I made it miraculosly to the door
And when that door had opened I seen something Ive never seen before
I seen angels devils and lizards sharing bottles and singing song
Each and every bottle was a Jameson so I knew that I belong
I ordered a shot of Jameson the shot glass was as big as my head
I asked if I died and went to heaven they said no son your not dead
You had made it to your new favorite pub a place called running bull
The only pub in new york city that will have your liver full
