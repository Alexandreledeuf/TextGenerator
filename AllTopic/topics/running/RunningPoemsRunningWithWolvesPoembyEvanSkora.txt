Trapped in submission,
Sumberged in this condition,
Trapped in a shell,
I wish I could quell.
To be free is a dream,
To have what I desire is a wish.
Where can I go,
Where will this path lead,
From this shell I'll never grow,
From this body I won't stop to bleed.
Running with wolves,
An impossible dream,
A most wanted wish.
This shell hiding the beast inside,
I walk in skin,
He talks to me as a guide,
He is my friend, my opposite, my twin.
For him to break free,
What a day that would be,
Until...I abide,
Always there yet he hides inside.
The burning sensation,
To howl,
To run,
To feel the fascination.
Though I feel no fur,
Scratch no claws,
Run no forest,
Howl no song.
My dreams keep me in fascination,
They drive the sensation,
The wolf inside keeps me alive,
The running of the wolves makes me thrive.
