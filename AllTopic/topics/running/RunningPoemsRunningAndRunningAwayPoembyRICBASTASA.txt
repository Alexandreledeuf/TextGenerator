running away
from honesty
not touching
anything
not touched too
by anyone
you keep on
running and
running away?
no one is reached
no one reaches
for you
you keep on running
and running away
from no one
but yourself because
what you touch
bites you
and what you love
is always a stone
thrown at you
and so you keep on
running and running away
from honesty
and having gained speed
you have become the
fastest lie
that even the winds of
the northern seas
cannot catch even
a glimpse of
who you are.
