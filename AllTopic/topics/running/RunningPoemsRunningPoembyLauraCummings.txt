Running away from adulthood,
Being chased by points of authority,
Not understanding,
Still seeing and hearing to much for innocent eyes,
Running away from adulthood,
Being rushed, being pushed into adulthood,
I dont feel ready,
Being chased by points of authority,
I dont know what I'm thinking,
I have no plan,
No organisation,
No hope,
Im just running away from adulthood,
Doing anything to push back the moment when,
I have to grow up,
I dont feel ready,
Being watched by over observant eyes,
Waiting for my ultimate slip up,
The slip that will give reality leave to,
Kick me in the teeth,
Nothing has changed,
I falter,
I fall,
As you can see,
Nothings changed at all,
I run from adulthood,
i get chased by points of authority,
Getting rushed, getting pushed into adulthood,
Being forced to 'grow up! '
Im not ready,
I dont want to take this step,
Its much to big,
And yet,
When i am being over parented,
Trapped by points of authority,
Trapped in situations that i cant be bothered with,
I welcome adulthood with open arms,
But im still not ready.
