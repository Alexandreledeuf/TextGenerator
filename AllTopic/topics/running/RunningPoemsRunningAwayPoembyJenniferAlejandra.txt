Running away
That's what I'll do
Run away,
Away from you
I'll run a million miles
And sail the ocean blue
I'll do anything
To get Away from you
I'll battle a rattle snake
I'll stab it with this stake
I'll do whatever it takes
I'll be out on the street
With nothing to eat
I'll end up probably dead
With an injury on my head
It doesn't matter Because You'll be
Far away from me
