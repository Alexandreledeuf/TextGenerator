Forever through the darkness.
Wind whipping like pain through your heart,
Unable to stand, unable to sit.
You keep running on and on and on.
Silent footsteps trace your route
Through the darkness you're running on foot.
SIlently floating the followers are.
They know why you're running and they know where you are.
You've ran so far
Yet you've ran so little.
You'll never escape so don't even try.
The followers know where your planning to hide.
Bury them deep but they will come back.
The longer you ignore them the harder they'll track;
Along the roads to follow you,
Floating around you in everything you do.
Yet I'm still running in the darkness
Running through the night.
Running out the pain
Running without a light.
