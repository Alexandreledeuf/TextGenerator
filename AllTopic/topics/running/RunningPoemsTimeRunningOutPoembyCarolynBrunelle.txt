Time is running out.
Racing bargain hunters
rush through it, erasing
its quiet joys of reflection.
The seasonâ€™s moments lost
in an ever changing climate,
fade into the familiar abyss.
What now and what is this,
a new year that offers
more of the same
or a breath of fresh air?
Exhaling at last...
I dare to breathe.
