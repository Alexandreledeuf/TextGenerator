I run
Barefoot and cold
Wanting to go where nobody has ever gone
To the moon or maybe even the stars
They all seem so far
But I'll find the right Place
Where I'll sit and wait
And hope and pray
That all these bad thoughts will go away
But I highly doubt it,
Because these memories are here to stay,
Untill they go black and fade away
