I'm running out of time
I'm as low as i can get.
I'm running out of time
No-ones noticed yet!
I'm running out of time
To face my fears and lies.
I'm running out of time
To say all my goodbyes.
I'm running out of time
To tell him how i feel.
I'm running out of time
This love, it makes me ill.
I'm running out of time
To achieve something in my life.
I'm running out of time
To be a mother or a wife.
I'm running out of time
I cant trust anymore.
I'm running out of time
I'm now running out the door! ! !
