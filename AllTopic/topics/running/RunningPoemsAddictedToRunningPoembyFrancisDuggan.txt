At least he's not causing pollution of him that would be fair to say
He runs to the work yard in the morning and back home at the end of the day
A distance of some twelve kilometres that is six kilometres each way
A fitness fanatic and a hard working fellow for him never an easy pay.
Wearing running road shoes and shorts and a light vest he carries his working gear in his backpack
He runs to the work yard every morning and after work to home runs back
A man in his thirties with a wife and teenage daughters he is a few years past his prime
He never does work at the weekends and he never does work overtime.
One who has run in many marathons and he always finishes his race
his last marathon was his best finish just beaten by the winner into second place
Still he is one I do not envy and him I've no wish to emulate
I could not push myself like he does I have no desire to be great.
Just before daybreak in the morning he is one you are bound to meet
He runs to his workplace in the Suburbs on the sidewalk from street to street
To running he does seem addicted he works hard and he runs every day
Whilst others in their their beds are sleeping through the suburbs to works he jogs his way.
