Shadows are running around
In every beat and pleasure
Something might there be found
That you'd consider to erasure
Steps are surrounding the past
With what we did never give

With every known passion inside
Loneliness to feelings calling
Where every doubt must hide
Who goes there in my dream?
Giving no touch of their own
In twilight these days seem
Dim shallow moods their gown
Pass this away from my instance
Give me daybreak to know
There is always a second chance
Come to me herewith and grow
