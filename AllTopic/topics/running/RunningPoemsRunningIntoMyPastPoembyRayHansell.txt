I saw an ole familiar face
My heart beat very fast
Soon our eyes met each other
We were both back in the past
It was many years ago
When we were young and free
I though the sun rose in her eyes
She though she was in love with me
We were so very happy
Together doing our thing
Bothering with no one else
Just reading the I Ching
But as the years passed us
We both moved on
Each going our own way
The feelings were long gone
I hadn’t thought of her in years
But now she stands before me
The days and years that have gone by
Have helped to make me see
We passed the time with small talk
But soon it was time to leave
What I once wanted so badly
Turned out to be what I didn’t need
