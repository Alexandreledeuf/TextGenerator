Without even a by -your –leave
the Future came in
sat down & grinned: “Right...
I’m here...now where do we begin.? ”
“Whowhatwherewhyhow! ”
I positively blustered.
“Stop blustering you idiot! You’re beginning to spit!
& as for this certain IT...you’ve been waiting for
...it’s already begun to happen...hasn’t it?
Now, just get on with it! ”
Who was I to argue?
I was only the Past Imperfect
with nothing but the Present
to stand up in
and this was
...the Future Tense.
The Future smiled at me
as if it were...one step
ahead of me
all the time.
and I stumbled after it
trying to keep up
in its belief in me.
“I guess it’s Time! ”
The Future said
& lead me to myself.
“Well, get on with it! ”
