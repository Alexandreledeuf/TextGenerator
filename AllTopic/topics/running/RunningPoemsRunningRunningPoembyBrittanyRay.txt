Running Running
away from my tears
away from my pain
away from my fears
away from my shame
away from my peers
Running Running

Ill be your right pair
Rnning Running
i wish i was gay
i wish for that happiness

Running Running

away from my family
away from my past
running running
i am so ashamed
i am so embarrassed
im a bottle of pain
