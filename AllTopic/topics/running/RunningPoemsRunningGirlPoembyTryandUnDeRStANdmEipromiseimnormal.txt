Horrible past
Hoping for a good future
Tears in her eyes
Running to the preacher
Asking for advice in the end gaining none
Shes a fearful polar bear sitting in the sun
Trying to hurry and get on with life
She hates the attention, but loves to tell lies
Tries to make things better
But they only turn out worse
The role she's been playing
Plenty a' times rehearsed
Moot is her thinking
Testy is her soul
This running girl is running trying to find her fairy tale
And everyone is screaming
Wait look back at what you've missed
You've tried to zoom thru life not even pausing for a kiss
You're children are grown
You're husband in a nursing home
You all alone
Afraid to answer the telephone
Scared of love and afraid of being touched
Raped and abused in her past
Told she was worth to none
A running girl who never stop's to see who she has hurt
She never planned out her dreams
Always told she was dirt
Wrinkles in her face
Yet she still thinks she's twenty-one
Running girl stop running
Your shoes cant go on
You always wanted a mother
A father just to hold
A house she'd always stay in
No bags to pack and move
All she ever knew was how to run
She never looked away from her path
Never gazed up at the sun
Her children needed her but she struggled
to make it thru the day
Running girl slow down and listen to what your family has to say
Go see your husband and call your children too
Stop running, running girl
You cant afford another pair of shoes
