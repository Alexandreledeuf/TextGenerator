Time is running out I've heard
2012 fast approaching!
The experts claim that in that year
the earth might be destroyed
by something unknown encroaching.
I wonder what it might be this time?
Seems every year there's something new.
First asteroids from outer space bombarding earth
then destruction by, a man made few!
'No one knows the time or day'
when the earth might become that pile of ash!
It is all stated in Revelations, my dear friend
Placed in the Bible, that chapter written last.
So let 2012, one day roll on in!
there is nothing anyone can do.
But you had better pray, that every soul is saved
and that they're ready for,
two thousand one zero one two?
