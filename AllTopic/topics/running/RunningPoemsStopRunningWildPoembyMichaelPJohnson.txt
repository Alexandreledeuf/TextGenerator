We act so proud we play the fool
We walk as though asleep
Yet bend and often break each rule
The Lord would have us keep
If we were parent of a child
Who plays the worldly clown
Would we reward for running wild?
Or would we wear a frown?
Some think The Lord should spare the rod
Should pity when we cry
But God in truth would not be God
If He’d just watch us die
Our God is Father of us all
He hates to see man fail
It hurts to see His children fall
And burn in Satan’s jail
So God will beat and God will chide
Till truth we’ve come to see
His eyes will wander far and wide
To set His servants free
Our father loves us to a fault
He seeks His children’s cure
He’ll season each proving salt
Until our lives are pure
He’ll spare no woman man or child
He’ll trouble heart and soul
Until we all are reconciled
And made completely whole
Consider it joy tests and trials
Persevere them well
We’ll live to wear eternal smiles
Whilst Satan burns in hell
