Why do I feel this way always
I always wish to be free and to fly away
I try to get away from my captors
But they catch me every time
I run from depression, sadness and grief
But they catch me every time
They won’t let me go
I have no reason to stay with them
To feel them
But they won’t let me go
They hold me so close I can hardly breathe
Sometimes I think to end it so I will be free
But I realize to be free that way is the end
No way I can be free and experience what I want to that way
I always run towards happiness but I hardly ever reach it
Depression won’t let me go
No one can free me
No one notices my chains
One day I will be free from bondage one way or another
