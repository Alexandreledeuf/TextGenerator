2day is 90 days clean and serene,
I'm heading home 2morrow but im scared if you know what i mean...
How will i deal with things?
Ya know the problems that LIFE brings...
What happens when that desire comes back,
Will i ever be able to relax,
I've let my guard down and accepted the fact...
Im weak but im strong,
The past 90 days were hard and long...
But i feel great!
90 days and running...
My mind is focused...im finaly straight!
90 days and running...
I turned my life around, to me this is stunning,
Even though this disease is cunning...
Im 90 days clean,
So its a foot race,
I can look at myself face to face...
90 days and running...
90 days and running...
wish me luck...ill need it
p.s
