Deep as my love runs so runs yours too.
Caught at the point of the centre, our hearts,
Beating deep, retreat further as true
Love and devotion merge. No more apart,
Our souls meld, then reappear, fired as one.
We are the same, identical aims run
Along a joined vein of life. Desires become
Cemented in needs of the other. Some
Days the pulsing of you fills my spirit
With rivers of longing. When will you come
And claim what's your own?  I must inhibit
The joy of that day, but as summer shone
Bright over my clouded life then, so  rain
Your love deep, flood me with sunshine again.
