You can’t always run you know
Ghosts of the past will always fallow
It doesn’t really matter where you go
Just know that they will eat you hollow
You can’t always leave everyone behind
It’s within yourself what you need to find
You may run all day
You could run all night
You can never just say
You don’t put up a fight
I really don’t see why
You live just waiting to die
Where is it you think your doing to?
Far away to start anew
When are these days going to be though?
Take a step back and look at you…
Ho w do you think happiness is made
What do you think trust is?
Is it smoking out and getting laid?
Maybe you’d know if you stayed
To not run and learn to deal
To rest up and have a place to heal
You can’t spend your life running you know
The road ahead is always so long
Past lives aren’t that easy to let go
Don’t run away till your forever gone
