Waiting for a Bus,
it didn't want to come?
'started to cuss! '
then stuck out my thumb.
A lady in a Miniskirt, stopped,
in the front I hopped
She said: The Busses are running late
I just stared, then asked for a date.
She said: 'sure tonight at eight',
I thought, 'great she took the bait'
So after work, I ran home and got ready
breath in, breath out, steady
I then went to my Bus stop,
waiting on the bus to hop
But that's is just my Fate
all the busses are still running late, : -(
