no...
not now
this cant be happening to me
its chasing me
the shadow gets closer
i look into it
i see the red eyes
the horns
i must run
death is after me
its too early
my life has been so short
its only started to get good
ive experienced so little
now i'm at the mercy of this beast
i must escape
i try to run
but my legs tire fast
my will fades
then i trip
i break my shin on a rock
the pain
it burns like if i were thrown into the sun
blood runs from my leg
pours all over the ground
i look back
the beast is still chasing me
i get up
i feel my bones shift inside my leg
it tears my flesh
i fall back down
i can no longer feel half my leg
it only hangs off of a bit of skin
lifelessly
i cant just sit here
the beast is coming
its getting closer
tears running from my cheeks
i fear that this may be it
i feel myself growing weak
but i must continue
i try to crawl
pain surging through my body with every movement
no!
i scrape my chest on a sharp rock
death still charging at me
my wounds pour out even more blood
i cant avoid it
death is racing toward me
i sob in tears
my face covered in scarlet
i lie helplessly
i think over my life
look for a good memory
i try to make my last breath last
but pain is too strong
my chest pain burns with intensity
then somehow
my body bursts into flames
the sky rains fire
my hands burn with rage
i cannot put them out
pain so terrible
i weep at the sight of my wounds
the beast is almost near
my hope fades away
my passions are obliterated
i cant stop the beast
my hands turn to ash
the fire now burns my bones
the fire creeps up my arms
my leg pours out blood
my heart is failing
i lie helplessly
in pain as death creeps up on me
i try to scream
but blood creeps into my throat
and i choke, and cough
i cannot breathe
i turn my head to the side
i see something
i try to focus in
i see a light
a beautiful light
so beautiful
as the beast takes my life
i look upon this beauty in awe
and i feel completed
i am ready...
