Strike me right to the heart...
Why am I feeling so insecure..
Pieces on the wall, start to tear.
puzzle pieces, no longer there.
Thoughts continue to scare..
Is it still there?
If you ask me..
I kno my part is..
I'm feeling like running..
should've started packing..
no more falling..
I stand, watching the time go by..
with every second..
You remain in my mind.
mixed thoughts,
heart starts shaking.
hands trembling..
Eyes resting..
Theres only one..
just one..
no one else..
but you..
insecure with the thoughts that remain..
Feeling like running,
Should've started packing..
But I dont feel like leaving..
For that.. I am staying..
I'll watch it blow up in my face..
I'll watch it rejuvenate..
Whatever it is..
Theres no running away.
