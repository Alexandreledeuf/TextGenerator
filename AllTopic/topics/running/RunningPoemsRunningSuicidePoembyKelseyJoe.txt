A silent tear falls to the ground
She hides in her place, not making a sound.
Grief had invaded her body for years
And now it was time for her to face her fears.
She cut her wrists and covered her eyes
And whispered that today was the day she dies.
She stared at herself through the glass
Then punched the mirror to get rid of her past.
The glass fell softly onto the floor
She stared at her fist then ran out the door.
She ran down the hallway really fast
But she could not run away from her past.
After thinking, she gave up on life
She went to the room and got a knife.
She said her goodbyes as she took one last breath
Then slit her throat deep and the blood surrounded her death.
One thing that girl should have known
Is that she would be dead and alone.
And that you canâ€™t escape death or life,
In that one spot where her blood stays on the knife.
So where there is a silent tear
And where there is blood to shed
She will be there to put their misery
To An End
