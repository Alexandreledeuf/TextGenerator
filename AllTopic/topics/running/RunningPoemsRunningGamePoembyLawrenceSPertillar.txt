Running game.
As if this lame routine
Isn't known or seen,
For what it is!
From one door stop to another
This practice has no depth,
Or sincerety upon its delivery.
It just travels to be played.
Amazing those who watch
Others allowing it to continue,
With supportive encouragement...
And donated loyalty!
There is nothing in it for them at all.
It has become tradition...
And that matters more than substance!
