So much anger is about to surface
So much hate. Toleration is deteriorating. Black soul. No soul
Doing for others while they do nothing for me except take.
I won’t give myself to you. You take me while I slumber
Awake now. In the bathroom I see, know, and feel what was done to me
I can say nothing. This I know. All will say it was “invited”. My fault
Dreams flooded with horrid visions. Words are blurred. Let me be
There is no more that I want to see
There is nowhere left for me to be
In my mind, I’m running away from me
