never stop running
never stop moving forward
even if your friends leave you
helpless and alone
even if you have no place
you can call home
never stop running
your race to success
or wherever you are going
because your race
makes you shine
and keeps you glowing
never stop running
never stop moving forward
even when you suffer a loss
leaving you crying sad
even when you make a mistake
leaving you insanely mad
never stop running
your race to satisfaction
or wherever you may venture
because your race
is a triumphant adventure
that keeps you glowing
never stop running
never stop moving forward
even when you lose your energy
leaving you so very tired
even when you lose your will
to keep running the course
NEVER stop running!
your race to the finish
your race to completion
because your race
is what keeps you going
your race keeps you glowing
