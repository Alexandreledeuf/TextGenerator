Do you ever run?
Run with bare feet
Run against the wind
Run and feel you could fly
Run till your breath’s lost
Do you ever run?
Run carrying your heart
Run to avoid tears falling
Run and doesn’t care where to go
Run till your knees breaking
Do you ever run?
Run with all determination
Run to reach the sky
Run and try to catch the lack of time
Run till everything blurred into one
Do you ever run?
Run from all your fear
Run further away abandoning the world
Run and never turn back again
Run till the darkness swallowing
