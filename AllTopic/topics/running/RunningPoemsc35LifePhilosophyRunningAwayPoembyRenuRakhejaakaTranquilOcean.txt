My soul wants to fly away
Riding on a brilliant ray
To a land of oblivion
Where Im known by no one
Just live my life in peace
No one to hurt no one to please
Away from the complexities
That this life brings to its crease
But then I think why run away
The road does get rough in its way
But it also streteches out in a straight road
It may be long but you do reach your  abode
As long as you dont hurt anyone knowingly
Absorb the ride, its highs and lows in totality
Pain is a part of the road and will make you realize
Feel it, endure it and it will help you rise
