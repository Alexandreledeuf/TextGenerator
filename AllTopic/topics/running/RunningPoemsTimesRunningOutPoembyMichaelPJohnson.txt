As less on earth seek truth above
As fewer people care
So rare becomes fragrance of love
While lust pollutes the air
Lust for silver for gold and jewels
For neighbour’s wares and wives
Lust to serve as Satan’s tools
Cursing and ruining lives
But who has faith enough to hear?
Who’s wise enough to see?
Knowledge enough The Lord to fear
And live by Royal decree
How will Jesus greet His bride?
Faithful wealthy and well
Or will she run and seek to hide?
Down life’s dark road to hell
Just as Adam had done before
As Eve bowed down to shame
We close to God and life our door
Denying Jesus’ name
Denying truth of Heaven’s Seed
Author of life and light
Cultivating satanic weed
Walking in ways contrite
Sinking to depths before unknown
As expert in the shade
Denying still The Royal Throne
Of Him through whom we’re made
Will God forgive who’ve misbehaved?
Each wayward wanton crime
Through Jesus Christ the way’s well paved
Yet only whilst there’s time
