During an open air
production of the DREAM
you pucker up
& whisper
“I suppose a quick Puck
would be out of the question? ”
you snigger.
Never one to disappoint a lady
I acquiesce to her request
(at a loss for words)
I merely murmur:
“Yesssssssssssss! ”
under my breath.
We lose ourselves
in the woods
as Shakespeare’s
words
surround us.
“I come...I come
see how I come! ”
you shout.
“Shhhh...! ”
I say
... trying to be faster than an arrow from a Tartar’s bow.
Once more
lost in words
your hair
full of tell-tale
twigs & grasses
skirt too hastily tucked in knickers
(you a brazen hussey…me a bit Byronic)
we listen enthralled
to our
beating hearts
the course of our
true love
running smooth.
Oh, I’m sure
Mr. Shakespeare
would not have
disapproved!
