running water on the river
despite the boulders
it finds itself its way
to where all the waters meet
in that destination
of everything and everyone
running restless souls
towards the same destination
it is not divergence
it is convergence
it is the oneness of all rivers
of all souls
i run and flow
i become everything and everyone at the end
from this flow on this journey
towards everything and everyone
i am gone i am found i am lost i am the drop
becoming a part of the ocean's universe
