Running away isn't as easy as it seems.
There's no deserted mountain waiting when you come,
no peaceful fountain to drink from.
The stars won't be convenient at night,
they won't lead you down by the river to rest.
The hanging moon won't be fluoresced.
No, running away is no means of escape,
it will only bring you closer to fear and failure.
Those who want to get away from their problems
must never run away, but learn to endure.
