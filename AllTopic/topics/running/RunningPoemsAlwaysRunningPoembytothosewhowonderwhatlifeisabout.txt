Could there be a more perfect reason
for a great guy like you
to possibly like me back
or even love me
to attract people from my outside
and make them run from what
I seem to hold within me
I never seem, to get them to stay
you look at me with wantings eyes
wanting me to let you in
I let you see pieces and letting you think
that you are completly in
but are you?
are you willing to stay when things get roough?
and hold me when things fall apart?
to be there to whipe my tears?
so many questions, so many doughts
will you run like so many befroe?
I love you with all of my heart
do you?
