A Rose is a Rose is a Rose
A Rose will I give to you,
A rose bloomed in an arbor,
Silent garden with ecstatic fume
did give birth to that bloom.
A Rose will be for a Rose,
Timelessness for your love,
With deep sensual sensitivity,
Rose will bloom everyday.
In the morning and night,
In the tired noon and shaky evening,
A Rose will bloom for you,
Will Play with your bosom pouring hue.
A Rose will I pluck from the Hurst,
Without violence the plucking will be,
With tender wing the Rose
will Colour your cheek,
Unbutton the beauty you hide,
Will be garden for your dance.
A rose will I bloom in my soul,
The cloud will pour lurid dew,
A mystic rose for atypical mould.
The Rose for you to bloom
on an arid field,
No conditioning set by norms.
Within my mind the Rose will be
fertile for my gratefulness,
The root will be my pleasure
without reason,
My individual self is the root
for your boughs,
A rose single and pure
will bloom for you.
My soul with song sonorous,
Muse heavenly and silence
rootless will praise you,
Each part of your body
will be a hymn,
No mortal dream can be
to make it earthly,
A Rose is a Rose is a rose.
With my love deeply deep you are
beyond facticity of mind,
a penetrating metaphysic,
A soul never to revert with verbal code.
You are a child always open,
Knows nothing of the mind,
A glittering shadow of the divine
on celestial evening.
Which light from which land
did shower grace on you
to make you delighted?
Which pain from which dream
did make you so pensively mystic?
You are a dream, a walking dream,
On the field covered by light.
Beyond mind I search
and no trace is found,
Only air of your presence makes me
frenzy and soulless,
With soulless eremite will I search you
beyond transcendence and above.
Which light doth guard you from my sight?
Which knowledge deep and occult
bewitching me to chase you,
Lovely trance feed your floral body
and painful love around your ambit
protect your chastity.
As darkness enveloped by darkness
or shadow enveloped by shadow,
You are in the garden of my mind
A dream enveloped by a dream,
Or light too glittering to make
shadow of your sight.
In my meditation you gleam and
like a moving image on the still sea
of my mind or no-mind,
Sometimes joy and sometimes pain,
In my awakening state you live
as painful inspiration to write epical rhyme.
You are a total self,
a blossomed being,
A rose of my heart fully blossomed
can worship your shrine,
In the heart of my being an alter,
Day and night will be humming, My mind,
The humming mind to be one with you,
To eat your light to be you.
A rose born in my soul without thorn
to love you to caress you,
With pain lofty and dainty
will I find a path though pathless,
With the opening of the petals
I will find your heart.
If youthful joy mystify the way,
If passion pass into
the sky of consciousness,
With time and by subsiding the surge
I will find you in the stillness
of my mind.
Like rain I will drop on you
and suck the milk of divine magnesia
Of your being,
In that formless delight
we both are one.
