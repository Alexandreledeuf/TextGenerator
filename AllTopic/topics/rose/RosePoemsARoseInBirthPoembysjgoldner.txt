I'm a disgrace to the life
I lived as a girl—
she would be ashamed
to have me in the world.
But there's no turning back;
it's time to pay the price
for selfish pride
and evil vice.
Or pack up my things
and leave this great earth—
would you put in place
a rose in birth.
Cause thorns I've got
it's the petals I lack;
beauty should unfold:
this is no unknown fact.
With this request I must be going—
please all take care,
boys and girls
handsome and fair.
