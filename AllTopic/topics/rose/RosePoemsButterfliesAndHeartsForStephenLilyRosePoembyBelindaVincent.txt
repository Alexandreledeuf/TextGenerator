Drift upon the breeze
like gentle whispers heard in the wind.
Taking you high through the trees
bringing you down low among the flowers.
You caress my cheek softly, gently.
I feel you, I know you are here.
Fly high my butterfly, fly high
I reach out, touch the velvety softness of your wing,
gracefully you glide into my outstretched hand.
Your wings dancing to the beat of my heart, .
a tender kiss of love for my aching soul.
I feel you, I know you are here.
Fly high my butterfly, fly high
The flight of gossamer dreams
are you, with your wings of yellow and blue.
You are what you seem,
the spirit of my beloved child, so true.
Comforting all who believe.
I feel you, I know you are here.
Fly high my butterfly, fly high
