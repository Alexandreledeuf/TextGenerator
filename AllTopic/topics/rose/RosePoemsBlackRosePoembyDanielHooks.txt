You look like a black rose
in full bloom.
Your pose and the clothes you wear
Make me stare.
I am entranced hypnotised by your glance
Your raven black hair flowing down your back
Your skin porcelain pale gleaming white
Under in the moons pale light
Your lips a black shade of night
Waiting to be kissed
(please don't resist)
I could list all the ways I love thee
and still not get close
Black rose I love you the most.
