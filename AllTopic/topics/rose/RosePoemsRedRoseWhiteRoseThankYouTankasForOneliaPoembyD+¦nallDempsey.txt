A rose made of blood
where the thorn cruelly cuts me
blossoms in my palm.
I, a rose...made of flesh...blood
rivalling thorn's red flower.
*******
Thorn bleeds with my blood
pouring red into white rose
my humanity
unable to change Nature's
design - white rose remain...white.
******
I received the tangled hair...it is beautiful...thank you.
