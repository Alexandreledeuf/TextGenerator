You’re really  fearless and want to hunt
You’re really want to make us to teach
You’re really lover of wild
You’re  really uncaring  it but to learn from it
You’re  really want to teach them.
You really  twisted order of the day
and shatter   mirror of terror
You make  efforts to peace
'Watching. Waiting. Carefully baiting.'
You belong to a brave leaders of the day
To you, it was you  who did it best
For you we learn  wild animal kingdom
You’re not  hide, pridely teach us to protect our pendant head
You’re  not mere  a crocodile hunter
Steve......
Not that filthy breed of reptilian...
A  rose bush   for you....
