When my life one day has gone
And the breath I breathe
From me moves on...
I wonder if you'll want me near?
Or see images of me,
That come and disappear?
Will you wish upon a star...
Love from you would find my heart?
When my life one day has gone
I hope our spirits connect,
Like heat from the Sun on a tree belongs!
