Sun over dark trees;
Sun rising over the black;
Sun and blueness, BLISS!
This day is a special one;
This perfect day, is like A  KISS!
This is another wonderful day!
One Sun, keeps us warm;
One Sun is needed to be;
One Sun will suffice, to see!
Only because of the sun;
Only that prevents our demise;
Only our Sun, maintains us all!
