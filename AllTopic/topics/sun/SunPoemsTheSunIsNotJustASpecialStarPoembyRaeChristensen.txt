The Sun is not just a special star
Huge balls of hot gases are stars spinning in space
So big so hot and giving heat and light to the Earth
Larger than one million Earths is the Shining Sun in front of our face.
We must never look directly at the Sun
Cos it's not fun its brightness will damage the eyes
The Sun gives lives to all creatures on Earth
To all births, animals, human beings n natures when Sun shines
The stars shine all the time day and night
The Sun's so bright, it hides the light of the other stars
With a steady light's broken up as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere
Oh my dear, how beautiful they look, sparkle twinkle little stars.
The Earth spins or rotates on its axis
In geographic, we have...night and day, who wonder how?
The axis is an...imaginary line, going through the centre of the Earth
Taking 24 hours at once for the Earth to spin around.
At night, one side of the Earth moves away from the Sun
That part is the darkness..as the sun seems to sink below
Look at the horizon, the darkness is starting filling the dawn sky
With the rich dark beautiful colours, changing to night time very very slow.
