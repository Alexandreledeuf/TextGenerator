Pink-edged clouds,
sunset sun.
Bedimming light.
New night begun.
Fortell, what new wonders,
have come to pass?
A new child born,
a new blade of grass?
What things anew,
will there be?
New wonders fathomed,
from the life-giving sea?
Hued pink-edged clouds.
Low sunset sun.
Bedim thy light.
Still, you are not done.
Because, for from thy union,
'tis lucid, sure as dawn will be,
that Life blossoms forth,
from your simplicity...
