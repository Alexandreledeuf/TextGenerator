sun goes on shining
while the debbil beats his wife
blues played lefthanded
topsy-turvy inside out
under the weather
down by the sea
a broke johnny walker
mister meaner
bigger than a big man
cirrus as a heart attracts
more power than a loco motive
think your shit don't stink
edge against a wall
wearing your colors
soulfully worn out
stylishly distressed
