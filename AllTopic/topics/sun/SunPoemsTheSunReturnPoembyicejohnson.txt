Where did the sun go?
Somewhere we will never know
Where is the sun?
Did it run away from you and me?
Without it you and I cant see
Sadness now exists
Our nightmares are at our reach
Where is the sun?
Now my days are colder
Will the clouds love forever in my life?
Cause I dont want to live this way
I'll chase the sun if O decided to run
I'll chase the sun but will the sun know it's me
longing to keep
The sun, come back
