staring into the sun
white light
pure essence
the burning love
hypnotic fare
resolute dawn of darkness
the eyes succumb
thirst for pure water
to chill the warm blood
pumping to the charred cornea
essential will
broken by nature
made & broken
seduced by beauty
the danger of vision
i stared in wonder
til i could no more
senses flared
flaming
excruciating joy
the brilliance
incoherent, insolvable
now dead to sense
recoverable only in
the pagan ether of each new dawn
a twinge of soft light
searing the edges
of black vision
& colours remembered
sights seen
unbelievable now.
