Brethrens: Moon, Sun, distant Constellations
Powerful divine universal life forces
In true wonder and thanksgiving I hail
Thee, this morning’s shower of shooting stars
Packaged and dropped in old English’s
Majesty most perfectly graced in
Advent’s hope for a new year filled with
His wonderful gift of interior peace
Wandering soul now navigating star-lit
Celestial corridors, the holy Three
Calling me to their soft luminosity
Sweet Wisdom guiding this itinerant soul
A generous beacon assuring sound
Voyage to their promised new home port
