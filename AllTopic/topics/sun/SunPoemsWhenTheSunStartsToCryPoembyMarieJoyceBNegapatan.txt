There you were
So distant from my life
Yet so near in my eyes
I hear your one special laugh
Yet you're weeping inside
But you're no ordinary soul
Coz you can touch someone's life (with your smile)
I know
You're heart's been badly hurt
But you still shines like the sun
In the sky
Chorus:
I wish that I could be there (and be your friend)
So you don't have to pretend (that you're okay)
if things don't feel alright (never alright)
Just let me be by your side
I'll wipe your tears dry
When the sun starts to cry
You sang a song
So full of emotions
It made everybody cry
But do they know
What lies behind your song
A sad story just like mine
I know
You ain't that strong
As they all know
But still you're here
Just to shine
A light in our sky
(Repeat Chorus)
Bridge:
You were just a stranger
I see everyday
But you gave me that warmth
I rarely feel on people
These days
But why do you need to hide
The rain beneath your clouds
You know, you don't have to pretend
When you're feeling
Down, down, down
So why don't you just look around
(Repeat Chorus)
When the sun starts to cry
(Repeat until fade)
