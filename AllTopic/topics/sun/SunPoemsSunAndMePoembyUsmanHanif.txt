The sun seeking my shadow
My shadow hides behind me
And when i look at mad-show
The sun gazes to blind me
I watch the sun from far
The sun witnesses only earth
Yes something called bar
Seperates me and sun since birth
Yes, i want the sun to merge into me
And i could become illuminated
But sun doth not want to agree
Yes, but moon is also related
To the sun by reflecting light
I am not the moon, i know the truth
Dependance does not give light
But victory always makes bright
But victory isn't gained by fight
A loser can be victorious like me
Yes, i could not face sun's light
and by light; it could never seek me...
