And the sun slept on into the day
and lay buried deep
where the wisemen say
its gone to find some peace.
O hand me this, this tired star
and let it be thrown
with a spiteful toss so far so far
so far from home
Throw it to night and the darkness it craves
hurl it into endless space
watch it as it slowly fades
with an upturned face
O hope O hope you treacherous dawn
that promised light would come again
but you've grown dim and now are gone
Come night my cursed friend
