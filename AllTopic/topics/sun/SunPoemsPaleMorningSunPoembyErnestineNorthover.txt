Pale morning sun that rises in the east,
Spread wide your light,
And let the warming blush be thus increased,
To shine more bright.
Welcome the dawn and so enhance the sky,
With colours that unite,
A vision there displayed, food for the eye,
Quick changing sight.
A new day now unfolds, and in its glow,
The scene is quite
Breathtaking. Subtle shades soft and mellow,
Just fine and right.
Pale morning sun, that rises, burn more strong,
And so invite,
Nature to call awake the melody of birdsong,
From out the night.
