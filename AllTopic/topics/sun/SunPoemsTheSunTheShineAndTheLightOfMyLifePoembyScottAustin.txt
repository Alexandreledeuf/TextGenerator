There is the sun
Who wakes me up for another day
That brightens each and every day
There is shine
Who shines so bright in the evening sky
That keeps me dreaming of better tomorrows
Then there is the light of my life
Who is always there when I am down
That has this gift of lighting the way
Without these three
I could not be
This is the sun, the shine
And the light of my life
This could only be my family
Who always brightens my life
With every passing day
