The sun got up and saw the moon.
'Why  are you out of bed so soon? '
'It is because a moon's required
to light the way when you've retired
into your bed to rest your rays,
I do not like to work on days.'
'I'm glad to see you my dear cheese
to tell you of my ailing knees
and in  the Springtime I will quit
and you can handle all this shit.'
