she dug a hole
planted some seeds
kept them watered
picked away the weeds
soon in time
they started to grow
to her surprise
she had a whole row
she loved her bushes
they grew beautiful and green
admired by all
for miles they could be seen
one day
she fell sick
no more water
no weeds were picked
when she didnt come anymore
the bushes knew
that something was wrong
but they knew what to do
they grew bigger and bigger
stretching for a mile
they had to find her
to just see her smile
one day they stopped growing
they reached this place
knew she was there
just couldnt see her face
one small flower grew
among the miles of green
one beautiful red rose
was to be seen
a symbol of their love
for which they had saved
one red rose
they placed upon her grave
