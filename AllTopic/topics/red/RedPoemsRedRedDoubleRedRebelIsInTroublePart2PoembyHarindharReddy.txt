Fighting is my Label,
I am a red rebel.........
I am in trouble and in double.
From here does my revolution spread.
As I wed blood and a rebellion dead.
I am dying spirit of my fellow comrades.
I am a lover of swords and Marx words.
I spill my blood in the dark deep woods;
Social change is my goal, I'm a tool.
Societal change is my soul, I'm no fool!
If I open my mouth war is not far.
As a child I did not slide on saar.
So far, I know only a war for heaven's sake
I can't sneak like a thief or slither like snake!
Hike! Hike! My life is at stake.
Hello! Hello! Fellow class!
I did not pass, I am mass, ma! Ma! Mass.
Karl Marx, Fredric Angel, Mao is my boss;
Gun is my friend and pen is my property.
I will fight and fight till I create history.
But I died in fowl encounter and under mystery.
Remember my words we cannot be calm,
Keep chanting, “Salaam! Salaam! Comrade lal salaam! ”
You moved heaven and earth bye, bye comrade!
Let me bid you adieu with bon-voyage Comrade!
