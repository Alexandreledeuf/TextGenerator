RED balloon
floating through frames
of Thirties celluloid
dusty RED
dreamtime
black feet dancing
rhode island RED
bustling scratchily
in the poo speckled straw
RED back
hiding in the cupboard
spinning her web
marxist RED
hiding under the bed
spinning in the Fifties
RED shoes
shining, dancing
dancing till death
carmine RED
shining on clowns' noses
audience laughing
RED wine
dancing on drunks' noses
everyone laughing
the RED queen
running faster and faster
growing smaller and smaller
deep RED
roses, richly perfumed
always remind me of you
I LOVE RED
