giving always a happiness to anyone look at you...
or to anyone smell you lovely perfume...
and take off all sadness from the soul...
my red rose you are...
the rose which i love and adore...
the rose which it red bloody as the blood in my heart...
the rose which sleep always with me..
sleep with me on my chest....
miss you my sweet rose...
miss you as the child's` miss to his mama...
miss you as the adorers` miss to his pray...
as the clouds missed to the rain...
miss you so my sweet dream...
miss you and don`t even know why...
when i am so far from you...
you stay in my heart...
you always in my thoughts...
and my body start with shakes...
and the heart beat so fast...
feel as the fire inside me...
fire which burn me inside...
this fire because of the farness...
farness between me and you...
please my lady...
please and let us cut off this distance...
and let me hug you, , ,
as i am hugging the red rose....
