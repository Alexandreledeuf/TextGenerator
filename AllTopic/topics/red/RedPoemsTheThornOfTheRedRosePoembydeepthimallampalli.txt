There was something she thought again in his mysterious smile,
She tried to forget him but it was not possible even for a little while
She got out of her bed and walked around in the corridor
She was not ready to accept but her heart knew whom she was waiting for
It was in the royal banquet where she had met him the previous day
They unknowingly met in quiet an unexpected way
It was less than a moment they had noticed each other
He gave an adorable look and smiled as if he knew her
His eyes fluttered open all of a sudden at the thought of her
She was a perfect young maiden or she was royal rather
He leaned over his windowsill while a white dove came over his shoulder
“I’m almost addicted to her” he said with his clear blue eyes staring at her
The morning had begun with wide and sweet smiles
But was neither everlasting nor lasted for a long while
In his study room he was when the wild news came in
His marriage was fixed on Saturday in the Whackers Inn
The young man tried to persuade his father but, in vain
He only knew about the trouble he had due the love that gave him pain
The young girl came to know that her love would never be in her midst
She decided it was time for her last breath as she decided that she too might not exist
When he came to know that she was no more in his life
He killed himself to save the life of the unknown girl who wanted to be his wife
At the funeral everyone thought about the coincidence, which made all wonder
Why the bride and the groom died as the planned together
