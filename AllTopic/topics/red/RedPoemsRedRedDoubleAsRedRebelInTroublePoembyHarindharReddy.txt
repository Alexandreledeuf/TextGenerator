Viola, I'm the galloping horse in a battle,
The trumpeting elephant in a tide,
The growling tiger ready to collide.
I'm in the hail storm of an acid rain,
the roaring lion sets to die in a fire.
Lo, fighting is my Label, a rebel red;
In trouble as I fell with a rhyme triple.
Rulers have the power just to fire, yet
I'm the counter fire, I never retire, but
I died in a foul encounter, a mystery.
For pollution in their hearts I'm the solution;
Hello! My name is revolution,
The thunder bolt and the wonder volt!
From here does mutiny spreads…..
I'm a rebellion dead as the blood I wed.
As a child I didn't play on the saar, so what?
War is not far, my mouth if I open. Tut!
Know not Mozilla yet I mastered warfare guerrilla,
Can't sneak like a thief nor slither like a snake,
But I tone a slogan, ‘hike-hike my life is at stake.'

Hello-hello fellow class, I did not pass,
In the mass I'm one, let me sing for the poor.
Stalin, Lenin, Mao and Chou are my bosses,
Gun is my friend, pen is my property and
I will fight and fight till I create history.
I'm the dying spirit of my fellow comrades,
A lover of swords and words of Karl Marx.
In the deep woods dark, blood I spill.
For reasons known and in seasons myriad
To change the society into selfless one.
I'm the exponent - a Marxist, Maoist and Titoist;
The proponent - a Castroist, Guevarist and Trotskyist;
The revolutionist - an extremist, radicalist and sydicalist.
Quit using spade bit - a bolshie, commie and naxalite
as a Leftist, a communist yet the A-one humanist am I.
Come, come comrade, oh crimson colored commie!
Cheers, do you hear a boisterous welcome? Yo, red -
To, tovarish, with gazillion cockades red, a bonvoyage.
Heaven and earth you moved so let me bid you adieu;
keep chanting - salaam, salaam comrade, lal salaam!
