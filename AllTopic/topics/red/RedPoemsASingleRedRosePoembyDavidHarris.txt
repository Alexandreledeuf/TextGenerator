A single red rose
lays on a grave,
for someone buried there.
It spoke of love,
that would always remain strong,
even though the loved one was now gone.
It spoke of something lasting,
beyond our living days.
Tells the story about love
that never ever fades away.
The love that seeds devotion,
even after death.
That single red rose spoke to me,
of all the things, we cherish most,
and how much each of us.
Would like to have
that loving care,
with a single red rose for all to see and share.
