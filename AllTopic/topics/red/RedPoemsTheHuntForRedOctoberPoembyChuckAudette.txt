a ping rings so slight
off our submarine hull
faces go white
this isn't a drill
the skipper regards us
with a look that is hard
says 'Who dared to bring
their damn credit card? '
'Please sir, it's me sir'
I step forward and 'fess
'You fool! '  he hissed
Your payments you've missed! '
'We'll be drowned in high fees
snagged in red tape
we'll never get free
with their new interest rates! '
'Dive deep! ' he commands
'We're in hot water now!
But we'll try to escape
their collections so foul! '
The pinging grows louder
we sweat and we fret
their intent is avowed
to collect on the debt
Then explosions begin
our position looks bleak
Final notices pour in
through thousands of leaks
'that's the end of us lads
we'll sink no more barges
It seems they are dropping
those bloody late charges! '
The Captain eyes me
bills up to his waist
growls 'this wouldn't have happened
if you'd paid with due haste! '
'Pardon me, Sir' I gasp
in our pocket of air
'these aren't my bills
- that's YOUR name here'
(hope you liked this poetic sub mission, er.. submission!)
