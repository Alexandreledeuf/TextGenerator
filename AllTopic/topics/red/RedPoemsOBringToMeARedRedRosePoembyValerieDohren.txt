O bring to me a red, red Rose
A symbol of your love
And bring to me a rainbow soft
Plucked from the sky above
For I will give you all I deem
To grant you joy and peace
A heart forever filled with care
That ne`er will ever cease
Then bring, O bring a Violet blue
That faithful I shall be
Always by your side to walk
Together, you and me
Carnations pink I then shall seek
That in my thoughts you`ll stay
In mem`ry you shall there remain
Not e`er to fade away
O bring, O bring an Orchid sweet
That beauty shall incline
Forever in my heart to dwell
Through all the years to shine
A sweet Delphinium I`ll wear
My aspect then to grace
That I may ever be with you
Transcending time and space
An Amaranth shall so endow
My soul, to rise above
All worldly passions set below
To bear immortal love
Then fetch me thus a Lotus flower
That I may see the dawn
Upon its leaf a dewdrop set
My soul to be reborn
O bring to me a Lily, white,
To lay upon my breast
To place it gentlly `cross my heart
When I am laid to rest
