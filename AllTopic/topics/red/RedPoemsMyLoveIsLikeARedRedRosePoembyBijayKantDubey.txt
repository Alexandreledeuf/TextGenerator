My love is like a red, red rose,
You just call her
And she will come,
You just call her
And she will singing a love song,
Whistling and humming
And the breeze carrying the sweet notes.
My love a red-red rose,
A red rose,
the pain of my heart,
The tinge of pain,
The ache of it,
My heartthrob, my heartbeat.
