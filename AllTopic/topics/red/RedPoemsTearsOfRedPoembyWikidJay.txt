Sitting on the curb
Wondering why she does this-it was her
Pale, skin grave
Holding a razorblade
Crying of tears
Mixed with blood
Why was she still here?
She told herself she must
Remembering his arms around her
Said, ' I love you'
How lonely I felt
When he left me with nothing but a pool
A pool full of water
From my tears it formed
A pool of depression at my heart
I'll drown in it while i'm torn
I'm sitting here, at the curb
With my razorblade
He stares at me and says ' you bleed pretty '
When i do nothing but bleed
I turn my right arm over
Let it rest in my skin
Let it bleed until I die
The pain thats in glisten
Despair
Sanity
Anguish
Su icide it screams
Today I die and here I lie
From the wrists I bleed
