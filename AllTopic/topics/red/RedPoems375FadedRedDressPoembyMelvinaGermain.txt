There you were a sight to behold,
quietly sleeping, in shimmering folds.
No heart to disturb your precious rest,
I left you lying there in a faded red dress.
Dream my darling dream as only you can
listen to the song birds, hold them in your hand
I’ll take a walk several blocks away,
When I return we’ll start our day.
beautiful morning, bright and clear,
a glimpse of your shadow mystically near.
Dream my darling dream as only you can
Listen to the song birds, hold them in your hand
Your body laid still, no breathing came.
Fell to my knees and called out your name.
You left me that morning in a faded red dress.
Dreams of a future never will be blessed.
Dream my darling dream as only you can
Listen to the song birds, hold them in your hand
Now all I have left are the sweet memories,
of a beautiful woman, who composed my heart.
I cry every night as my hands firmly press,
the ruffles so sheer, of that faded red dress.
Dream my darling dream as only you can
Listen to the song birds, hold them in your hand.
