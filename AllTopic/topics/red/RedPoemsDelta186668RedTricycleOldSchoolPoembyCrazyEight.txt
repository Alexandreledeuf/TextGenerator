I’ll nettle you from behind
I’ll striddle you from the side
I’ll stalk you in the light
I’ll be there when you die
I’ll watch you when you hide
I’ll scrutinize your tide
I’ll scan your ever lie
I’ll be there when you die
Will you remember me by the susurration of my wrath?
Will you remember what I said last?
Did I stain the back of your mind?
Did I modify your design?
I’ll be there when you die
If the walls talked they'd tell you I’m here
But they can't so I’ll remain your desolated fear
I hear your cryptic moans
I taste your infantine toes
I follow you
Your every thought is downloaded
Your secure walls have eroded
I’ll remain here biding
My closed eyes know where you're hiding
Sound of shadows
I’ll be there when you die
I’ll nettle you from behind
I’ll striddle you from the side
I’ll stalk you in the light
I’ll be there when you die
I’ll watch you when you hide
I’ll scrutinize your tide
I’ll scan every time you lie
I’ll be there when you die
Oh yea
Sound of shadows
I’ll be there when you die
Oh yea
Sound of shadows
Will you remember me by the susurration of my wrath?
Will you remember what I said last?
Did I stain the back of your mind?
Did I modify your design?
I’ll be there when you die
