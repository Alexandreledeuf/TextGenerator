I want to be from there
I want to live there when the sun rise
I want to spend my life there
In the city of your imagine
In the city of your dreaming
In Manchester
No way
It was just a dream
But its possible to Manchester united be my dreaming team
Oh….yeah
This word I dream it more than once
In each match must to be a loser
But not for red demon
With Sir Alex Ferguson there is no chance only to win
My life, soul.and my heart all for red demon
They become cheep when I took a glimpse of the soccer eyes
If you look to Sir Alex Ferguson eyes
You will be relaxed to victor the match
Lets teach Chelsea how the win comes easily when we play against them
Chelsea is nothing without Drogba or who was fasting the goal in the world cup
Chelsea like the lady without a baby without them
Lets told them no champions league again
The champions for red demon only…..
There's no team in the world can face them
Or, to stop in them face
All the soccer there  have an ambitious to win as stone
If you want a goal just pass the ball to golden boy or the player of the show
They're ready to do that all the time
If you want the ball next to  the goal just mention to Giggs that
If you don’t wont any goal against you just give Van dar sar attention before the match
If you want more show just give Ronaldo a signal to do that
I hope to see red demon flying up there in the sky
I wish to see you a moon in the moonlit
