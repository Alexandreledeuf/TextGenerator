(Poet's Word: Dear fellow Amigo! This is a very revolutionary poem which has come from Marina trench of my heart spontaneously - like the flow of brook, when I read lot of novels and real life biographies of comrades, socialists, etc. who were (are)      always immersed in battles of blood for betterment of the poor and down trodden sections of the society in various developing countries.I hope lot of writers read this and write their suggestions, comments and criticism. Wish a happy reading to all the COMRADES!)
I am a trumpeting elephant and high tide,
I am a galloping horse to ride.
I am a growling tiger and ready to collide!
I am a roaring lion with pride.
Hi! Hi! Comrade cheerio!  Comrade
Hiya! Hiya! Comrade, bon-voyage comrade!
I am a thunder bolt! I am a wonder volt!
They may have fire,
But I am a cease-fire and live-wire.
Tire! Tire! I never retire.
I am a hail storm and acid rain.
I am victimized comrade but not thrashed brain,
Hello! Hello! My name is revolution!
Solution! Solution! As your heart is pollution!
Marxist, Maoist, Castroist and I – a Leninist
Guevarist, Titoist, Trotskyist, and I – a Stalinist.
Naxalite, syndicalist, extremist, and I, a revolutionist;
Bolshie, commie, and radical; why these words of spade bit!
Leftist, socialist, communist and I, a humanist fit!
Revolt is my style! Struggle is my file.
In battle, I am grown……
Maoism is my crown.
