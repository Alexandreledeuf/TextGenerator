He was just a little kid
In a kid’s kind of world
Examining the places
Where the red dirt swirled
Hills and little trenches
To climb and investigate
Thoughts and visions
For a child to create
There’s no better place
For a youngster to enjoy
Than in the red dirt country
They don’t even need a toy
Just old-fashioned imagination
That all little children possess
Tucked into their little heads
Many things they can access
There’s nothing like watching
A child in a world of red dirt
Let’s imagine we’re a kid again
You know, it wouldn’t hurt!
