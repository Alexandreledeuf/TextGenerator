I sit alone, it's all too much,
Why can't i just be dead,
I need to free the hurt inside,
So I cry my tears of red.
I watch the blood flow thick and fast,
As I cut deeper every day,
I open up my body,
To bleed my pain away
My body is engraved,
With the emotions of my heart,
My skin's the story of my soul,
I'm a living work of art.
The words read red and clear,
As more blood starts to flow,
I'm holding on to life right now,
But soon I'll let it go.
What have I got to live for,
But to hack into my skin?
Soon I'll make that final cut,
And end all that's within.
