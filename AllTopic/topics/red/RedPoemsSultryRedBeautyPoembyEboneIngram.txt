I'm nervous on the sidewalk,
pacing back and forth
in my ruby red stilletos.
(I hope I look beautiful.)
I'm waiting under a full moon,
in front of your apartment,
eyes on my red-strapped watch.
(You're taking your time, beautiful.)
I'm growing impatient now;
and I look like a streetwalker
in my siren red strapless.
(The men say, 'Hello, Beautiful.')
I see you parking now, late as ever.
You're on the driver's side
of a blood-red Ferrari.
(I always thought that car was beautiful.)
You're stepping out of the car,
And walking to the other side
To hold open the red door.
(A gentleman...how beautiful.)
A woman steps out of the car:
A vixen if I ever saw one,
White smile parting shiny red lips.
(Now I don't feel so beautiful.)
You walk to your apartment door,
your hands, your lips all over her...
At last, you're caught red handed.
(You'd told ME I was beautiful...)
If this is how you treat the comely,
I'd rather be the repulsive Medusa
and stone you for your red deception.
