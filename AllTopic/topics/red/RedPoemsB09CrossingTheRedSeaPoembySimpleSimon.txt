When the king of Egypt,
Let the Israelites go,
God led them not straight
But a roundabout route thro'.
There was a short-cut road;
Yet, a circular way, God preferred,
As in the event of any fight,
They couldn't return to Egypt.
To keep them safe and alert,
He led them thro' the desert,
Trekking o'er the sand,
Towards the Red Sea end.
They were armed for battle,
Ready to fight tooth and nail.
They were very bold this time,
As the Lord was with them.
Joseph's body was in Egypt.
To fulfill his last request,
That his body be taken out,
Moses, with him, brought it.
During the day, as cloud,
God, in front, He led.
Likewise, He went as light,
And led them at night.
Thus, they travelled night and day,
Thro' the God-chosen pathway.
They reached the desert end,
And at Etham, they camped.
What was the picture in Egypt?
The king went in regret
For losing all the slaves,
Who served him for many years.
He took his armed forces
And pursued the Israelites.
He was nearing the camp-site,
With his army ready to fight.
To Moses, the Israelites said,
'Your advice, should we've heard?
Look, what you've done?
Didn't we tell this'll happen? '
'We preferred Egypt's graves,
And remain there as slaves,
Than die here in the desert,
And be thrown in wind and dust.'
Moses assured and said,
'Listen, don't be afraid.
Now, God is on our side.
See the miracle of the Lord.'
To Moses God said,
'Let the people go forward.
Take your stick and lift it.
O'er the sea, you hold it.'
What God said, Moses did.
The sea-water got divided.
They walked on dry ground
Thro' the path, newly found.
Till the last man had crossed,
And other side, they reached,
The sea-ground was open
And God's miracle was on.
With a wave of his stick,
Moses reversed the trick,
When the sea-water closed,
All the enemies were trapped.
The power of the Lord,
The Israelites then realized.
They developed faith in God
And in Moses, the servant of God.
At last, the Egyptians,
Learnt a bitter lesson,
And they had virtually seen,
What God's power had been
