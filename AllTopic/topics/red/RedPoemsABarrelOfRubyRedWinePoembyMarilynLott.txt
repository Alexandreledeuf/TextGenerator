Did you ever see a barrel of wine
With the ruby red liquid trickling down?
Just the thought of the delicious taste
Brings a smile instead of a frown
This wonderful wine is stored carefully
You can almost taste it on your tongue
It's really tremendously exciting
To see what sweet grapes have become
But if you've made another choice
Well, sometimes it's kind of hard
But now you know and can plainly see
It's a treasure right from a vineyard!
