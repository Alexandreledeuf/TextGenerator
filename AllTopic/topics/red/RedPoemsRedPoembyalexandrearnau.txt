i like
red
it dances
for me
rolling
down my fingers
so pretty
red
the way
she dances
so pretty
the red
makes it
better
the floor
shiny
with red
in patterns
i can see them
like butterflies
or faces
dancing
across the patterns
making
new patterns
she makes them
singing
red
so happy
with the singing
and dancing
the red
dances with her
like the rain
on my window
red
so much red
my whole world
red
my hands
red
her pretty dress
red
the floor and walls
red
redredred
so happy
and red
she sang
from the red
on her throat
like a flute
or a fountain
so red
red red red
dancing spasms
to music
on the floor
and in my head
red
whole world red
