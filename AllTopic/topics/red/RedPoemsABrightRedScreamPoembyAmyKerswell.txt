I have bright red angry screams.
Not within the voice of me.
But in the cuts on my arms.
I cut and cut.
Now my scream is out and free.
My screams are nasty red cuts.
Angrier by the day.
Each cut is my
My bright red scream.
Every cut a new scream.
Screaming  louder and louder.
The bright red scream.
Sets me free
If not for long
Just for a while.
