Red Rose Red Lips
Red color of red rose match with your soft lips
I want to caress, kiss all the petals with passion
With sophisticated gestures your eyes give tips
All but seen in real wonderful romantic fashion
Let me be the part of beauty let me see you all
You are my heart solace you are my sweetheart
Her hidden beauty crops up in actions to install
Like a gorgeous lady you are amazing and smart
Let me be the part of your emotional dark nights
Let me bloom like a flower under your all tresses
I will perform duties of love with beauty as rights
Let us make strong in a chain all the love bases
