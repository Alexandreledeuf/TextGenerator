Walking to Grandma’s house was such a chore
For nymphomaniac Little Red Riding Whore
The woods were boring and devoid of decent men
So she had to stop to finger herself every now and again
There was even a passing branch that looked so strong
She had to straddle it’s length and slide it in past her thong
There were dangers in the woods Riding Whore had been told
Of a vicious man eating wolf whose blood was cold
Riding Whore had no fear of such creatures of the night
Her only fear was not getting shagged before the morning light
In a part of the forest where the trees grew high and dark
From beside her Riding Whore heard a low rumbling bark
The wolf was on her in a flash snapping jaws at her throat
But all Riding Whore could think was “What a sexy soft coat”
She avoided the wolf’s bite with a fraction of an inch to spare
She reached down between his legs searching around in his hair
The unfortunate wolf couldn’t have known what was going on
Before Riding Whore had him on his back with a raging hardon
She pinned the wolf down with a frightening strength for a girl
And fucked the wolf so hard his hair began to curl
When  she finally came, her cry rang loud in the air
But after masturbating all day she didn’t really care
She climbed off the wolf and dusted herself down
Began to walk away, then turned back with a frown
The wolf lay still, there was no need to check pulse or breath
She was impressed with herself for she had fucked him to death
So on she went to her Grandma’s house, one thing in her mind on the track
‘I wonder if he had any brothers that wolf who could do me on the way back? ’
