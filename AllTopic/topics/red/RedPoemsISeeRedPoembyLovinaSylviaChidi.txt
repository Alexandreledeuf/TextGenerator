In a moment of silence
I ponder
Thinking of the pressure that Iâ€™m under
Should I resort to violence?
I see red like a blood thirsty vampire
I feel red like a hot faced town crier
It is as if I've been hit with a set of pliers
While disappointed in the one I used to admire
Yesterday before and after I went to bed
I dreamt of nothing else but the dead
I saw a vision of the rolling of heads
You've stabbed me and I have bled
My eyes are still steaming hot and red
These vicious rumours that you've spread
While I blindly followed and you led
Now I question myself instead
Of all the things that have been said
Have I knowingly been misled?
Without recognising what was ahead
I know positive thoughts I must embed
Peace is the message we want widespread
Not red with more bloodshed
What is really weird, is whenever we see  red
That negative vision can so easily be shred
