A smile on my face - Will never reach my eyes
You see laughs and jokes - they see all the lies
You bleed red and I bleed black
You're so great and I'm off track
You're the stick and I'm so not
You beat everything I've got
You have friends while I have none
When I'm sad you're having fun
You're so good and I'm so bad
That's the reason that I'm sad
Tommorow I'll be smiling - but my face is set in stone
The next I'll be gone - you'll be the one that's all alone
