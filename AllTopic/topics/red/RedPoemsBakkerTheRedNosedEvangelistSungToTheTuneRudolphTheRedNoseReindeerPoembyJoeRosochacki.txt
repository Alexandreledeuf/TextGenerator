You know Ken Copeland, Ben Hinn, and Joyce Meyer,
Paula White, Eddie Long, and Creflo Dollar,
But do you recall the most tele-evangelist of all,
Jim Bakker the house hold evangelist,
Had a very shinny nose,
And if you ever saw it,
When he was crying,
You would ever say it glows.
All of the evangelists
Used to laugh and call him names,
They never let poor Bakker
Join in tax evasion games.
Ten one foggy audit day
Oral Roberts came to say,
Peter get your cooked books out tonight,
Join Bakker in the tax fraud fight. (see Observation Jimmy the Geek)
Then all the evangelists loved him,
And they shouted with glee,
Jimmy and Tammy Bakker,
You'll go down in history.
