Staring at a single read rose, so much beauty
not as much to be wasted on someone as beautiful
each thorn a reminder, love can hurt
but each detailed petal a bounty of great beauty
take this rose
from my beloved fingers
never cover the red
for the beauty will then be hidden
from the world at which it came
never hide your beauty
for each day should it be shared with the world
prooving each rose
has the beauty of your smile
this single red, red rose
my single loving heart
take it as a token
of the love
we will forever share
