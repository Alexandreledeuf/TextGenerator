Red is the colour of tomato sauce dripping down the side of your hamburger
Red is the feeling after exercise
Red is the sound of silence
Red is the colour of warm blood flooding your veins
Red is the smell of sweets lying in their containers at the supermarket
Red is the sound of pain
Red is the taste of hot chilli risotto
Red is the colour of bright luscious lipstick
Red is the feeling of joy
Red is the taste of jam toast soldiers for breakfast
Red is the sun setting in the evening
Red is the colour of poppies swaying in the fields
Red is the sweltering Sahara desert
Red is the colour of a ripe cherry resting on a dollop of cream
Red is the feeling of love
Red is the taste of mouth watering cheesy takeaway pizza
Red is the R&B music
Red is a colour that is safe and alive.
