It's sumertime,
School vacation has begun,
Time for children to play,
And have fun in the sun.
Now the children
Are out of school,
There are trees to climb,
Swimming in the pool.
Time to spend
With special friends.
Seems they're on the go
Until the days end.
But when summer vacation
Is finally through,
It's time to hit the books
And return to school.
