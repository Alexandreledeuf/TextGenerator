Summer breeze
summer long
I'll sing to you
my summer song
Read a poem
A summer song
It isn't long
It's just a song
From my heart
a poem long
but not at all
my summer song
My summer long
is something special
a poem, a song
to my heart belong
Summer breeze
summer long
I'll sing to you
my summer song
