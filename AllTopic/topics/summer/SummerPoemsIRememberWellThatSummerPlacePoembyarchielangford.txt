I remember well that summer place,
The sun, the sea, the surf soaked sand,
The light that lit your lovley face,
As we splashed bare foot, hand in hand.
And in the evening on the pier,
Our bodies sore from too much sun,
Tenderly I held you near,
We danced to Cyril Stapleton.
And later in that gox on wheels,
Laughingly called a caravan,
Where we cooked our meagre meals,
And loved as only lovers can.
And now so many years have passed,
I`ve grown old, (I hope with grace) .
Countless memories I`ve amassed,
But I remember well that summer place.
