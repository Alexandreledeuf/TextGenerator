What do you have to say
On this day
In the month of April and May
Everybody is gay
This is the summer time
When people go to the beaches
They have juice made of lime
And fruits like mangoes and peaches
Many people like to stay indoors
And try their best to keep cool
Just staying inside really bores
So they want to have a dip in the pool
These are times of holidays
When we play and run
Some people show off the beauty of their face
At summer we have a lot of fun
