In that summer of loving you
I was free
All things were possible
And I believed them all
In that summer of loving you
I was beautiful
I saw myself in your eyes
And I was wonderful
In that summer of loving you
I danced with passion
In and out of arms of love
And you held me
In that summer of loving you
I was laughter
You laughed with me
But never at me
In that summer of loving you
I lost you
And my heart was breaking...   As you left me
