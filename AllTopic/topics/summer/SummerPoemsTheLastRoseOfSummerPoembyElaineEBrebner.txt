The last rose of summer lingers of a soft fragrance
as the days of summer fade into days only remembered
over the fires embers that stir yesterdays moment.
The last rose of summer whose beauty brought love and caring
in the cool evening breeze to a heart
touched briefly by its petals of soft color.
The last rose of summer that but briefly spoke of tenderness
to a heart in the stillness of the night
to be remembered in the quiet fragrance of a rose.
The last rose of summer whose petals are pressed to a book
hiding it's treasure of yesterdays love
remembering days held in time not to be forgotten.
