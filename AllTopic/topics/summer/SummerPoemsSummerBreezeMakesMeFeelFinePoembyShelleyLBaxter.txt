Rolling blades of grass play in the meadows green,
as bird songs whisper my name in the trees...
the breeze circles me enfolding me in its tune,
a serenade that happens on beautiful days in June.
The wind entices me with its strength to cool,
as the sun rejuvenates me with its warmth,
leaving me every so often the sky clouds over and wind ceases,
thus causing me to ponder which climate I treasure most.
Could it be the slight breeze?
which engulfs my being with the promise that a new day will unfold?
Or the heat of the bright sun rays waterfall,
which makes me squint till I close my eyes to dream?
Each force of nature wonderfully displayed and Splendid!
Each sensation inspiring to my mind, body and soul!
Both together fill me with wonder which envelopes me...
with the memories of past summer days untold.
