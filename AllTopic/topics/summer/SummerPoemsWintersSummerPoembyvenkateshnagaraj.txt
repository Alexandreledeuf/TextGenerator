Winter without you is like
a summer in a winter, when memories
of your love  murmur in my winter.
Summer in a winter was never been
hot as it is.when  the memories
of  your love  thrills me today.
Winters summer were very rare when
we walked on the bed of purple flowers
with your affectionate look.
When I forget this heat and
hold you in my poetic arms, you
kiss my  poem through your heart
in this winter.
winter's summer was very rare...
