I didn't write that novel
I've dreamed of for many years
Nor did I climb Mt. Everest
(I'm really scared of heights)
I didn't swim the English Channel
(It was a bit too far)
I didn't win a Pulitzer
Nor was Woman of the Year
I didn't have a face lift
Nor lose those extra pounds
Instead I did the usual
Housework, gardening, and such.
But while my hands performed their tasks
Those mundane, boring chores
My thoughts ranged far and wide
And I accomplished miracles
If only in my mind.
