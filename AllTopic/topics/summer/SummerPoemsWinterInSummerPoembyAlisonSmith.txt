Hear the thunder echoing about
A sky with a green hue
The sign of hail on the way
Lighting giving a great show
Like a fireworks display.
And in the morning
Where once the plants
Were dying from the heat
Now covered with a blanket of white.
Which many have never seen.
During the night
While most slept
Winter had stolen the Summer
And left a winter scene.
Nearly forget the devastation
With such a wonderous scene
The day in Summer
When the land down under
Woke to a Winter scene.
(* Feb 28th.... Canberra Australia's capital... was turned into winter *)
