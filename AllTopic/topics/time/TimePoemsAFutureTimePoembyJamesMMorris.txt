A future time, a future place
Here on Earth or out in space
The doors are open if you choose
To learn the skills that you can use
Computers you use every day
Atomic medicine is here to stay
A walk on the moon is a thing of the past
We're on our way to the stars at long last
Radar, and laser, and quasar, and such,
These words sound strange, but they mean so much
Learn these things, and many more
See what wonders the world has in store
Don't let folly lead you away
From Learning the skills you need so today
Have fun in your life, but don't learn with sorrow
That the fun of today won't feed you tomorrow
Be good to yourself, and study with zest,
And, soon, you will find you're ahead of the rest
A future time, a future place
Here on Earth or out in space
The doors are open, come on through
Learn the skills, it's up to you
