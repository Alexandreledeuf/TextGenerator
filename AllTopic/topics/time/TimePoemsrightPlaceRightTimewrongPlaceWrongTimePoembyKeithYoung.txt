“Right Place - Right Time” “Wrong Place – Wrong Time”
We all end up there
We believe it’s the right place
We believe it’s the right time
Why do we want it to be the right place?
Why is it always the wrong place?
Why is it always the wrong time?
“Right Place - Right Time” “Wrong Place – Wrong Time”
We are happy when we are in the right place at the right time
Yet when we are in the wrong place at the wrong time
We are lost
We feel like noting
We are sad
We cry
Our feelings getting hurt
Why can’t we be in the right place all the time?
Why can we be in the right time?
