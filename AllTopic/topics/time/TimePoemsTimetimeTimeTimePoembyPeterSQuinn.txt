Time time time time
You flow in your tides
And rises to every prime
That through the ages guides
Oh come here in your chance
And bring each us through
Like tint leaves in trance
Each one for me and you
Time time the hour is still
With dreams to pass by
And every ones fulfill
Until they fade and fly
Oh rush not these senses
That makes us their joy
When hours flow and dances
As time they destroy
Time you always are new
Though old you sometime seems
When you are going though
In reality and dreams
And wander to the ways
That comes to each of us
Like night and waking days
That sometimes are in rush
