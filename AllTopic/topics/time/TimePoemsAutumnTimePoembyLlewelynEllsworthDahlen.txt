There's a time to enjoy
The flowers of spring
And all those pleasures
That summer will bring
But as the winds will change
And the summer will set
Nature paints a picture
That's hard to forget
Treasure the autumn
All those painted leaves
The crisp fall air
On those moon lit eves
It's a blessing at best
Not costing a dime
For all to enjoy
Yes --- it's autumn time..
