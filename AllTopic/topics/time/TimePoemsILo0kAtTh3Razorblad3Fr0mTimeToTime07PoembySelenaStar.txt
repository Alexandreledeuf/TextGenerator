*this poem was written about a friend,
and what she is going thru these days*
i quit cutting a while back
and im doing good
no slits on my wrists,
no blood going down my arm,
everything was fine
i had even quit using my 'rubber buddy'
but its not so easy
when your family is like mine
an alchoholic dad,
who's acts more like a kid than i do
hes always yelling
and calling me names
a stubborn sister,
who loves to blackmail me
and who acts like i get everything
when everything=all of their crap
a god worshiping mother,
who thinks im the one causing her to take meds
she blames me when mistakes happen
she even thought i was pregnant one time
but as hard as it was,
i held back the anger, the hurt, every feeling
and now i wana let it loose
the tamed lion wants out!
i promised my brother,
i wouldnt cut again
and i have to stick to my promise
no matter what!
but every now and then
i catch myself, looking at the razorblade again
