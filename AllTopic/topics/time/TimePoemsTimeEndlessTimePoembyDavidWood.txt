The seasons always come around;
For time cannot be interrupted
A frigid winter cold and frosty
Gives way to a fleeting spring
Where new life is found.
Time is a never ending race,
The hours, days and weeks pass,
Sometimes unnoticed in our busy lives
Then the long eternity comes with a kiss
When our time gives up its final pace.
Time is something  we have to give
To those whom we love, it can't be rushed
It is a soothing balm to heal and calm
When all of life becomes too much
And tender hearts again learn to live.
Time is like the vast vacuum of space,
It is endless. Time is forgiving if not rushed
And we have to catch those special
Moments in time as it cannot be reversed
And guard them with such sweet grace.
