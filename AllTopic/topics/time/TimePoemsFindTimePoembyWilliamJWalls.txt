Find time, for this day shall soon be night
Find time to love, whilst you still have life
Find time to visit the sick and the old
Find time to embrace someone when they are cold.
Find time to love your family, and help a friend
Find time to invite a hungry person in
Find time to take a senior person for a walk
Find time for that someone that's lonely just to talk.
And when you've found time for these things
Rejoice and be happy for the satisfaction it brings.
