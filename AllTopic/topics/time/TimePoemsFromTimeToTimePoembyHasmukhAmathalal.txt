Nothing is higher
Than honor and pride
No one is dearer
Than father and mother
There is priority
Even for good quality
Food is tested
Even if looked best
Friendship counts more
Its test can be made on floor
“Friend in deed is friend indeed”
Rest all people are full of greed
The legend is full of sayings
No one make specific drawings
It has path of its own
Its dependability is always known
No one goes near snake
As everybody knows “life is at stake”
Similarly dangerous people are kept at distance
As nobody would want to take any chance
Everything is precisely narrated
Good and bad is balanced and equated
Only it needs to be updated
From time to time and tested
