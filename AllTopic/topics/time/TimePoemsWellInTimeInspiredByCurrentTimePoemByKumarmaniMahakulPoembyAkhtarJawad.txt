When He ordered me to pray at once,
I left the bed,
I washed my hands,
my mouth and my feet.
I walked to a nearby mosque,
and when I started praying,
I found myself in a different moment.
Alas! I could not follow His orders well in time.
How can I get what I prayed for?
Tears came in my eyes!
How helpless is the man!
But my great teacher wiped my tears.
Congratulated me,
and asked me to smile,
as He gave me that
what I prayed for,
immediately when I intended to pray for it.
My intentions were well in time.
Man is not so much helpless!
