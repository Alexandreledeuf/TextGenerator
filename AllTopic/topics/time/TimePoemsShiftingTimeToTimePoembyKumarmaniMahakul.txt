Life is shifting time to time
As from birth to death we do
We work whole day and take rest
Birds search nest at evening.
Who stays on rent or leaves old
Home is searched to establish
Some feel nice in villages near
Some search town and some cities.
Shifting is associated with habit
In migration we see necessity sure
Life changes and dazzles in search
Some do not attach mind in world.
Shifting of mind from the dark
This proceeds towards pure light
To revive faith and establish
We look forward God's wisdom sure.
