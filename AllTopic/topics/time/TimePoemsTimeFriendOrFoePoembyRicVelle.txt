Times gives life meaning and sustenance, so we're all
somewhat on common ground, so life doesn't confound.
Time doesn't stay the same, nor does the world.
Time goes slow and sometimes fast, and with hope, we shall last.
Time can be lost, and it can cost.
Time can be harnessed, and it can slip through the hand like granules of sand.
Time is a friend or foe, this I know.
Time is a second, a minute, or an hour, it may devour.
Time controls and consoles.
Time, at times, is the aggressor and the lesser, a comforter.
Time heals and steals. Time brings hope and sometimes despair.
Time can repair, and it can be unfair.
Time is eternity, together, with Christ,
the King of Kings, we shall be.
