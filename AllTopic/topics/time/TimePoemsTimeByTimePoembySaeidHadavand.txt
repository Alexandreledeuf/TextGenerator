Time by Time
Bide your time
There is no time to hold the time
Just pay the dime and drink the wine
That's all the fine...
Go out a ride, nothing to hide
Forget behind and dance the jive
It will be fine...
Go build a kite and make it fly
Just live the life by rest and lie
Relax the mind, exact the mine
Work on the five, solve it to nine
Grow a pine, love it so kind
...
Naked sky, the moon, the tide
See their pride, just don't cry
The sun, the shine, the crazy vine
Look them the while, you're not to shy
I say and try: to wipe the dark and paint it white
