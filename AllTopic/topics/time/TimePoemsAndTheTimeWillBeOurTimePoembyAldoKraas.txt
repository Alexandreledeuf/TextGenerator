And the time will be our time to pray
And the time will be our time to learn to love the people here on earth
And the time will be our time for us to learn to get along with the people Here on the earth
And the time will be our time to unite the world by bringing peole together All over the world
And our time will be the time to share some food with the homeless people That lives in the street here at home
But also we have to learn that we could end up like them if we don't Watch our money
