I thank God time and time again
I thank God every day
I am always thanking God
Or always trying to thank God-
But who am I to thank God?
And what does this really mean?
I have been given so much
And without God all will forever be nothing-
I thank God because I know I will always need God
I thank God because I fear God
I thank God because I truly appreciate what I have been given
God has given me so much. How can I not thank God?
