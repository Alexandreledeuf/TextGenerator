A time to laugh, a time to cry,
A time to love, a time to sigh.
The love we feel is put in us to stay,
Love will make us stronger each and every
day.
A time to fear, a time to learn.
A time to trust, a time for concern.
The love we feel is real and pure,
Love is the answer and sometimes the cure.
A time for planting, a time to grow,
A time for knowledge of the important things
we must know.
Love is you love is me.
We are one and always will be.
My love for my fellow man, will never grow
dim,
I'll trust, I'll laugh and at times I'll
cry with him.
Now I know why love is put in me to stay,
For real love is not love until you give
it away.
