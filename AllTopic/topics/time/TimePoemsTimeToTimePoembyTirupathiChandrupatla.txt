A solid rock may
Look stationary
Deep inside its atoms
Electrons move.
Things change
From time to time.
The universe appears
Still to the eye
Planets and stars
Keep on moving.
Things change
From time to time.
What I think now
Is not the same
As fixed thoughts
Of yesterday.
Things change
From time to time.
Objects move
Experience teaches
Knowledge provides
New points of view.
Things change
From time to time.
