Time and time and time
again
i've sought a perfect rhyme
time and time and time
again
it just comes to me
when
those times and times and times and times
i've searched for that one
word
i think that writing poetry is something quite
absurd
you balance on the tightrope and then sometimes
lose
your
nerve.........
