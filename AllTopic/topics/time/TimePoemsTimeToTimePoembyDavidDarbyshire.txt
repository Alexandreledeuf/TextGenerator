Time has no conclusion
it will never terminate
Time waits for nobody
seems we are always late
In our dimension
of eternity
Time is our future
and its Infinity
back to present day
the hours transcend
the seconds hop by
Time is our friend
So as time ticks by
and the young become
Old, pull up your sock's
And wind your clock's
