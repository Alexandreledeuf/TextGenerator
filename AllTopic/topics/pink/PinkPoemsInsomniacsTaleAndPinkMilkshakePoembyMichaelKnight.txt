I’m In the Cresta Lodge Botswana
It was 10h00 at night – sudden need for ice cold coke
Down to the bar – Coke and Ice Please
Not a good idea feeling like I’m gonna have difficulty falling asleep again tonight, but the coke I need despite the intended sleeping fight
I finish the coke‘t was Ice cold and refreshing
Get into bed to sleep – but the coke energy now is keeping sleep a testing
After 11h00 I am still awake
Suddenly I need something else – pink milkshake – it shouldn’t keep me awake
Where do these cravings stem?
Like a pregnant womans woe’s
For future reference
I will not argue such a womans preference
Get in my car at 11h30 to nearest convenience store (Shell garage)
They don’t sell pink milkshake – I settle for a small coke again
Let’s find another garage – closed – also don’t sell milkshake – what a pain
I know this won’t keep me awake – I don’t like another shake
Back to the hotel now
I read a book– A New Earth – is this my ego or the “I” in me
Do I need this for ego fulfillment or does my body really need this nourishment
Maybe if I continue reading I’ll get the answer
Although I really would like to sleep now
It’s late
I need to be fresh in the morning
I have students hanging on every word I utter
My words to them usually dont'melt like butter
My butter will be very hard and cold if I am not at my best
The faith they have in me will not stand the test
I need to sleep now – try my best
If I try too hard I know I won’t rest
Hopefully by telling my Insomniac tale
My mind won’t wait too long
To sing it’s sleeping song
And Hopefully I’ll be dreaming about drinking my pink milkshake
Satisfying this unfulfilled need while dreaming
