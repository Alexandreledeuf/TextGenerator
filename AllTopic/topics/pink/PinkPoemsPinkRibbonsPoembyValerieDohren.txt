Pink ribbons span the evening sky
And trim your feathered bed
Now I will sing a lullaby
Lay down your sleepy head
You are the universal child
You, the child of the world
Born as to be yet sweet and mild
With hair that`s softly curled
The world has seen another day
The earth has turned again
The birds have watched you laugh and play
Betwixt the sun and rain
You are the universal child
You, the child of the world
By Mother Nature you are styled
In whom the rest are furled
The world has passed yet slowly by
This earth so turned in vain
For, sorrowing, it saw you cry
And felt your silent pain
You are the universal child
You, the child of the world
I pray you'll never be defiled
Nor fear at you be hurled
