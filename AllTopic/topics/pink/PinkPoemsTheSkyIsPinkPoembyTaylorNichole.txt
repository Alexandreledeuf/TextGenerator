The sky is pink
The grass is blue
Up is down
And so are you
To run is walk
When left is right
Hop is fly
And black is white
East is west
The sun is green
The walls above
The floor between
The rain goes up
The dirt comes down
Glad is sad
And smile is frown
To hear is speak
To see is smell
Down are clouds
And up are wells
When you are me
And I am you
Nobody knows
Just what to do
