Your territory whence your'I'
Looks into the whole world
Blinking for hopeful knowing
Now impinged upon
Perpetrating culprit acute, viral
Trenching violently bloody grit
Sliming your domain purulent..
Pained bulge rubbing for normalcy
You're a wispy dull pupil now
Looking at others for help
I but can not be  inflamed infectious
By you and they Madras-eyed...sorry
