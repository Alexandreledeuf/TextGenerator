There she sat, head tilted back in elegance
Pushed
By her father in her
Pink plastic chariot
Barely two years old
With golden multicultural skin
A crown of silken shiny curls
Framed her gorgeous face of regency
Style, heirs and grace
And she knew
She was fabulous
As she was whooshed past my
Car window
Off through the grey sordid concerete
As a bright cheery spot
Pushed by her proud, proud father
Gracefully
Picking her tiny
Button nose
