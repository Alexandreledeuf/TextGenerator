From whispers to heavy noise
My art of love as it melted
In fine connections invisible
From below the arch of brow
In pink I read your eyes
My pride bent in salutation
Your whole being is surrounded
By the music inside my head
My languor and your rhythm
The melody living in my steps
From the sorrows of silence
Sing the song of spring
To the colors of garden again
My empty cup waiting your glance
Come like zephyr from the east
In the street of rapture my garment
Be the banner of the lovers who
Stained in blood for the stones
Let not doubt like the old lady
When Farhad gave his life in blood
When in the dropp of my wine
I see the earth descended in goblet
Red with wine is the horizon
From the depth of heart sing love
I carry the tradition of Majnun
