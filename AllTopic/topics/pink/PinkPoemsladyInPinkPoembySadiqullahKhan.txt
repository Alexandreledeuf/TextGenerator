The pink of the sunset was like the droop
From the shoulders like the folds in soft
Rays gleamed like diamonds in gold red
From the below sand white was the skirt
From the sharp of creases into the curves
The dunes of sand had shifted overnight
Like the thin line on the lip the shore had
For the surfing ocean of desires spoken time
The lumination was to the night in contrast
On first fingers like rings of the lady in pink
Mermaid to the one on the rock on the amber
Ambition had restraints but may the beauty
Her hand for the kiss before wine of madness
Her legs like widening clayman’s sculpture
Between the legs succulent petals and butterflies
She had the mounds of ice with tips transparent
An evening with music will she adore the night
Mushrooms and prawns and dances like fish
With smooth flexion will her lips on the chain
She but knows how to love from fairy’s land
