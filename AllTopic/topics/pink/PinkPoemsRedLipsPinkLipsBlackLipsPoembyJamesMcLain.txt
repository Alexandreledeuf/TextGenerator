Red Lips, are one plan
and the fires they light
burn too hot..Pink lips,
cause me too shiver.
When seen through
transparent windows,
and coiled and fresh
like the oyster, they are.
And black lips shake me
too my core,
and say things, that i need
you to hear me say.
Front or back, in between
they all set me up.
And they move me like rain
back and forth.
The tounge brings me down
and your hand brings me up
from my knees.
That privilege of full lips is not
lost on me,
it's a simple matter of my pride.
