When you leave me
I feel wounded, uneasy and yet unshaken
I feel sad, unhappy but never forsaken.
Why this happens
Do you ever know that?
I feel overwhelmed with the sky
With the rainbow  above.
I drank the cup
To the last drop
As I felt unquenchable thirst
Of Loveâ€¦..
I know you never left me alone.
You remain with me for ever
You ever brightly shone
You can leave me never, never.
We have found each other
Discovered all the sweetness under the sun
After all the enquiry I have  made,
You simply made of it a fun.
Do you at all know?
What  your eyes with tears did  show
My love for you was a sacred vow.
I saw in your eyes
A  pink pink rose
What is its exact colour
Nobody but me knows.
