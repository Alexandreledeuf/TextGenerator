I sit on the bed...
waiting to finally meet you..
my heart's racing..
I cannot hide my excitement.
thoughts fill my mind, of how the night will turn out...
you knock, once, then enter the room.
everythings still as we take in eachother.
you hold your arms out..
and i walk into your embrace... wrapping my arms around your neck...
you whisper in my mouth i love you my  kay...
i love you too, love....
i smile... as you gently undress me..
i stare into your eyes, offering you no help,
but encouraging more...
you look at me as if to ask 'are you sure? '
i bite my lip and whisper ' whatever you want.'
you gently but eagerly push me back to the bed...
taking care of me..
devouring my love box..
our legs around eachothers neck...
i do the same... tending to your wand...
i'm yours... i whisper... teach me...
i learn the secrets of your life....of your love
and we share this special night together...
i awake... alone.... remembering the things  my love has taught me in my sleep.
