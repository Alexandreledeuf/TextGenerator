I sometimes wear shocking pink underwear.
It is my act of rebellion against those who
always tell me that I am too pale for bright colours.
I wear it under my black dress... with no shoes
and a daring glint in my eyes
A rebellious spirit, according to the Bible,
is the same as witchcraft....
Maybe I am a witch, bewitching you with my black clothes,
pale skin, and pink underwear
Maybe I am an angel, with my bare feet.....
running circles around your enchanted imagination
