One of the Bahamas' best-kept secrets is Harbour Island, a three-mile-long, half-mile-wide speck off the coast of Eleuthera. With 18th-century clapboard houses edged with picket fences, this tiny island looks as if someone shrank Nantucket and plopped it down in the tropics. Cars are forbidden and are replaced by golf carts. Aptly named Pink Sands Beach runs the length of the island, speckled with the perfect blush of flamingo pink. Kids can horseback ride along the shores or don a mask and snorkel to go eyeball-to-eyeball with the tropical fish.
