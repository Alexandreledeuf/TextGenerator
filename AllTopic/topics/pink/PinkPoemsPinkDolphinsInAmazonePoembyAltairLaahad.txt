It happened once in amazon
The wooden boat set sail alone
With little kids and mom and dad
Were jovial all together glad
They sail to see another world
Of trees and bees yet never told
The dolphins there are scarce and rare
They swim and dance, yet not aware
Their days ahead are hard and harsh
As fire and steel began the march
Around their scope of clean, pristine
lagoons and land, all clear and fine
The little boat at central point
Of water world, it lost the joint
With real world of far away
as little kids felt strong dismay
They raised their eyes to dad and mom
Amid the loss where no bees hum
And as the fear began to steer
The dolphins click was near and near
