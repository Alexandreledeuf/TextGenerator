The rain drizzles down,
Soft and sun-kissed
Falling lazily through a sacrosanct sunbeam
In a hazy opalescent mist,
A tarnished key, a pink velvet door
Unsullied and untouched by time.
There is no past, no present, no future.
There is only this moment,
This ever present, yet ever elusive now.
I step onto a wave of plush ivory carpet
Cresting and ebbing under my feet.
Alive with sunsets, moonbeams,
Stardust and dreams.
Over in the corner,
A piano whispers,
A ghostly movement catches my eye.
Suddenly,
The pungent scent of Tabu perfume;
The scent of a woman;
The scent of my mother.
The aroma and texture of childhood days;
The smiles and tears,
Played on piano strings,
Wrapped in angel wings,
Still live and breathe
In the eternal now.
The pink velvet door;
The pink velvet room;
This is what dreams may come.
