A beautiful dozen of pink roses
were delivered to our home today.
I didn't know who sent them
for on the note it didn't say.
It was our address, that was what I'd seen
but the name for whom it was sent, was for a, Mrs. Irene.
I read the note that was attached
in it read a message of friendship, love and hope.
'I hope you 're feeling better dear friend.'
this was what the senders note had wrote.
I told the delivery man
That there must be some mistake.
For my name is not, Mrs.Irene
that was the last home owner
so here's your flowers back, to take.
Mrs Irene didn't make it, that was what her husband said
she had battled cancer, and had fought it well.
But I think she sees the pink roses, maybe sent a bit too late
and is enjoying the sweetness of their flowers smell.
