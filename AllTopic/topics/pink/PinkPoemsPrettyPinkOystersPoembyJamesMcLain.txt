Shell of defenselessness
i rip it brutally
open
tearing the soft oink flesh
steamy tendrils whisper
sweetly
i could not wait
to clutch at them within held in
it's meaty muscle of sweetness
held tartly shut
clenched against me
in vein this blood
i drink
cutting with teeth desire is
hungers appetite
pushing to pull at the edges
as it's now beaton
sound a soft plop gives
way to my sucking mouth
inflamed full pink stomach
pumped
into mine...
