I see the red pink nebulas of Orion
that only You are able to unravel
where other stars still are forming
and there’s a bright white light
that shines through it all
and the seven sisters that You alone
are binding together
and I know that You control the laws
of the heavens
and hold sway on earth
l’Envoi
that You will turn off the lights of that solar system,
the sun and moon
on Your predestined time and day
but Lord
I keep hoping for Your big appearing day
and wait like the cabbalistic doctrine
for You to return glorious
to this old earth.
