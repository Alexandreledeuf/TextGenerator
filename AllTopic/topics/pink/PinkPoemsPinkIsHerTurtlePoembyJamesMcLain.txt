Does not making you happy, with a snappier pink,
make you excited? Snap, snap...your lips did they...purse
this word, or discard it...?
Who would not die, to scream her oinks all there life,
do you fear, will these simple words,
, requested...now get me arrested...
New clean words, washed free, over and over again.
Do they really, sound quite like the others, in your mind..?
Blush me, I will blush you to death, i live for your blush.
your blush drowns me, in seas of pink, that make you oink.
Did you take all my blush?
Please wait, It for you, will make oceans more.
