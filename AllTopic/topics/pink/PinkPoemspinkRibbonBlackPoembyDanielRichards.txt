I’m a restless and corrupted one
Hoping for eternal darkness
And an end to they bright shining sun
I’m tearfully dry, embroiled by fear
Trapped inside my tired mind
Cold mountains close in and harshness is here
My sun set, back so many years
Got lost among my tethered roads,
Knowing the way of only not knowing where to go
Into the distance, a pink ribbon of black
I don’t know how it happened but I’m broken
Stretched to the point of no turning back
Ice now over tipped my wings,
The earth approaching fast,
This bird no long swoops and no longer swings
Earth approaching fast,
Spiraling, out of control I lost my grasp,
Earthbound misfit approaching fast
Pink dreams irresistible
That pink ribbon still so black
Pink ribbon black incredible….
I’m pulling back
