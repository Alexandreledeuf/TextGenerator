In the shade of my live oak tree,
Drinking pink lemonade.
Just about as laid back as can be,
Oh boy, I really got it made.
A little tart, a little sweet, ,
Best batch Elvira's ever made.
Time to get off my tired feet,
With a cold glass of lemonade.
I could use a cookie, I suppose,
But I don't want to leave this shade.
Maybe later, after I repose,
Right now I'll sip my lemonade.
