Say goodbye
In pink satin
A schoolgirl grown
Now gone
Her hair of blonde
Time twirled with gray
She slips away
As did our days
Of dance and sash
Pink satin flash
My memory stepped
In sepia stories
Shared in a vessel
JUST US
A ship of fools
Tied to the dock
Of yesterday's dreams
Watching sunsets
We'd never recapture
Believing then, we'd live forever
In the disco music melodies
We hummed in perfect harmony
And making waves where ever
We thought to cast our lines
Out of sight, yes
Out of mind, no
We flip through the dog-earred
Photo album pages
To find our young tanned faces
Without the wrinkles of worry
In the gaity of gravity
Still On our side
The details colors that painted
Our mural of friends
Ever slightly now fades pale
Pink satin.
