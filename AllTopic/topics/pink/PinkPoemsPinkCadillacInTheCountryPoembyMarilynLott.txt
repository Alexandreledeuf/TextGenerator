He was lookin’ kinda cool
Against his ‘pink Cadillac’
Looking on ahead of him
But still always looking back
On a red dirt country road
He took a little cruise
Windows open and breathing in
Fresh air that always renews
Route 66 was the perfect place to drive
Across a farm with a brick-red barn
Wheat fields waving in the breeze
A world with so much charm
Old gas station from back in the day
That always makes you smile
Keep right on a’driving though
On that red road for awhile
Windmills dot the countryside
They complete that country air
Listening to country music
Ah yes, nothing can compare
So you take a country boy like John
Give him a Pink Cadillac
And he’ll look straight on ahead
But still continues to look back!
