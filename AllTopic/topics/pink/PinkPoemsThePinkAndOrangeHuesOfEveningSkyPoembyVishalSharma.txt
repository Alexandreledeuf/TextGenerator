The pink and orange hues of evening
sky,
are beautiful yet sad, as all goodbyes.
With each breath, I can feel life's
fading out,
and hear myself, call out your name
aloud.
An inverted 'V', after a tough day's
test;
a formation of flock, heading to the
nest.
Each morning glows, then grows to
same old night;
the reason, my heart sinks at sunset
sight.
The early morning flight of hope and
pride,
shall culminate, when tired wings
alight.
