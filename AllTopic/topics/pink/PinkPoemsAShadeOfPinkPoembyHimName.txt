could my loved one ever forgive me
in that sin witch i so carelessly alowed to happen
i never thought that i could be so blind not even i could have seen
but now it is over will she ever love me again or will she too shun my touch
will she too leave me in the world alone to cry
or enbrace me to be more than that shell that i am
will i live to see another day with out her
maybe or maybe i will love again
no never could anyone replace her she is mine as i am hers
for she is my Annabel Lee and i am her dieing Poe...
