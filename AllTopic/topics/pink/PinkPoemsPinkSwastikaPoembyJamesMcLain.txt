This Jesus thing,
anti-gay,
Uganda, Arizona,
discrimination you feel.
Florida's
jeb Bush laws,
sex offenders
that live beneath
bridges.
Tied to U.S.
the west they once saw.
Living in caves
treating each other
like Hitler did.
And who could have
thunk
that hearing about some crime
five minutes hence
made it more dangerous
than not hearing of such
ignorance now.
It takes decades
to educate all our children
and mere minutes to sign laws
that send us back to the
stone age.
