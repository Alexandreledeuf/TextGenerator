There was an old saying a long time ago
When your life was at a place
That was absolutely perfect
No unhappiness could you trace
Perhaps you had fallen madly in love
For the very first time
Your search was now over
No one else would you find
But you were on a pink cloud
Be cautious you were told
This was uncertain happiness
The kind you never will hold
And then, guess what happened
My poor unsuspecting friend
It was like a swift river
That flowed â€˜round the bend
Your pink cloud grew very thin
Your ears were ringing so loud
And like a bubble that burst
You fell off your pink cloud!
