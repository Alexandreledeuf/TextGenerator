I wish the rain pours out today
Like the way it did on a summer day,
Cold as it was, dark as it can be,
I will not fear a thing cause your with me.
I hope to see the sky tonight,
When the moon and the stars are bright.
I'll lay my soul and mind at ease,
With thoughts of you my heart's at peace.
I've prayed that tomorrow, I will see you,
When you finally have your dreams come true,
When sorrows and tears are only yesterday,
And the pink moon grandly rising up in May.
I wished to be a wind, to fly you away,
Yet there's nothing I can do, If you want to stay,
You may not understand just how I feel,
But I want you to know that I am real.
