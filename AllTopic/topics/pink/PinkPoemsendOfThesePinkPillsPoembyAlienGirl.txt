It was hard daddy
Getting off of these pills
I took it out on the cat
He’s hiding under the bed
I took it out on my husband
But that was really no different
I took it out on my body
It hurts most when I'm still
I took it out on the waitress
I'm sorry about that
I took it out on the streets
And the freeway going home
I took it out on the neighbor
He really didn’t deserve it
I took it out on the little girl
Who stared up at me wide eyed and scared
I took it out on my friends
And now I cant seem to find them
I took it out on that dish
Watched it shatter and fall
I took it out on the world
Seeking some sort of revenge
And I took it out on my love
By pushing him away
And now?
You may ask…
Well I’m still here aren’t I?
