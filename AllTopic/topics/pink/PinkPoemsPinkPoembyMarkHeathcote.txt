At night I think pink looks depressing…
Like a school girls lumpy blancmange
There is something churlish un-exotic
Unless it's of, the most vibrant - colour.
Pink is a misrepresenting, camouflage—
Pink dressing worn is quite un-erotic
At night I think pink looks gruelling…
And on any given dull day, quite dour
Very much not representing,
Springs first cherry blossom flower.
