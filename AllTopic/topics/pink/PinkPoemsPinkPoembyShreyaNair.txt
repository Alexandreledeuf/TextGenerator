Torn, slapped stamped and burned
How far will you suffer girl?
Why do you cover the scratches and wounds that still bleed?
Why long sleeved covered dresses and that fake smile you wield.
Are you afraid of the comments of revealing?
Then why was a little girl went through all that nasty dealings?
All those beautiful relationships, has it gone stale?
Her life was nothing but a fairytale,
Cinderella, Rupunzel and snow white
Why do they leave her side every night?
Did she reveal too much? , I know what you do
You pretend all the hurt inside you
You smile as if it doesn’t hurt,
When all that pain inside you are ready to spurt.
Why are there smeared tearstains at the dawn?
Why can’t there be smiles instead of mourn?
Why are so many questions unanswered?
Why are there melancholies blurted?
Who are they? Woman or witches?
Considering so many gasping stitches!
You should’ve stood up
Should’ve run!
It’s hard to forget
With a lifetime to regret
