Like a beautiful pink rose
She is in prime to bulldoze
Where ever she goes
Is well taken by those
Who know the grace and spirit
Which is ready to establish writ
By being always fit
With full force she can hit
Sublimity is her grace
Which determines her race
She has the graceful pace
Innocence plays on her face
I am victim just to see
Only on love plea
Where ever I happen to be
I am lost she is she
