The emo in pink
She tries to hide
How she really feels
The guy she loves
Won't give her a chance
She feels crushed
Sad, alone, angry
She wants to cry
She wants to know why
She can't have a chance
A single chance
To love him
To be with him
To hold him
To be loved
To be held
The emo in pink
Is misunderstood
Nobody understands
Why she cries
In a corner
Away from the world
He approaches her
To find out
She refuses to tell him
He won't understand
That she wants to be more than his friend
'I can't say'
Is her answer
He looks at her with a puzzled look
'Why not? '
She cried more
'You won't understand'
'I won't if you don't say'
She took a deep breath
And told him straight out
'I love you
But you won't give me a chance
I want to be more than friends'
He finally said
'I do like you
But only as a friend'
He walked away
His words ran through her head
The rest of the day
The emo in pink
Couldn't take it anymore
She knew he'd find another girl
Before he gave her a chance
So she figured she'd save him the trouble
And be away from him
He won't have to hear her say
'I love you' or
'I want to be more than friends'
He wouldn't care
If he ever heard her again
And she'd save herself the trouble
And forever end her suffering
She saw a blade
Nobody to stop her
The blade close to her wrist
She couldn't do it...
She was too scared
She needed a new plan
So she took a walk
To figure it out
It was dark
Too dark for anyone to see
Too dark to see the bright pink she wore
She was crossing the street
And a car came out of nowhere
Didn't see her
Until it was too late
She was dead
She got her wish
She no longer suffered
He found out
And screamed 'WHY?
How could this happen?
I never told her
How I really feel
I said I only wanted to be friends
But was too scared to say
I loved her
I really loved her
I wish i told her the truth'
He saw a knife in his reach
He glanced at it
Picked it up
Whispered the words
'I love you'
And bled to his death
He was found later
With a note beside him
It said
'I regret telling her
Telling her that I'd rather be friends
In case I don't see her in heaven
I wrote this note
Just to say
I love you'
