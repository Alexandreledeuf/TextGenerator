A posy of pink roses
stand on the alter of my church.
The roses maybe artificial,
but it is what they represent.
There is always a welcome
for anyone visiting here.
They can come to the church for guidance
or comfort there.
They may come from everywhere
and the door is always open
to welcome you inside.
They can pray a bit,
reaching out to our Lord,
or they can come in for a chat
about what is troubling them.
For whatever reason they come
the door is always open
with posy of pink roses on the alter
as sign they are welcome there.
