How am I supposed to be myself, Daddy
When you want me to be someone else?
How am I supposed to act like nothing fazes me, Daddy
When you're the one that breaks me down?
How am I supposed to be strong, Daddy
When you're the one that makes me weak?
How am I supposed to love, Daddy
If you're the one that teaches me to hate?
How am I supposed to care, Daddy
If you dont even care at all?
How am I supposed to spread my wings and fly, Daddy
If you keep me in this cage?
How am I supposed to leave, Daddy
If you never let me go?
Tell me,
Daddy......
How?
