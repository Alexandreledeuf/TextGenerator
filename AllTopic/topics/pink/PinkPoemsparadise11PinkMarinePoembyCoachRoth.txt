The ex-Marine walked
into Coach’s bar…
260 pounds…
most of it still muscle…
But what really caught
your eye was his pink dress,
high heels, beaded clutch purse,
and Pippi Longstocking pigtails…
Oh yeah, the five o’clock shadow.
Ordered a beer and barely
drank it before two young men
started making snide remarks…
A fight was brewing…
Coach laid down the law…
Everyone drinks their drinks
and keeps their comments
to themselves or they were out.
The marine couldn’t leave it….
Pulled out his driver’s license
to prove he was legally female
and wanted to be treated as such…
That was fine with Coach…
Everyone was equal in his eyes,
But “last time you were here,
you got belligerent, and that
won’t fly…”
“I’ve never been here before.”
“Well that’s where you lose it,
Cause you were here last week
and I don’t think I’m confusing
you with someone else.”
Beligerent again…threatened
the young men and Coach…
Coach caught him off balance
in his high heeled shoes
and took him to the door
where he/she went into a crouch
and said he was trained
in the martial arts…
Coach backed him out
on Sunset Boulevard…
Horns honking, people hooting…
Maria grabbed Coach’s arm
And he shook it off
“Don’t ever grab me in a fight.”
Her feelings were hurt…
“Jeez, Maria…he may
Be wearing a dress,
But he’s 260 pounds of pink…
You could get me hurt.”
The ex-marine...'I killed
gooks in Nam, and I'll
kill you...'
Now Maria was pissed,
she didn't tolerate racism...
Stepping in front of Coach
'You ought to be ashamed...'
The tall pink lady backed
down the street yelling obscenities...
A month later in the O.J. trial
Deputies had to clear the
Ex-marine from the courtroom…
Same pigtails and high heels…
Different dress…
Coach “He looks good in green.”
