A dainty little girl skipped across the park
Dressed in pink from ribbons to shoes
Her Mother followed close behind
Not many people cast a glance at them
All were busy with their own wards
There was however a man in a wheelchair
Who seemed completely fascinated with her
His eyes were focussed on her intently
His attendant did not appear to notice
That a sense of calm had descended on him
There was even a hint of a smile on his troubled face
'Alisha' – he finally shouted to everyone’s surprise
For he had not uttered a word in years
Now he was calling his young daughter long dead
In a fatal accident along with her mother and brother
He, the father managed to survive or just about
For he was crippled and he had lost his speech
But the little girl in pink seemed to have changed that
She reminded him of his very own child and the fact
That she turned around and gave him a big angelic smile
Only convinced him further that there was life after death
That Alisha was reborn in a new family, was a happy thought
Much later he did comment that – it was the power of pink
That changed his life on that fateful day in the park.
