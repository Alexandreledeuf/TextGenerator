I love every single color of roses
The gardeners have created
Beauty of a rose certainly
Cannot be understated
Reds are bright or a deep color
Yellow the color of the sun
And lavender roses are special
And I find them so much fun
Orange roses are captivating
So many shades of them all
Some roses are bushes
And long-stemmed are very tall
Multi-colored roses so lovely
You just can not get enough
You can cut them for bouquets
For their stems are very tough
The fragrance, oh the fragrance
Is virtually hard to express
Almost a phenomenon
Just part of nature I guess
But the rose most special to me
Youâ€™ll find in poetry or prose
And that is my very favorite
Loveliest of all, the pink rose!
