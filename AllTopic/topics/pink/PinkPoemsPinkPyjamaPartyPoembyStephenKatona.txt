Now what would you think,
Of a party all pink,
With pink iguanas,
Dressed in pink pyjamas?
Guests as big as an elephant,
Their size quite irrelevant,
As long as they've the right hue,
Just remember dyes are taboo.
Their skin must be real,
To join in our meal.
The frogs can eat slugs,
And all kinds of bugs,
Like the dragon millipede,
Which is dangerous indeed.
Would it be so shocking,
When flamingoes come flocking?
Do you think I'm shallow,
To eat only marshmallow?
We'll set you a place,
If you have a pink face.
'I think, ' said a dolphin called pinky,
'This is all rather stinky.
We may look quite bizarre,
But colour is not who we are.
Our skin is only one part,
Look at others hearts,
And get to know their minds,
Then you'll find,
That it's best to be kind.
Tell everyone alive,
They can just arrive,
With their own sort of jive.
The more different their dance,
The better to enhance.
Teach us something new,
Follow a different avenue.
What might seem strange,
Can help us to change.
A party for all,
Would be a ball.'
