The wind of change
Blows through our days
Sometimes can leave
Our minds with haze
When thinks do not
Go as expected
It is easy to feel
Quite dejected
If we live
With love inside
And never faith
We compromise
We can bring
Our dreams to reality
Transform that haze
Into clarity
Wind of change
Can be uplifting
Promising
And also gifting
A chance for
Love and new beginnings
When you believe
You end up winning
