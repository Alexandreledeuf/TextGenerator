Why do people change?
What is the problem with being yourself?
Are you scared of ruining your image?
Is that more important?
Why do people change?
Can’t they just be themselves?
Why do they go away?
Do they think they’re cool because they wear the same jeans?
Why do people change?
Can’t the world just stay the same?
Who cares if you hair isn’t straight?
Who cares if your mouth isn't always open?
Why do people change?
Why do people hide under a mask?
Are they afraid they won't be accepted anymore?
Who do people shun others who are unlike?
Why do people change?
Is the change for the good of the world?
Or is it for the need to feel wanted?
Why do people feel they aren't good enough?
Are you?
Will you change?
