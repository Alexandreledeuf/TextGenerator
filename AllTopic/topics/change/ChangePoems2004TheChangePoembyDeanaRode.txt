It's creeping slowly into my blood
This feeling of desolation and madness
Swirling inside my voids when I look at you
Confused as to why my mind is fantasizing
Why my body is materializing
Why my emotions are stabilizing...
Has this been here all along or just began?
Have I always longed for you or only now?
Did I wish for this forever or did it start today?
Was I supposed to take this forbidden step over you
Make that fateful choice into the unknown
Open myself to breaking completely again
With you I have no ideas
No where to run to
No place to hide...
So maybe I'll just lay my head on your shoulder
Or whisper that I'm looking at you
In a light that only now appeared to my eyes
And it's beautiful.
