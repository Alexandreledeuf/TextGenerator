Oh my it’s blistering hot. please, please stop.
I feel like I’m standing over a steaming pot.
Beads of sweat pouring down my face,
Inopportune times embarrassing place.
I’m fed up with this inward inferno.
Burning, burning from the inside out.
Wake  during the night soaking wet.
listless, tired, out of bed I get
How long will it last,10 years you say,
Oh no Lord, take this misery away.
Good news, good news, help on the way,
Books and products line the shelves today.
I sit and ponder about the women of yesteryear.
Why the mental institutions kept them there.
Menopause, a change of life,
educate yourself, eliminate the strife.
