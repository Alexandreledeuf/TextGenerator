I love the way you talk to anyone, do you have to talk to her
I love the way you love animals, you know I’m allergic to fur
I love the way you are different, you’re not going out in that hat
I love the way you dance, do you have to embarrass me like that
I love the way you are well read, you gonna waste money on that book
I love the way you think I’m beautiful, why’d you give me that leering look
I love the way you’ll help anyone, bet it’s just to fuel your ego
I love the way you’re spontaneous, this isn’t where I wanted to go
I love the way I fill you with desire, I told you I’m not in the mood
I love the way you’re relaxed about your body, do you really need all that food
I love the way you are still fun, do you really need that toy
I love the way you still act young, sometimes you’re like a little boy
I love the way you collect me from work, isn’t it time you got a new car
I love the way I feel natural around you, stop looking while I’m only in my bra
I love the way you always have a smile, why’d you have to wear that silly grin
I love that you just let yourself go, do you really have to try to sing
And if you keep on with that annoying laugh I don’t think I’ll last another day
I’m so glad we met ‘cos I think that you’re perfect … why you walking away?
