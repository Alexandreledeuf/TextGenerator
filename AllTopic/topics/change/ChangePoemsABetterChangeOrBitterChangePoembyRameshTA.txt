A change is what everybody dreams and wants to see
The change we see – is it better or bad? It’s the question!
Every morning the colourful Sun rise is beautiful to see!
The singing birds inspire us to be free and happy in life!
The jolly good squirrels kindle us too to play as they do!
We can see crows and sparrows all around our houses!
We see beautiful clouds of colour changes at the Sunset,
Night sky full of countless Stars and Moon shining bright!
All these things are Nature at its best nobody can neglect!
Now those things we cannot see and enjoy anymore so!
Morning and evening twilights are beautifully all right;
Stars and Moon in the night times are as usual perfect.
But Nature on the Earth has changed without any doubt!
Farming lands have turned into Satellite towns around town;
Crows, sparrows have disappeared with the destruction of trees!
Farmers have come to towns to work as masons and mill workers;
Population, traffic, pollution have increased with food grain price!
Money is not enough to buy all people need as rain in summer!
Men drink and talk themselves and lie on the pavements;
At night it is common they sleep where dogs and pigs frequent;
All have become one according to socialism politics advocates!
Swine flu, bird flu and SARS are spreading the entire world now!
And Stars and Moon wink eyes at this big farce of society so!
