i walk in clothes you don't like,
i hangout with friends you don't like,
why can't you just excpet the way i am,
i can't not change, its who i am,
this is who i am,
the person i am growing up to be,
don't you understand,
i am who i want to be,
can't you just let it go,
because this is who i am,
you can't change a thing.
you let her walk in skimpy clothes,
when all i want to wear is black,
she goes and dates older men,
when i only date guys my age and you still won't let it go.
you don't have to worry,
don't you want me to be happy?
if you do then let it be.
this is who i am,
the person i am growing up to be,
don't you understand,
i am who i want to be,
can't you just let it go,
because this is who i am,
you can't change a thing.
