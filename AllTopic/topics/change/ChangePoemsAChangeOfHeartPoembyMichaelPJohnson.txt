I'm full of joy and richly blessed
Of Christ I'm never shy
I'll journey through this world as guest
Until the day I die
Though old, grey near worldly dead
The grave my flesh may see
But souls who've eaten Heaven's Bread
Will rise complete and free
Free of sin of eternal wrath
Free through innocent blood
Free to travel Christ's trodden path
And live the way I should
It's not too late to change your ways
Seek Jesus' help on high
Fix on Him your fervent gaze
Or least of all to try
For God can see a troubled soul
The heart of those still blind
Seeking someone to make them whole
Searching for peace of mind
God sees the filth that keeps us bound
Lost, through satanic lies
He sees who seek the higher ground
In righteousness to rise
He sees who kill, rape, cheat, connive
Deceivers greedy for gain
Liars, thieves believing to thrive
Hoping with Christ to reign
Only who turn to live anew
Washed clean in Heaven's Flame
As virgin bride God's chosen few
Receive The Bride-Groom's name......
