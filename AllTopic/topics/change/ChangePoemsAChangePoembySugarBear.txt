Sometimes I wake up hating the world
Caring for no one in it
Doing only what stress reviled
And ignoring what isn’t
Pain flows through my body
Quite often, frequently
Sulking becomes a hobby
And draws attention to me unpleasantly
Regretting my decisions
Wishing I were someone else
Somebody with vision
Anyone but myself
Hating everything about me
Wishing I were done
Leave my past behind me
And just, run
Hiding forever behind every tree
So I blend in with the shadows
Enabling you to see
How I scandal
Ripping at my hair
Pinching at my chest
Unable to bare
Till my last breath
Waiting for another place
Of which you can roam
Wishing for a teary face
When I'm gone
I’ll just let you know
You have no idea
The things I wish to let go
Are STILL right here
