There is a wistfulness in the breeze
That caresses my hair
And the warmth of the autumn sun
Stirs a longing in my soul -
Where did the time go?
I recall days of endless wonder
Never at a loss for adventure
Experience filled my days
With joy and sorrow -
I never thought it would end;
Now I treasure every moment
Holding them close to my heart
Making deep impressions
To last me through the winter
For spring may never come;
And you will be the one thought
That will carry me through the night
Stay close, my love,
Whisper soft and sweet
The words I'll always remember.
