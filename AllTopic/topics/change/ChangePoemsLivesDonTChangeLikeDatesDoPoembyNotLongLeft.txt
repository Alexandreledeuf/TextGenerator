the fireworks have flown,
the wishes have been welcomed,
the booze has reached the brain,
yet everything still seems the same,
alhtough one year has bid us farewell,
and a new year has arrived.
on the acid crystal drops of the rain.
a heavy head greets my morning,
just as it has always done,
as sure as the sky and the sun,
The coffee still tastes as bitter as i,
like it did last year,
and the year before,
the Car refuses to wake from its mechanical sleep,
the Radio showers my ears with static,
just as it did last year.
the date may have changed,
but life's enduring pains,
simply move with the years
