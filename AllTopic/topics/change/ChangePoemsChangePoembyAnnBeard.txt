Our world forever changes every second every day.
Nothing halts the pass of time; old age will have its way.
each mighty cliff or ancient tree will suffer the same fate
life seems just an experiment, a transitory state.
The planet earth its fertile soil, the mysteries of heaven,
all forever changing in more ways  known to man.
From the wonder of first breath to surrender of the last,
Time becomes the enemy devours all moments past.
Nothing is more fragile than the spirit of mankind,
as good and evil battle in each subconscious mind.
change is hardly noticed until friends or lover’s die,
then we weep and fear mortality while we say goodbye.
Change has made us who we are, a visitor, a guest
we dine on nature’s beauty babies suckle at the breast.
A child will learn and grow maybe someday take my place
But In very different world, for I alone lived in this space.
