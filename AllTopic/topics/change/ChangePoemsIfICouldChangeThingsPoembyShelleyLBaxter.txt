I am at a loss, for the words to say,
for the pain you feel today.
I know this loss is harder then,
most difficult times along lifes way.
For if I could change things
please know I surely would...
for this great Man your grieving for,
the woman you called Dad; grandpa,
will remain in your hearts for good.
He is not really gone...
keep him alive in your memory,
til you meet again, many years from now,
in another land, a better place, In heaven.
