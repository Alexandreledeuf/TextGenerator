So life has handed you  sour grapes,
They're bitter and hard to swallow -
But you'll be just fine
Sour grapes make good wine
If you throw in enough sweet sugar;
So lemons are the fruit of the day,
So sour your lips start to pucker -
Just make lemonade
A tall glass in the shade
Will refresh on a hot summer day;
So your garden has grown green tomatoes,
That just won't turn red in the sun -
Fry them up in a pan
Make some relish to can
What a wonderful change of taste!
Whenever life throws you a curve ball
When you were expecting a hit -
Then you should be guessin'
You're learning a lesson................................
It's time for a change of scenery.
