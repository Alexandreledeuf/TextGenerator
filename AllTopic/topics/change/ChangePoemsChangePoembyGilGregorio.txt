It is a perilous venture to an unknown
where the living world is limitless
like weeds from a faraway land
dreaming...and hoping...
It is a desert where the woes tremble
like a torch's sparkle at night
and the origin is not known yet
chanting...and lifting...
But, it has wings that can endure
even swallow those that are bigger;
It has eyes that can examine
even those who do not deserve it.
Most of all, it begins everything new!
