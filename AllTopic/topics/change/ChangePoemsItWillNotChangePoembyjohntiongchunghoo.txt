why change
after so long
we had thought
we have been made
for each other?
yes, you can go
to your new heart
i will beat my old one
the path you walk
i pray will be strewn
with roses
the ones
you sent
at the first valentine
you got me
my heart
i would have done
anything for you
for your happiness
why change?
if it is that is what you have chosen
with full blessing
i let you walk your path
but remember
my love still accompanies
each of your steps
my tears
each of my fingers
inspired by
'It Will Not Change'
It will not change now
After so many years;
Life has not broken it
With parting or tears;
Death will not alter it,
It will live on
In all my songs for you
When I am gone.
Sarah Teasdale
