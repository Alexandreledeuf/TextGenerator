Change,
When change comes, it should enlighten the eye
Change is sometimes painful and especially when
without warning,
Leaving one wondering and questioning just why?
Regarding of the nature of a matter, in time change shall surely come
Most of the times there's a significant  purpose in change,
A long tough battle won.
