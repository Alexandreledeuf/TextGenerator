There was a sound upon the wind
A joyous melody
Which sang a tune of gratitude
Spiced with a hint of glee
It whispered with the breath of spring
Come to empower soul
For all who cared to listen to
Its satisfying toll
Sweet as bells on Sunday
Announcing heavens berth
Sailing past on golden rays
To sing of Peace on Earth
Angelic annotation
Delivered with the rain
Transported via rainbows
Has set us free again
With just one noteâ€¦
