Thoughts broke down from my dreams demise
As I shut my dreaming eyes
Stars flickered out
My wish lost truth
As I cried in a phone booth
The string untied
Memories faded away
I cried all night and I cried all day
Missing you
And you haven't even left me
Missing who
You used to be
I'm missing you
And I wish
That you'd leave me,
Just wish
That you'd leave me alone
Knowledge broke through
Hope lost touch
I cried too much
Just thinking of you
The pain came down
My smile turned to frown
And I wish I could walk away
I just with that I could walk away
Missing you
And you haven't even left me
Missing who
You used to be
I'm missing you
And I wish
That you'd leave me,
Just wish
That you'd leave me alone
