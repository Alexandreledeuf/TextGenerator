The Autumn morn' awakes
leaves vibrantly cloth himself
taking chance upon winds
searching for new
breath
In the journey unto
the winds of chance
each touch
then flow apart
then touch again
Yet in each touch
something new
something old
something peculiar
never the same
Each time the winds of chance
blows a leaf
from it's branch
has a dance
then takes it's prance
life has a kiss....
