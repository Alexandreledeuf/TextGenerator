I wish it would change.
The urge to cut my self.
I wish it would change.
This pain that is felt.
I wish it would change.
So i write it all down.
I wish it would change.
Wearing my blank lifeless frown.
I wish it would change.
Crying everyday.
I wish it would change.
Not having any thing to say.
I wish it would change.
So I don't have to write poems.
I wish it would change.
And wish everbody knew them.
I wish it would change.
I'm just trying to fight it.
I wish it would change.
Everyday trying to hide it.
I wish it would change.
My sorrow, My pain.
I wish it would change.
It's getting worst everday.
