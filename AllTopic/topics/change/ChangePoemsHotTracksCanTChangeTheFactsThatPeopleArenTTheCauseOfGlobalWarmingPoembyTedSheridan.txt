Today the summer sun beats down on me like it did when I was back in Nam
Making me crazy with a touch of the malaria......making me
mad enough to overreact to the slightest breeze
exhaled from the painted lips of a one legged diseased ridden concubine
Like the one that cleaned the hooch when I was back in Nam.....
She had a way of setting me off....flapping those lips....kind of like Madonna does.....
With all her Al Gore Global warming crap....
If she wanted to truly save the planet....she'd close her mouth and legs.....
