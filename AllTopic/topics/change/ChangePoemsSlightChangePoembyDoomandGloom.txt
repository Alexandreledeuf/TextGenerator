Broken indifference, traded for a whisper of defiance
A marginal decline in the pressure applied
Freedom, a memory enhanced with a casing of non truth
Equality, the right to die extended to all
Raise your voice and lift your glass
sip the poison of the past
Union tyranny, sweetened with conformity
A blend compelling, to the core of your ignorance
Cease now your flamboyant posturing and pause
Enchant me with chains in the name of your cause
Sleepless nights I offer to you
