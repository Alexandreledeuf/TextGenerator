Change my heart O God
Make me a righteous person like You
Change my mind O God
Let me think wise in everything I do
Change my eyes O God
Give me a sight to see the light in You
Change my hands O God
Make me a fisher of man for You
Change my feet O God
Make me walk upright like You
Change my lips O God
And let me speak Your word of truth
Come and cleanse me O God
Make me whiter than the December snow
Come and forgive me O God
For all the wrong things I’ve done, and the lie words I’ve told
