On a lazy Sunday afternoon,
the sun shone so brightly...
appearing like a large blazing
iridescent quarter.
.
Hovering over the quiet city,
the glowing sphere gave so much,
life to the dull muted blue sky,
so much warmth-and promise!
To the old woman whose body
earlier had been aching...
and whose mind was sluggish...
this was just what she needed.
The sun and the feeling that summer
was arriving soon whisked away
the memory of her 'Winter' days,
suspended in mid-air-it gave her Joy!
While Glistening into the windows
of her tired and weary soul...
she stood up in one brisk move
on the rickety weathered balconey.
Although Her perennials had not yet
surfaced, Myra began removing foliage
from her cracked chipped window box...
all while smiling and singing happily.
Taking it all in...breathing deeply,
yet softly, the old woman  realized,
she had made it through again,
another year passed-without her late friend.
