i set in this house away frim everything
clearing my head from everything at home
and the rest of my life
looking at everything i have done and i'm doing now
somethings i wish i could change something i don't
knowing nothing can be i have to deal with it
deal with the choices i have made
but i can from here on out
NO!
i will, i will change
change everything about me
they all will seea new me forever
good bye to the old and hello to the new
