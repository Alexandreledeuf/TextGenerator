Change is hard
i try to change
Sorry im such a disapointment
I show great deplore
Couldn't live up to your excpectations
I try to change for the nation
Even tried consultation
there is no short cut
Gotta take the long road
So your probably fed-up
my heart has been cut up
there isn't much more i can do
tried everything for you
thats cause change is hard
feels like i've been hung out to dry
In front of a hundred eyes
I do try
but thats not enough
not enough for change
