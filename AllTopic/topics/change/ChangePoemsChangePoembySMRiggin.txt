you have changed
and it's not for the better
all of the sudden
your different
and it's no good.
What's with you lately
I know you want to fit in
or impress a girl
but please dont change. not for her.
Standing from the outside I can see it.
you're different, not the same,
I'm not too sure about this new person
please change back.
