White caped waves
In the curl of the sea
Smell of the ocean air
On the white sandy beach.
Colors of the sky
Roaring of the sea
Walking in the wet sand
With my hair blowing in the breeze.
Rolling of the waves
splashing on the beach
Seagulls flying over
In the roaring sea.
Reflections from the sun
Casting colors upon the sea
splashing of the waves
that roll under my feet.
