You are the ocean, endless
I am but a tiny grain of sand
After being bathed countless times
By your great tides
Still wait for
Another countless baths.
Each tide
Like a dream
Attracts me to its heart
But, every time
I am thrown back
To the shore of day's reality.
My soul expands
To billions and billions sandgrains
Uniting with them
I become the sea-shore
Then I take your endlessness
In my embrace.
