The pulsing sound
of moving sea;
The ocean surf-
tranquility!
An ocean breeze-
With sunset's glaze;
Seaoats in view-
and ocean waves!
An endless flow-
of sand and shells;
Ebbed back and forth-
by ocean swells!
The flight of gulls-
along the shore;
A fleeing sand crab-
in sand to bore!
The seashore is special-
a great place to be;
God's love abounds-
down by the sea!
