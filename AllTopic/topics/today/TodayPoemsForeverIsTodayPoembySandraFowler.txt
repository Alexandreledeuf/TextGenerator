An Easter flower cuts light into the sill
The sound of suffering is forever still.
Tears of forgiveness warm the evening chill.
I hear His whisper in a rustling leaf,
'I would have been so lonely in my grief,
Without your fragile friendship, my good thief.
You did not scorn the pity of My frame,
But saw the Jesus in Me just the same,
I call you Friend, you need no other name.
My Father's house is just a breath away.
See. one by one the windows light our way.
I think He was expecting us today.'
Beyond the drama of earth's dying skies,
Joy is too powerful for human eyes.
Forever is today in Paradise.
For my dear friend, Ralph Russell who often requested this poem to be read at Easter.
