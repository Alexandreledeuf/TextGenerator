What ails the modern world’s community?
Men live without peace, love and harmony;
The root cause of all evils is money;
Human life has lost its bare dignity.
Human labor has become very cheap;
Forgotten is the brotherhood of nations;
Humanity survives on small rations;
Prices of commodities are all steep.
Richer nations accrue wealth, keeping fine;
Scarcity of things is wholly manmade;
Most people live below poverty-line;
Poor nations survive just on World Bank’s aid!
Who will to reset the world into order?
When every man truly loves his neighbor!
