Believing in
more of who
I am today
than yesterday.
Savoring
all of what
in life
I have to gain.
Feeling
in the depth
of my weary soul,
inner desires
rising as my life,
I begin to reclaim.
Accepting
my fate
as I cling
to my faith.
I now see
hints of sun
where there
is rain.
I now sense
traces of joy
emerging from
beneath profound
pain.
Brightness
outside of
darkness,
I now witness.
Inside of
bitterness,
I now taste
sweetness.
I hold more
in the palms
of my hands
today than
ever before.
For now, I
dance solo
in my
frenzied
life tango.
But it is okay
because I am
stronger today
than yesterday.
