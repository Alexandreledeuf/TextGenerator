(inspired by John Latham's art, 'The N-U Niddrie Heart')
I  awoke in a stream of rays,
laid my Pregnant Survivorâ€™s Manual
on the edge of the rug,
gave it a quick tug.
At the other end
I placed my book of Vanished Species,
then squatted in between,
gave myself a hug
and felt just like today.
