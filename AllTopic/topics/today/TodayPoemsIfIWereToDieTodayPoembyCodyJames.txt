If I were to die today...
Forever im my heart your love would stay.
Through my mind your memories would flow.
Wishing I could hold you and never let you go.
I Would remember your voice and laughter
Many years after.
I would gaze upon you everyday from the heaves above.
Just to feel your heart with all of my love.
