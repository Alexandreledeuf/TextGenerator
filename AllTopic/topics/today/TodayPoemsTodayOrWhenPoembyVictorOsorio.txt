Test inscribe on sheets of trees
Images scanning
Unexisting eyes
Pudding taste
From snow white
The door is closed
The phone is broken
She's the unborn
Yesterday spelled her name
Today or when-torn
Screaming at the flame
Of the one year candle
Missed you, dreamed you
Lost you, can't handle
Today or when-born
Light peeks fading cloud
Twist of fate lifted the ground
Changes-music is loud
Today or when-should abound.
