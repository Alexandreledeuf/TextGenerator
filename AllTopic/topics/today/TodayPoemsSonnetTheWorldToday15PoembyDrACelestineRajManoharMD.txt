Lo, when I see a new obituary,
Untimed demise of one of great repute;
Or a sad man's Auto-biography,
A family- feud due to a land dispute.
And when I hear news of a robbery,
A cold-blooded murder in broad daylight;
An act of rape or of adultery;
of two Brothers who had a silly fight!
The kidnap-story of a doctor's child,
A necklace snatched at point of knife in light;
The rampage of animals from the wild,
I curse this world with all my lingual might.
'Tis sad how men have turned a world so nice
Into a den of fear and grief and vice.
