Today I looked at you
Studied every angle of your face
Your nose, your eyelashes, your mouth
I tried to engrave every inch of you into my mind
So I would not forget a single detail
I drank you in as you stood before me
Appearing completely oblivious of my stealing your essence
As I knew I would not see you
For a while
