Searching through the attic
I was completely caught off guard
when the sudden flood of memories
were found inside a card.
The card was sent to you.
It had an air of 'young and sweet'.
You were still in my belly
and I feared we'd never meet.
The doctors warned of danger
so I prayed like none before.
I prayed you would be healthy
for me to just adore.
They put me up on bedrest
and said to ''Just stay put! ''
I couldn't leave the bedroom...
not even just a foot.
The months dragged by so slowly
but it was worth the wait.
They worried you wouldn't weigh 5 lbs
but you weighed nearly 8!
My one and only son.
No more babies for me.
I read the card I found today
and cried so joyously.
My visit to the attic
has renewed my faith in Him.
I felt my heart still glowing
as the attic lights went dim.
