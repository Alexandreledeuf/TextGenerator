The world around look so topsy-turvy!
Nothing is permanent or ultimate;
Gone are the days of dropsy and scurvy;
Now people think they can all levitate.
And politics invades all other fields;
Most nations are riddled by corruption;
Black-money, clout and ‘goondas’ power wields;
Nothing happens by mere assumption.
Red-tapism has people on their knees;
Professionals have been much humbled oft;
Both individuals and nations have no peace;
To acts of injustice, God appears soft!
O God, when will an order new set in?
When will all earthlings shun away from sin?
