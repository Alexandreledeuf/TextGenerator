Today is the day for finding things again.
Tom Tiddler gives out pennies in his grove
And Ali Baba comes out from his den;
The world’s becoming one wide treasure trove!
There is no end until the last Amen.
Vienna’s woods hide many secrets, and
In paintings Henry Koerner gave us clues,
The quarries overgrown with trees and sand,
His parents walking side by side, the views
Of two receding figures hand in hand.
They’ll not return, but paintings that he took
Us to admire, the glorious, goldlit Klimt,
Hanging for all upon its brazen hook
With every dazzling curve and angle crimped,
Returns so the unquiet slain can close their book.
And three years after burial is found
The salt cup I desired all my life:
Cellini’s golden sculpture double crowned…
The gods of sea and earth, of man and wife,
Their feet entwined one to the other bound.
A Rembrandt surfaced with a telling tale
Of greed, her collar changed from cloth to fur;
With time the truth will out, and will not fail
To prick our conscience though we may prefer
To say we’re owners of some Holy Grail.
A Michelangelo, a Rubens in the fray,
A Donatello, under layered paint,
All are discovered on this Finding Day
As if God’s face turned back, without restraint
Smiling and handing us his great bouquet
Of blossoms blooming on our sleeping street
Singing a song renewing an old prayer:
Arise my love!  Let fly your earthbound feet,
Be like the petals on the flowering pear
And sing Amen!  The cycle is complete!
