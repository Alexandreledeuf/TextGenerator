i am the hoodie you pass on the street
i am the one you dread to meet
i am the one in the park
i am the one who stands outside in the dark
i am the one who stands in a gang
i am the one you look at when you hear a bang
i am the drunken youth
i am the binge drinking culture thats so uncouth
i am the thing you detest
while i sit here distressed
about all the exams i have to complete
and all the sport events in which i have to compete
the duke of edinburghs expedition
but all you see is my hooded disposition
i am the one stood out side your local shop
i am your next local cop
