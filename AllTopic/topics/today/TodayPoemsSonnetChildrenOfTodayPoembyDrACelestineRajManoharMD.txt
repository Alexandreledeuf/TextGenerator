The family norm is small and risks are high;
The busy parents pamper, pet and spoil;
The children never knowing truly why;
They fret and fume and burn the midnight-oil.
And children too are never satisfied;
Fast foods, bad lifestyles make them ill and weak;
In parental guidance, they donâ€™t abide;
And help of God, they never seem to seek,
The modern child wishes to be on own;
And in the process, blunders so often;
To elderly advice, it seems to frown;
And lands in vices, amidst evil men.
If parents are not strict to rear a child,
It grows to be a flower in the wild.
