“In the past those whom you love
................don’t ever die.”
....From “Vertumnus”, a poem
...........by Joseph Brodsky
...............dough bowl
.holding fresh-picked flowers
.....captured surplus of blue
..........Grandma’s hands
...kneading apple-pie dough
......lingering cinnamon air
....reflections of the season
........seasoned memories
........weathered and worn
...........setting the mood
..............quilted today
