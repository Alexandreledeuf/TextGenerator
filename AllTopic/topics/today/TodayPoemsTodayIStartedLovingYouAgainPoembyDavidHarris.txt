There was a time when
I thought that our love was failing.
Then you got ill and nearly died,
and I found out how a lonely life would be,
so today I started loving you again.
The sun in my life began to shine again,
the roses in our garden even started to bloom,
my life began to lift me higher,
and our home is a battleground no more,
for today, I started loving you again.
Never will I doubt our love again.
We have something so precious;
I would be a fool to let it go.
I now realise the consequences.
So today, I started loving you again.
