People with intact eyes, yet appear blind;
Peop1e with alert ears seem not to hear;
People with intact nose, no sme11 can find;
People with every joy appear to tear.
People are cheats and cheat themselves all life;
People tell lies to men and to themselves;
People well-off, appear to be in strife;
People are bad and appear worse than Elves.
The world is bad and so people turn bad;
The world isnâ€™t true and so people are not;
The world is mad and so people turn mad;
The world's a show and people simply plot.
And people waste their time and waste others';
And people aren't true to their own brothers.
