The world I live in is not good at all;
I rarely find a human being good;
There isn’t a righteous one whom I can call;
The majority lives in evil-hood.
There is no one whom I can depend on;
The place abounds in ‘snakes and jackals’ much;
They move so stealthily by dusk and dawn;
For time being, they have a ‘Midas-touch’!
But things will change for good I do believe;
The evil ones will reap their punishment;
The world and God, one cannot long deceive;
God will usher the day of His Judgment!
And must I lead a file of men with masks?
My precious time is meant for better tasks!
