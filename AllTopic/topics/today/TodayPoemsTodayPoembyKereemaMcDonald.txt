Today is the day I put yesterday out of my mind
Today is the day I take back my heart and soul
Today is the day I put thoughts of you away
Today is the day you’ll become a distant memory to me, I will no longer long  to feel your touch or to be kissed by you
Today is the day I stop wondering how you are doing, if you are happy and how I can make you give that smile that makes my heart skip a beat
Today is the day I take back my life
Today is the day I can say boldly and proudly you are no longer the center of my universe for
Today I’m Over You.
