God has truly blessed me today
I open the door of this house
To let the fresh air in
You are the God of my life
Who may ascend
Meet  God  I will do when he comes
Victory for my God  I will Give
Holy Holy
I truly love my God
God has truly blessed me today
Send my sin away
I will watch the sun going down
I watched when the fields were on fire
Trees burned up in flames
I know God  how great is your love
I canâ€™t get enough of your love God
I found hope on you so I can carry on with my life
I wish you were here God
It has been sunny all day outside
And I keep on praising you today
God has truly blessed me today
I am forever here to stay
I need your touch
I will call upon your name
I will walk on and take the challenge in life
God be merciful to me
Your lovely source of true light
I will love, sing, and wonder
All I can say is thank you God
God has truly blessed me today
Rescue me when I am feeling tired
Holy spirit fall upon me
After the music fades I will sleep well
I will open my eyes
I want to see that light
I will walk in your fields
I hope to see the raindrops falling after the rain
And my life to be as happy as it can be here on earth
God I trust in you
Long live my God
Holy Holy
