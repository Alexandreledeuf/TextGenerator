Two years ago today it was the last time we saw each other
From that day on I never left you side
I looked into your eyes and said it repeatedly I love you
Two years ago today we spent our last Christmas together
So many things that you wanted to do, but you couldn’t do it anymore Because of your condition
We had our last Christmas meal together
This time never seems to fade away from my mind; I still remember it Until today
Two years ago today you died at 1: 55 PM
This was the last hello and the last good bye we said to each other
I had done all the crying I needed
Slowly my pains are getting away
My anger is all gone now
It is easier now to talk about you
To tell you the truth, it doesn’t seem like two years
