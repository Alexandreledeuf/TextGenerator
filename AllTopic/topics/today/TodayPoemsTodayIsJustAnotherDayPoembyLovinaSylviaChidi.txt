Today is just another day
Of highs and lows
When the winds blow and the waters flow
Today is just another day
A day to make amends and new friends
For there will come a time it will all end
Today is just another day
We eat and go to work
Some seat and wait for luck
Others cheat giving the sweet talk
Today is just another day
Where we must live for tomorrow
Or give in to everlasting sorrow
Today is just another day
We breathe in the same air
Trying to invent new ideas
Exhibiting passionate care or fear
Today is just another day
While some of us delight in joy
Others will find a way to deploy
Tools to destroy the moments we enjoy
Today is no different from yesterday
Technology the only change in the game
The people are still the same
Looking for one to take on the blame
Always worshipping those with a name
Broken hearts and love keep alive the dying flame
Today is just another day
It will fade away
Quickly into yesterday
Tomorrow then gladly will become today!
