God, thwart the moves of men with minds insane;
Their corruption has reached enormous heights;
And masking all their crimes, righteous they feign;
Ill-gotten wealth, giving them sleepless nights!
How long this land can bear their insults, Lord?
How longer must the poor suffer hard-ships?
The corrupt own most resources, O God;
Most transactions are carried out by ‘tips’!
The people have been cheated for ages;
The poor are made poorer by corrupt men;
The employees get paid paltry wages.
For honest folk, the earth is no haven!
Most lives are endangered by corruption;
The world does need a cleansing eruption!
