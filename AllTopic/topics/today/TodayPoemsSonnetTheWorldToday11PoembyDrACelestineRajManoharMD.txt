My mind is sick to see the state of things,
That happen here in clumsy manner still!
The selfish acts of men in my ear rings;
Society has become really ill.
There is no justice, fairness anywhere;
All crooks and pimps, drug lords alone will thrive;
Within the home and outside, foul is the air;
Most men, women from sins, most joy derive.
Money, the root of evils has powers;
A state of utter hopelessness prevails;
All seem to want unnatural, false flowers;
And people write not letters send/send e-mails!
It is a show of pomp and vanity!
All forget the road to Eternity.
