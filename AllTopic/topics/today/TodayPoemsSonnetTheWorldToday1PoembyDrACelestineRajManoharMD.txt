Oh, to what has this world come to, these days?
Nations expanding nuclear arsenals!
Terrorists and drug-lords active always!
Bomb culture fast spreading its tentacles!
Global security has been threatened;
Poor nations are suppressed by the rich ones!
The abyss of world trade has been deepened;
They dig the earth to find the soil’s true sons!
Computers have turned one’s life fast-forward!
Robots do much more things, men used to do;
Human beings have become too wayward;
One nation plans the other’s Waterloo!
Money-power rules all facets of life!
With mind’s peace lost, man is in utter strife.
