They strapped them on so long ago
they're now a part of me.
Today they're going to rip them off
and set my poor teeth free!
For oh so long they've hurt me.
They've torn my mouth to bits.
They'll leave me bruised and battered.
It's time to call it quits!
We started this with hopes
to have a normal smile.
Now we end with so much more.
My teeth are ''single filed''!
So straight and bright and pearly white!
I never thought they'd be.
My parents money was well spent....
just look and you will see!
