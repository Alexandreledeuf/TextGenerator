Today she got her license.
She now thinks she's all grown.
I can't believe my baby
can drive to town ALONE.
Although I tried to fight it,
the time kept passing by.
Is it wrong to drag my heals?
You know... I had to try! !
She use to be so small.
It seems like yesterday
when I would watch her sing her songs
and giggle while she'd play.
I have to trust her judgement.
Of course she knows what's right.
I pray God keeps her by His side
even when she's not in sight.
