The modern world’s one main disease is stress!
The kind of life we lead, can most depress;
The policies on health are in a mess;
One man attempts the other to suppress.
The one with lesser talents doth impress;
The modern gadgets make all labor less;
How do you curb population’s excess,
And people gain favors through their largess?
Where is today, the freedom of the press?
Each day, they introduce a newer cess!
Revealing body-parts is now the dress;
That Doomsday’s nigh is but anyone’s guess.
More souls are denied Heaven’s ingress;
The common man, his feelings can’t express.
