I saw her by the bus stop
and she glanced  my way
she gave me such a pretty smile
it took my breath away
I knew I couldn't say hello
the struggle what to do
I'd never know what you were like
a stranger passing through
Do you ever think of me
as I have thought of you
wonder what sights we'd have seen
if we had stopped to view
crazy how the little things
and chances slip away
another one, another life
another day today.
