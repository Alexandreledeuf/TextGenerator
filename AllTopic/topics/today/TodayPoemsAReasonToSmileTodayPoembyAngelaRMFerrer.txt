I saw a reason to smile today
when I saw a butterfly flutter its wings around my way.
I saw a reason to smile today,
when I heard the children laughing and playing
under the warm sun of May.
I saw a reason to smile today,
when I looked up and saw no clouds of gray.
But most of all,
I saw a reason to smile today,
when I saw you pass by, which completed my day.
