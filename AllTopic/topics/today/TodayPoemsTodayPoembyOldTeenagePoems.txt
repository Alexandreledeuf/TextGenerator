But the sun also rises
towards yet another day
And the sun does not fear
Come what may
Because this is a day
of lilies and butterflies
A day of laughter and cheers,
of infinite cries
This is a day
unlike any you've ever seen
It will bring you life,
on this you can lean
This is the day
That will turn your world around
this will be the very
day that you found
Another truth
That shows you why you are you
Today you'll find the importance
of always staying true
This day will be unique
Just like every other.
