Today is the day I bury you
It will be a sad day, oh but then again
every day with you has been
I've been thinking about your eulogy
What will I say?
Will I cry?
Of all the places you could have died
Why in my heart deep inside
It has been a very painful rollercoaster ride
Ive tried more than once to bury you
I kept hanging on trying to convince myself
that you might love me to
Enough is enough so
Today is the day I bury you
