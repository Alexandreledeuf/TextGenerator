Open your eyes and you will see,
Just how beautiful our earth can be.
No animal would ever be rare,
If everyone would try to care.
Trees would not be lying dead,
And all of earth's animals would be fed.
All of the bears would have plenty of honey,
And there would even be carrots for every bunny.
If everyone picked up one piece of trash,
Our litter problem would be gone in a flash.
Tomorrow take a good look at the sky's new dawn,
And realize someday all of this might be gone.
Remember the important part that you play,
In saving our planet for a future day.
Our childrens' eyes with your help will see,
Just how beautiful our earth can be.
