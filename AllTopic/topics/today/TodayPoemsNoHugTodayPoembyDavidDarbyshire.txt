I thought she was here to stay?
but my baby seems to have gone away.
Now, I suppose I won't get my 'Hug',
maybe tomorrow, won't be so grey?
Woke up to a warm, but empty bed,
dreams of hugs, forced in my head.
My arms are sore, from hugging all night,
you should see my pillow, all squeezed tight.
Waited all day, no door bell rang,
I shouted some bad words, all in slang.
Will now go out, onto the street,
And 'HUG' the first person, I met!
