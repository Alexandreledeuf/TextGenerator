I went home today
And it was a big surprise; Buildings got in the way
And made me realize I couldn't stay
Although I tried,
Old Friends could not be found
Like me, they all moved away
Home is not back there
But do you know where?
I went home today and much to my surprise
I found all the memories home inside
For in the heart
is the only place Home will stay
So I went home today
