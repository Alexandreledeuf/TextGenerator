I think I've been in love with you
Since the dawn of love first bloomed
For as long as the wind has whispered words;
Conversing with the moon
I think I'll stay in love with you
For the sake of morning dew
That glimmers, gleams, and glistens bright;
Reminding me of you
I think Iâ€™ll be in love with you
Even when it's not brand new
From today, through every tomorrow
Till it's time to say adieu
