Life is confusing
When your heart is sad;
It is difficult to distinguish
Who your true friends are
And who are merely interlopers
Meddling to step in,
Maneuvering for positions of advantage.
I’d like to go back to a simpler time,
Fill my mind with poetry,
Gaze out into the sunlight
From an afternoon window,
Ride a horse and carriage with you
Until the world was true.
But I’ve been exiled in a cruel country,
Cutting my teeth on the sour fruit
Of dissipating dreams and vanished youth,
My unshaven face has a humble grace
But I do not think you will kiss me today.
