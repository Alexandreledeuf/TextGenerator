Dodgy Dave deserves a break today.
He's writing so fast, his fingers are whittling away.
He just finished his book
and that was all it took.
He's now in the affliction mode.
Spewing out words as he goes.
But that's only a plus for us.
because we get to read, and trust,
that it's the best quality poems in town.
They make and frown turn upside down.
So Dodgy, you deserve a break today.
Put on a tune and let your hips sway.
(Not the sway that put some in dismay)
Relax a bit...kick your feet up
But don't stay away long, we'll miss you to much: O)
