Forget today my tired soul
imagine you never said those destructive words
another person no longer sees your worth
but tomorrow brings a reason to hope
Forget today my tired soul
pretend you hadn't created your own downfall
you've lost the chance to make a friend
but there's always a chance to make ammends
Forget today my tired soul
wipe the tears that fall from your eyes
Love has once again overlooked our door
but one day her sweet face will be seen again
Forget today my tired soul
don't dwell on the pain that lives within
the clouds are bleak and the sun seems so far away
but I promise you someday we'll have our moment to shine
