Today was the day everything went on its way
progress in love, work and Religion what a day
Is that out of your love God or a hole in my whole
life is unfaithful, ungrateful so I learned after all
Let me live that moment
smile and see the latent
when everything smiles to you
you are no longer one but two
so stop here tell me
why Have you chosen me?
Am I No longer Sara
known to be Hera
Amazing why You why you
when all I love, you did not do
you said an order from above
yeah when a caller called for love
will I leave my castle
descend on a fossil
so weird so clumsy
I in this world Have mercy!
for a man I loved not
yet for him I invest all my lot
struggle, fear, tear and despair
all are gone and will flare
For I will live to make him face
tribulations that stake, he will trace
all my torments and take them away
thus, we will begin our new furnished way
