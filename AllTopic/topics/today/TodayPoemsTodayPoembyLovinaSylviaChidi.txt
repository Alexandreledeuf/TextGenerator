Today
My alarm clock failed to ring
Today
Yoo-Hoo, The clock did not sing
Today
The trains made me get to work late
I was left staring at their shut gates
Today
I found myself exceedingly alone
Shivering in the flat cold to the bone
Today
My lover called and I got ditched
I really thought we’re going to get hitched
Today
I stank dreadfully; I did not have a shower
The sad news drained me of my will power
Today
I counted my pennies in twos and fours
My pockets were empty and poor
All the food I ate was bitter and sour
Today
All the programmes on TV were boring
Repetitious episodes had been reoccurring
I couldn’t go out as the rain was pouring
Today
In-between my thighs, I kept feeling horny
That tingly-tingly feel was not at all funny
Today
I read the newspaper without focus
Wondering what was the entire fuss
About sleeping with one’s boss
A whole page dedicated to it, was the loss
Today
I listened to some sad love songs
Speculating where I had done wrong
Next time, yes! I am going to be strong
Today
I fantasised about my next affair
Detailing it in my head with care
Another tragedy I simply cannot bear
Today
I sang, spoke and smiled
Whilst I had my nails filed
Today
I made positive future plans
I am my own number one fan
Of many visions, I am the woman!
Also by definition, I am the woman!
Today
I passed life’s challenge
Having my hearty revenge
I went off to bed felicitous
Every today is always joyous!
