A billion mouths has India to now feed,
And provide them with all that they may need;
To shelter, clothe them- what a great number!
And showing them the way to good slumber!
New millennium has brought on a new hype!
Ignorance makes them smoke tho’ not a pipe;
Day by day scarce resources become scant;
But none prefer to work hard like an ant.
The country’s heritage is in peril;
The rush for Big-Money is the devil;
Most people ignore life’s sense of values;
Our country can’t afford to repay dues.
Rededication is the one answer;
Keeping this goal, let Indians endeavor.
