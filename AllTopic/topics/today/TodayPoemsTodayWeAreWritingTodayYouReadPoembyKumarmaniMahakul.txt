We are writing today many verses
By command and grace of God,
By virtue and perseverance!
We are writing for God's service,
By his guidance in inner core,
For bringing transformation,
For cracking war and bringing peace,
We are writing today to transfer
The message of God in many poems,
You will read today and tomorrow!
Today we are writing, today you read,
Also tomorrow you read, read, and read,
For learning values and perspectives,
For developing inner beauty and personality,
When you uplift inner values and conscience
Automatically humanity shines with light,
You can decide what is right and wrong,
Expressing your selfless service towards all,
Carrying the values of divine empowerment,
Through love, peace and forgiveness you lead,
Godly knowledge helps you to recognize life.
Illusion cannot affect you if you are awakened,
Matters cannot bind you if you are detached,
Living life in attachment-free state you learn,
Every verse which carries God's message you read,
Name, fame, achievements, wealth and relationships,
All these things in material world are perishable,
At right time you acquire divine knowledge,
All those material things are related to body,
But you are soul different than body,
Finally when time of change comes,
You leave your body and form is changed,
Every material possession you leave behind
And it is destroyed in core of time!
Dear soul, you remain in awakened state.
