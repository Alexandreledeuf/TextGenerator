a tender breeze touches my skin
a horrible pain it's bringing
and I wanna go running
but I know Iâ€™ve got to let it in
it's so hard to face it all
cause I know tonight I'll fall
don't drag on me cause I can't keep strong
cause tomorrow I'll move on
but today, oh today
I've got to cry it all away
and tomorrow will bring back my sun
but today it all feels wrong
oooh today, yeah today,
I've got to cry it all away
and tomorrow with eyes dry
I'll be ready for another try
go walking in the wood
it's suppose to make me feel good
but today it hurts even more
than I'll go try out a shore
but the sand make my eyes tear
every time another spear
who makes the burden even harder
but I'll be fine one day farther
but today, oh today
I've got to cry it all away
and tomorrow will bring back my sun
but today it all feels wrong
oooh today, yeah today,
I've got to cry it all away
and tomorrow with eyes dry
I'll be ready for another try
it's just a blast
comes so fast
but I know
it will gow
over tomorrow
but today, oh today
I've got to cry it all away
and tomorrow will bring back my sun
but today it all feels wrong
oooh today, yeah today,
I've got to cry it all away
and tomorrow with eyes dry
I'll be ready for another try
