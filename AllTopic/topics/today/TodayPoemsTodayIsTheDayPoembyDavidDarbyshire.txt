So you think, today might be the day
It might be, it might be not?
Depends on your luck, if it goes your way
or you could get caught?
This might be the beginning, the first day
the first day of the rest of you life
you want to go down on one knee and pray
that all will be abundant and rife
this is the day, like everyday
seize it well, grab it tight
do your job, have fun, play
then you'll sleep well, very well tonight
