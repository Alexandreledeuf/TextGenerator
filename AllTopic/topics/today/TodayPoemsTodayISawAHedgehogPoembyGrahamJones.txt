Today I saw a Hedgehog
A funny looking thing
He crept across the lawn outside
As I sat watching him
He snuffled through the leaves and grass
His nose twitched like a snake
And then he stopped quite suddenly
As he came across a rake
At first he rolled into a ball
Quite comical to see
Then slowly poked his head out
And I'm sure he winked at me
Once more he turned towards the rake
Who's spines looked somewhat higher
And slowly moved toward it
With what to me, looked like desire
First he nudged it with his nose
Then rubbed against the prongs
Then getting no reaction
Seemed to sense that somethings wrong
And then he tried to mount it
But that just came to grief
And shuffled off indignantly
Which came as some relief
And so I've learned a moral
From this hedgehog in his teens
Things that we take for granted
Are not always as they seem.
