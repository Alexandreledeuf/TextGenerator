Our ride
Through life
Is short
At best
Choices made
Do count
Moments lived
Savored
Memories made
Golden
Embraced in
The gilded
Frames of time
Honored vestiges
Of Era's of
Yesterday
And today
That are too
Soon gone
Reflections play
Like the waters
Still but forever
Deep mirror's
Of the Soul
