Show me that you love me
But do not speak a word
Show me that you long for me
Without a sound being heard
Let your eyes seduce me
Entice me with your stare
Lovingly caress me
Let you hands show you care
Show me that you love me
Let your body language talk
Anyone can speak the words
But can you walk the walk?
Let your passion connect me
To the love your offering tonight
Share your true intentions
Baby, letâ€™s do this right
Show me that you love me
Wear your heart upon your sleeve
Silent without words
Can you make me believe?
