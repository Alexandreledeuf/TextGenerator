The sun will shine on you again,
Your spirit will be lifted from within,
Beyond dark clouds, thunder and rain,
You'll rise up with new strength
To bounce back again.
For you are a somebody
On God's treasured shelf.
Some roads may be rough,
Some hours may be lonely,
Some moments may be painful,
Some tears may be silent,
Some tasks may be heavy,
Some days may be long,
But don't go without a day.
To give your heart a happy song.
Go ahead...believe in yourself.
