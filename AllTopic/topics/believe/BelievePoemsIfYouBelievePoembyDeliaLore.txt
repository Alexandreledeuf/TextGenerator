If you believe you will receive, the greatest gift of all
you can conquer highest mountain tops,
they will look very small If You Believe . . .  The dark cloud hanging on the day,
will very quickly pass away If You Believe . . .  Problems surmount in all degrees,
but you can discharge it as you please If You Believe . . . Reality helps pave the way,
to lighten burdens sent each day If You Believe . . . The rising sun, the evening moon, denotes a message too,
that all above can be resolved, it just depends on you If You Believe . . .
