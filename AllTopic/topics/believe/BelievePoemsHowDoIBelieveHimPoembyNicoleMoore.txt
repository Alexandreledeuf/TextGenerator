He said he would love me
He said he would always be there for me
He said that he would stay with me forever
How do I believe him
He said that the distance doesn't matter
He said we would be together one day
He said he would never hurt me
How do I believe him
He said love is forever
He said things were really good
He said that I was his everything
How do I believe him
