I believe that you will guide me to finish my work
I believe that you will take me back to my home
I believe if I hurt you then you will forgive me
I believe you will sweet like my sugar candy

I believe that u will light my dark nights by ur moon
I believe u will relief my thirsty by ur rain
I believe u will send me ur sun when I need him
I believe u will always flow ur cool wind that I can take breath
I don’t know what to do with out you …. But
I believe u will always watching me from ur place
I believe u will lift up me when I will fall down
I believe  u will make me that strong that I can lift up other
I believe u help me to let know other that u are with me
