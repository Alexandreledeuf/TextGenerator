I believe in yesterdays with fine tunes
Where new spring came through in fineness's touch
Where love song were sung 'I love you so much'
And feelings meant all in its afternoons
Sweet summer come back with those pretty things
That filled my longings in its stillness time
With inspirational blossoms in their prime
And still to my heart for always here sings
Rain is now outside and dripping all wet
Filling my emotions with a sullen sky
That never seems ending - day after day
Where are the red flowers my heart once met?
Give me back the dreams of blue darling's sky
Those only are memories - still far away
