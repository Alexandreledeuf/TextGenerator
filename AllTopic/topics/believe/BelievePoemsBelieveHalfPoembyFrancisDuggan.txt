Believe half of what you read in magazines and newspapers for journalists and reporters tend to exaggerate
And don't believe one word that a politician utters for out of lies success they can create
And some people of course are so very gullible and they tend to believe all they hear and read
They do not seem to see through the power hungry who by their ambiguity mislead.
Believe all you read and hear in the media and you won't have opinions of your own
For to bend the truth one might say more than slightly the newsbreakers have become quite well known
The ruling Government give them false information and the truth a thing the legislators fear
And the lies they broadcast are followed by more lies and they only tell us what we wish to hear.
Believe half of what you read in the newspapers that's how it is and it's always been that way
And one lie always leads on to another that's what wise people have been known to say
And many people only want to hear what suits them of which the media magnates seem aware
And falsehoods can keep Governments in office and falsehoods can create a billionaire
