His spirit moves across the waters,
His word is knocking on my heart,
His joy rising like the waters,
His endless love is the best part.
I see the cross on Calvary hill,
I see redemption in its shine,
I see his suffering in the turmoil,
I see the truth that made him mine.
The beauty’s real and I can hold it,
The water stretches sky to meet,
The grace of God an endless washing,
The nails piercing hands and feet.
And there’s forgiveness in the beauty,
And as I sit here on this eve,
He is my God and I his daughter
He is my life and I believe.
