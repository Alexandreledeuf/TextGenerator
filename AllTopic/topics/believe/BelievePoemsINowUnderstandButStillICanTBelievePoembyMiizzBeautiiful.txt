I now understand but still I can't believe,
the things I hear or see
I jus don't know what to do,
the things I hear and see
my eyes still won't let my heart believe,
I've opened up but I now I think I should close her down,
she can't go threw anymore pain...
I now understand but still I can't believe,
that everything I've been threw
and u really don't care about me
I jus don't know why are u here if ur not here for me,
maybe its jus to toy with me heart and see how much it bleeds
I've been throw to much to jus let u run all over my heart like that....
I now understand but still can't believe,
why no how could u do this to me
I've given u my all and this is how u say thanks
by crushing my heart and soul,
by leaving them to bleed so that some other person can't save them...
I now understand but still can't believe,
that it was never only me....it was she..her but never we........
