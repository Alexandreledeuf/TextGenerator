What do you believe in, when you wake up to the dawn?
What do you believe in, when you hear a birds gift of song?
What do you hope for, when all hope is lost?
What do you believe in, and what now was the cost?
What do you dream of, when the world tells you, 'you've failed? '
What treasures do you search for, if only to fill some empty pails?
What will you leave for time, but mans garbage and endtrails?
What should one seek after, when all else is gone?
What did God show man in Proverbs,
and from the nails placed into His palms?
What was the meaning of the words, this Man of God did speak?
What were the Commandments for, if man refuses them to keep?
What will the end be, for it will come in the twinkling of an eye?
When will the world hear of God, in the 'Sweet by and by? '
