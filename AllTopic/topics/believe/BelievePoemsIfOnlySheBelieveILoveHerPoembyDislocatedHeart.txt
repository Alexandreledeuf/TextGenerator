music blasted in the air.
birds are flyin every where.
can you feel the love tonight
or is it just in my sight?
she loves me..
ohh.. yes she does..
can the moon not be brighter to match that smile on her face.
could the sun dim just a bit so i can look up and look back at her and say damn your hot.
she is my world.
nothing can compare to how im feeling.
this is just the way i wanna tell her.
i love her.
if only she knew.
i would write my heart out to her.
i would sing her a song.
i would tell her stories.
i would look her in the eyes and say,
babe i love you.
if only she believe the words coming out of my mouth.
she would know,
im lost in her eyes,
i wont find my way out.
im lost in her world,
i gotta stay somehow.
i love her.
if only she knew.
if only she believed.
i love her.
