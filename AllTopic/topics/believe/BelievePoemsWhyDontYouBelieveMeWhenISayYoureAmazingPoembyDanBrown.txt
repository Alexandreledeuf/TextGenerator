Why don’t you believe me when I say you’re amazing?
When I say you have the most handsome face?
Why don’t believe me when I tell you I dream of it?
When I say its your lines, with my finger, I trace?
Why don’t you believe me when I say you’re amazing?
When I say your smile lights up my day?
Why don’t you believe me when I tell you its sexy?
When I tell you how you smile my troubles away?
Why don’t you believe me when I say you’re amazing?
When I say you have the goldenest hair?
Why don’t you believe me when I tell you it warms me?
When I say how I sit and stare?
Why don’t you believe me when I say you’re amazing?
When I say you have the softest skin?
Why don’t you believe me when I try to describe it?
When I don’t even know where to begin?
Why don’t you believe me when I say you’re amazing?
When I genuinely tell you I love you?
Why don’t you believe me when I tell you I need you?
When I say this is all so new?
Why don’t you believe me when I say you’re amazing?
Why do you suggest I lie?
I hope you’ll soon believe me when I say you’re amazing,
because I’ll say it till the day I die.
