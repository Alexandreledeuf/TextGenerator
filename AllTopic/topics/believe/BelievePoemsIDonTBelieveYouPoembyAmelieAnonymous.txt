I don’t believe you
When you say you care
I don’t believe you
When you say you’ll be there
I don’t believe you
When you say I should live
Why would you want me
When I have nothing to give
I just can’t believe
You want me in your life
Some messed up little girl
Who cuts herself with a knife
I don’t believe you
When you say you care
I don’t believe you
Or that you’ll be there.
