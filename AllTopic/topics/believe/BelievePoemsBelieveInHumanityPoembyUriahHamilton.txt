You can dance
Like a drunk
In the summer night,
Laugh with strangers
In the moonlight,
Gaze at girls
That walk in the red light,
Say prayers at hillside shrines
To Shinto Deities
That your parents
Never knew.
Everything is a combination
Of misery and poetry.
You have to swim
In a lake of suffering
To reach the shore
Of self-knowledge
About the reason
You’re living for.
I’m living to sing
A tender song at dawn
That will break God’s heart:
I want to make him
Linger here in tears
Until he helps us along
This sad journey
That we’re traveling upon.
I believe in Divinity
And I need for Divinity
To believe in humanity.
