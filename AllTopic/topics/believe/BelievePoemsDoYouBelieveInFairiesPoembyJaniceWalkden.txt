Do you believe in fairies?
Could fairies really exist?
Do they live in flowers & gardens?
Do they play in the morning mists?
Do they tend to nature
With loving healing care
Do they fly through the forests
Would we see them there?
Are they oh so gentle?
Are they Heaven sent?
Do they fly  with the butterflies
until the day is spent?
Oh I would love to see them
To catch sight of them at play
Dancing around the flowers
just going about their day
