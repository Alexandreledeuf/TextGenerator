I stand just inches away from you but
i feel like i am half way around the world from you
and i can't get any closer to you
@ that moment i run my hand through your hair
In life i've battled through obstacles and huurls
but i dont care i will tell you til my face is blue
i'll fight anything for you, i'm sorry i thought you knew
even if the pain is too much to bare
i've been with a lot of gurls
but none of them compare to you
if you ever doubt how much i love you
let me tell you this i wont promise i will love you for the rest of your life
but i can love you for the rest of mine & i can promise i will try to make you happy to the best of my abilities
Angellica, i love you more than life itself. believe me i'll love you until time stands still. just believe it.
