I've fallen in love very deeply with someone
i guess it just didn't show
'cause he told me he doesn't believe my love
but believe me, it's hard to let go...
I've prayed for him each night before sleeping
but i've never let him know
i'm trying very hard to get over him
but believe me, it's hard to let go...
I've shared my joys, i've shared my sorrows
and best friends we have been though
with each passing day my pain has increased
but believe me, it's hard to let go...
I've even thought of saying goodbye
though out of it he made me grow
and with time going by, i'm dependant i feel
but believe me, it's hard to let go...
I've now got control of my life
still the tears in my eyes continue to flow
i don't know how to live my life wiothout him
but believe me, it's hard to let go...
