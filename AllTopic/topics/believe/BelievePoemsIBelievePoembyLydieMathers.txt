I believe that there are times when no one person is wrong or right.
I believe that there are things in this world that are less important then holding your children tight.
I believe in love that is true.
I believe that all love has it's struggles but we make it through.
I believe that my children and yours are here to do wonderous things.
I believe that we should not hinder them but give them hope and wings.
I believe that God will see me through any storm.
I believe that every disfunctional family is the Norm.
I believe that death will greet us all one day.
I believe that I will not be scared and LIVE along the way.
I believe that life can pass us by unexpectedly.
I believe that some people will let it pass unemotionally.
I believe that there is always a way to get through.
But most of all I believe in Me as well as You.
