Only believe
That Jesus can save.
Only believe
The Promise he gave.
A home in heaven
Is waiting for you.
A home in heaven,
Believe, it is true.
Jesus has died
To save you from sin.
Jesus has died
That you may come in.
Believing in Christ
You'll help spread the news.
Believing in Christ
You'll change peoples views.
Believing you'll work
To save some each day.
Believing you'll work,
And meet Him one day.
Give thanks to Him
For all that He's done.
Give thanks To Him
In prayer everyone.
