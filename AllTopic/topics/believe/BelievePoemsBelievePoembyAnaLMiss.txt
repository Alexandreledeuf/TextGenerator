Just as the river
flows to the sea
All things will come easy
if they are meant to be
All you have to do is just believe
it does not matter what anyone say
No one's going to rain
on your parade
Some may believe that life has to be hard
but, their belief you can disregard
you don't have to swim up stream
that is how you kill a dream
All you have to do is let it flow
Just believe and let it go
Your dreams child will grow
Just believe in what you know
