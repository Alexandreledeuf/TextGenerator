Heart, believe me.
That was just a night...
How fool it is for my mind
to linger his words this way;
to trace every curve of his lips
and to flip a shadow of his pretty hair.
Oh, how fool it is for my mind
to think of him this way.
Heart, believe me.
That was just a night;
and I became a fool forever.
