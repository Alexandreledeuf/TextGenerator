I believe in having good friends
They keep you up to date
With the latest fashion trends
I believe in telling jokes
I want to laugh regularly
Until I choke
I believe in being serious
There is always an air
Of you being mysterious
Even if there is nothing there
I believe in good sex
It is a good form of exercise
Even though it can be complex
I believe in love
Be it from down below
Or heaven-sent from above
I believe in fate
It is not something you create
It just happens out of the sudden
I believe in luck
But only when it works
When it doesn’t I just mock
I believe in hard work
Not only talk, talk, talk
It is work that earns you the buck
I believe in you
But sometimes do wonder
If all the things you say are true
I believe in good food
Spiced with romance after
To lighten up the mood
I believe in making babies
Then turning them
To gentlemen and ladies
I believe in courage
Strength with sense and not rage
I believe in dreams
But not the ones that make you scream
I believe in God
No ones knowledge and power
Is that vastly broad
And last of all
I believe in me
If I stopped believing
Then life’s wonderful gifts
Would not be worth receiving
