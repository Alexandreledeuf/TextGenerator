BTW-My sister (Eryka)    and I wrote this. I got some ideas from Cassie and her really weird poem. So here it is! ! !
Do you believe in God?
Let the heavens above
Blend the spirits together
Once fallen, no one saved
Do you believe in God?
Let the heavens above
Give us the feeling to live
Once fallen, no one saved
Fire, blood, & water rain on you
Fire, blood, & water rain on you
Don't forget give half the credit to my sister Eyrka. Thanks! ! ! !
