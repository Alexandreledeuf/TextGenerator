I believe in rainbows and golden sunbeams
i believe in hopes and dreams
i believe in that old fable always told of old
That at the rainbows end there's a pot of gold
i believe there's some place beyond the blue
Where the promise of Love and Peace is forever true
i believe in me and you
i believe in miracles, for i have known a few
i believe in me and you
i believe in miracles, for i have known a few
i believe in me and you
