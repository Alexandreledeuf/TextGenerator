Do not kill dreams you believe in,
Embrace it
Even if some just have gone
Let moments of joy to fill you all
And relish it
Caress your mind by beauty and smile
And live by this every day
Do not murder hope
For something special which will come
Soon
Just believe and smile
And wait a while
And you will have it
