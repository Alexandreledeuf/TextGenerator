I believe in miracles.
and dreams that will come true.
I believe in tender moments.
I believe in reaching out,
and touching from the heart.
I believe that if we touch,
a gift we can pass on.
I believe that if you cry
your tears are not in vain.
when you're sad and lonely,
others know your pain.
I believe that when we laugh
a sparkle starts to shine,
and I just know that spark will spread
from more hearts than just mine.
I believe the gifts you have,
are there for you to share.
and when you give from the heart,
the whole world knows you care.
I believe that comfort comes
from giving part of me.
and if I share with others,
there's more for all to see.
I believe that love is still
the greatest gift of all.
and when it's given from the heart,
then not one of us will fall.
