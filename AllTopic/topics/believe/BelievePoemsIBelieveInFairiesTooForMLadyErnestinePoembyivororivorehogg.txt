Sometimes at night across the sky.
I see the silver dragons fly.
Although not everyone can see
the dragons dancing gracefully.
My friends think I have lost the plot
but I assure them I have not.
I don’t know why they cannot see
what is so very clear to me.
Perhaps I have an open mind
and they do not, so they are blind.
Moonlight reflecting on their scales.
This is a sight that never fails
to make me stop and realise.
Some cannot see though they have eyes.
They don’t believe the evidence
of their own eyes. It makes no sense.
Because they can’t believe it’s true
and won’t adjust their point of view.
But I believe and I can see
the dragons flying easily.
When twilight falls if you just try,
you too will see them fly
Unless you too, have closed your
mind and don’t believe in dragon kind.
