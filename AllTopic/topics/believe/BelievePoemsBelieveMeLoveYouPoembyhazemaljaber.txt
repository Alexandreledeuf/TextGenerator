do you believe that,
you became every thing in my life..
do you believe that,
i care about you and missed you every moment..
do you believe that,
i need and want to be near to you every night..
do you believe that,
i love every one who is like you in face and a voice and a smile...
do you believe that,
i suffer so much in your leaving and never to take a breathe well...
do you believe that,
i afraid from my eyes to show up me that i love you...
do you believe that,
i become jealous from any air goes around your neck...
do you believe that,
i loved you and never loved one as you..
believe me that,
i love you...
