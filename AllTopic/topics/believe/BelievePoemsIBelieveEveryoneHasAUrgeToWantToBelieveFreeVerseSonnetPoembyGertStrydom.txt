I believe everyone has an urge to want to believe,
even if they are agnostic or sceptical about God
and in each human being He does create that ability,
where we want to go to someone with our own destiny,
even if a person do only come to a sense of belonging,
where organized systems do make people anxious,
it's to an Upper-Being that everyone does long,
somebody to talk to, who could give protection,
where there is a yearning for someone who do understand,
where we want to come to God without any fear,
to someone that stands between man and dilapidation,
where people want to be free from myths and icons:
do want to know a God, who is sincere with us,
in a world full of pain and darkness.
