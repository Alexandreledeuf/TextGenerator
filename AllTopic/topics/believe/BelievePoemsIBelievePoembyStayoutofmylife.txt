Lord give me faith and hope cuz Im in need
and my bodies waiting oh so patiently
cuz I believe in you indeed
Is there someone imitating me
bring her back because I'm jealous please
cuz I believe in you indeed
searching deep down trying to find and see
see the life that's right in front of me
cuz I believe in you indeed
find that person that I want to be
find her deep down way inside of me
cuz I believe in you indeed
doesn't take a miracle you'll see
there's that sweet person inside of me just waiting
cuz I believe in you indeed
who's the person that I claim to be
a mere glimpse of the past of me
cuz I believe in you indeed
