I Can't Believe
'I can't believe'
I can't believe, I can't believe
this is so not happen to me
everything in my world is dark
and never gray
i could ask for help
but we all know
help never finds its way
only power and money
can do as they please
so i ask why is this
so happen to me
will the greedy
and the bad
some day go to hell
or will the evil ones
find a way to pay
their way out of
going to sinners jail
I can't believe~
