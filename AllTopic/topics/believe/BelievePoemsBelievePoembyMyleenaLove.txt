I wake in the night and let out a sigh,
And whisper your name and wonder why;
I'm not in your arms, while your holding me tight,
I should be there with you tonight.
Look into your heart and tell me what you see,
When you think of me, is there possibility?
Take me in your arms, and please don't leave;
I'll hold on to you tight, and hope that you believe.
Believe in love, always and forever.
Believe in us, you and I together.
I'm not like other girls, I won't just leave.
When you look into my eyes...Do you believe?
Believe me when I say, for your love, I'll wait forever.
With all my heart, I believe that we belong together.
Believe me when I say, I've given you my heart,
You should've known that from the very start.
Tell me, you believe that my hearts true,
Tell me, you believe that I love you.
Now, answer me one question, before I leave....
Tell me, do you believe?
