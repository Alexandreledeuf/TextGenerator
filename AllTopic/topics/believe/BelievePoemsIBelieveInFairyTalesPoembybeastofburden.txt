Riding on the backs of giant snails
Ships with cotton candy sails
Iridescent castles, bubble blown
Mountains made of chocolate scones
Pigs that fly upside down in the sky
The moon at night made of cream pie
Riding through the sky on dragon tails
Sunbathing on the backs of whales
I believe in all these things
Even the lullabies a unicorn sings
