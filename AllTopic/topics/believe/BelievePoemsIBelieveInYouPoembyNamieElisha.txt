I believe in your rising and falling
I believe in your smiles and tears
i believe  in your joys and pains
i believe in your seed  and name
i believe in your sunrise and sunset
i believe in your clouds and raindrops
i believe in your moon and galaxy of stars
i believe  in you struggles and hopes
i believe in your desires and angels
i believe in your soil
i believe  in your future
i believe in your generation
'cos i believe in you
