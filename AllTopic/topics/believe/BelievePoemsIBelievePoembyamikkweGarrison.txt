I believe
in one who sets me free
I believe
in one who heals me
I believe
in one who comforts me
I believe
in one who gives me joy
I believe
in one who softens my heart
I believe
in one who gives me everything
I believe
in one who leads me
I believe
in one who speaks to me
I believe
in one who gives me life
I believe
in one who shows me mercy
I believe
in one who prays for me
I believe
in one who is wonderful
I believe
in one who died for me
Now who do you believe in?
