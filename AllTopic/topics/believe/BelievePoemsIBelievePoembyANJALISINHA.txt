When I wake up every morn,
Its with the awe of jus being alive
and being with you,
To reach out for that specialness,
Which the almighty has bestowed upon me,
And rouse those around me
to the potential of each new morn.
I am not afraid to admit,
That often, I am less than perfect.
Life is nothing but trial and error,
I believe in my heart
And my powers,
That something great is about to happen.
This keeps the sun - all time shining,
and the Rainbows that  we built together.
With every breath that I take,
Mystery lies deep within.
Your voice resonating,
Like seagulls on the shore.
Your wavy essence washes over me,
Flooding me with emotions.
Tosses me into that special place-
I long to be.
You are the diamonds of my night sky,
You are the sparkling  crystals of grainy  dust,
in the desert of my solitude.
Your serene face draws me to tranquility,
Thatâ€™s where I long to belong for eternity.
Yes I believe in miracles,
All my avenues and possibilities are open.,
And look with hope to the horizon of  today,
For Today is truly all that I really have.
For the morrow I cannot say.
