“I could write the saddest poems tonight”
A stolen verse from the saddest poem I ever read
And think once he was mine
And now that is in the past
That He left my soul destroyed
Now I don’t believe in love
Once I was in love, and it was nice
A consolation prize the memories
Of the sweetest kiss I had received
The day he stole one from me
Only God knows if he loves me once?
I simply have the anguish to figure out
Whether once he loves me or not
The sun sees me and hides from me
I only get thistle from the field
The same field that gave me roses
When I proposed to him
Countless stars on that ebony sky
The only thing that now I have
Meanwhile I’m lost in this fogy land
I’m starting to believe:
That no one ever will love to me
