Oh, let me not believe in any man,
For men are undependable creatures;
'Tis God who gives each man life's unique span;
So, let me not believe in false preachers.
Oh, let me put my trust in God all life;
His love for man has no limits, I know;
And let my love for God increase in strife;
To my Redeemer, huge a debt, I owe.
Oh, let me not believe in earth's Masters;
They are as sinful as everyone else;
Let me avoid the gullible Pastors;
They are like poison- flowers with sweet smells!
Let me have faith in God alone always;
Let me in prayers pass my earthly days.
