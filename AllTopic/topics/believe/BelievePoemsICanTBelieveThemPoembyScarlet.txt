did they really think they could just take it all away
with just one word
did they think I would not fight
do they really think I gave a shit what they thought?
can they really be that stupid
do they really want me to be unhappy for the rest of my life?
cause that is what would happen if I listen to them
I can't believe it
I’ve suffered for 4 years
I now found happiness
do they think I wouldn't fight to keep it
how could they think that?
are they really that blind
do they not see I’m happier than I’ve ever been
truth is I’ve never been happy
until now
and I don't want to lose it
especial because they don't like the way I found it
can't they just be happy?
can't they just let me be happy?
apparently not
some family
they don't want me happy
they fucking want me trapped
trapped in the darkness
trapped with them
trapped is a state of numbness
