i believe in love letters and red roses
but i dont believe in us touching noses
i believe in those cheesy lines from those hollywood flicks
but i dont believe in us stealing kisses on the cheeks
i believe in things such as rules of engagement
but i dont believe in us building firm attachment
i believe in the pair of Mickey and Minnie mouse
but i dont belive in you being my spouse
i believe in sweethearts running on the shore
but i dont believe in us cuddling on the floor
i believe in blind dates and chemistry
but i dont believe in going out with you on the 14th of february
i believe in teddy bears and lipstick stains on the collar
but i dont believe in our relationship would go as far
i believe in carving names on the backyard tree
but i dont believe in the future of you and me
coz we once allowed ourselves to hold on and try
but you lose your grip easily and always turn out to goodbye
all those candy-coated things that love has
perhaps will never be applicable to us
i do have faith on paraphernalias of affection
just like i do have faith on divine intervention
i believe in forever and heartaches too
coz i believe in love but i dont believe in loving you
