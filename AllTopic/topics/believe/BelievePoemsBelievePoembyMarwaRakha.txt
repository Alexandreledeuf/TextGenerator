With the power of my thoughts I summoned you;
With a blink I made you vanish.
On a dark trip your spirit shall wander
and as it gets darker you shall believe in me.
Ungrateful creature, I am your heaven and haven;
Ingratitude is a sin, and sinners live an eternity in hell.
In mazes of confusion your spirit shall wander;
In utter darkness demons of the past shall haunt you;
Of happiness you are incapable
then you shall dwell in misery and isolation.
Have I not tried to befriend you?
Have I not held you and healed you?
But alas, you are just another ungrateful creature;
Reside in darkness and dwell in fear.. I thee curse.
Know me or know me not... I am a collector;
for when you were not looking,
in your core, I planted my seed.
Before you know it,
I shall grow in your soul
like a leafy tree of a hundred years.
