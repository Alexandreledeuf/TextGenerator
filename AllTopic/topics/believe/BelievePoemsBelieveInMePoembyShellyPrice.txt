What have I done this time,
to deserve your wrath?
What infraction have I violated,
causing this kink in our path?
Where did I go wrong,
I really have to know.
Please tell me what I did,
don't just get up and go.
Don't shut me out again,
don't close every door.
Don't use silence as a weapon,
to justify settling a score.
Please talk to me, I'll listen,
to every word you have to say.
I'm your lover and your friend,
so please don't treat me this way.
Please tell me with words,
what has made you retreat,
into the darkness of solitude,
feeling defeated and beat.
It can't be what you think,
that would mean I had purpose.
Dig deeper for your answers,
don't just scratch on the surface.
Give me the benefit of your doubt,
and choose to trust and believe.
It takes far less energy to love,
than it does to practice to deceive.
