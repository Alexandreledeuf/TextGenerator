Life is full of make believe,
dreams of earnest topping fame.
Gilded Lilies spring up everywhere
as if in some dark nightmare.
We look with weary eyes
at temples we want to climb.
The shrines we want to spell out our name,
but with heavy sighs, we heave,
knowing our dreams are but make believe.
Each hill we climb
brings us closer,
to our vacant dreams departed.
Still we strive towards them,
hoping one day to catch a glimpse,
of what our heart wants most,
the dreams that will not fade,
in the hollow halls,
of the land of make believe.
