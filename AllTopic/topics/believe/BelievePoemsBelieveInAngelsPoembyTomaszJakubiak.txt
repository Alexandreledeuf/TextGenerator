Believe in Angels
even if their wings are black
believe in the Devil
even if over his horns
you see a burning halo
Believe in Love thatâ€™s blind
and equally blind Hatred
Believe in words sneered by time
believe in Fear
Believe with your eyes and longing palms
pictures filled with colours and magical
Silence
Believe in touch, in music and in voice,
And in Quietness
Believe in thousands of everyday matters
One day just believe
In me
