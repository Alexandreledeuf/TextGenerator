I never believed in magic...
until u came into my life;
then all have been magical in my eyes.
I never believed that dreams come true;
till u made them real for me..
then all I see with you is just reality.
I never believed that love could move mountains...
till u moved one for me;
and then i knew that love could set me free.
And i never believed that one could die of a broken heart.
I believe it now- when you left me...
when you left me helplessly.
