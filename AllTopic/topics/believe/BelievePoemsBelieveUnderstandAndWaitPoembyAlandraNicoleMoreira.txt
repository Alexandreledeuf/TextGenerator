Believe in the purpose
Understand it's meaning
And wait for the results
Believe in yourself
Understand that you can't be perfect
And wait for your reaction
Believe in the truth
Understand the lie
And wait to fit them together
Believe in what you see
Understand what you hear
And wait to judge
It's the process of thinking
Believe and understand
Speak and wait for results
