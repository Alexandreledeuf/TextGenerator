I wonder what she thinks right now,
As she sits in the shadows alone,
She has touched a deeper part of me,
A part that is yet unshown.
I wonder if she even knows,
The truth hidden deep inside,
Does she think me the lamb for slaughter,
Or some wolf of howling pride.
Does she care, the feeling, locked so deep
Does she care, her touch, has stopped the weep,
Does she know, her whisper, sparks the flame,
Life moves on, wonder not, I have no name.
Are there truly Angels that live among us,
And if they stood beside us, would we know,
Is there a safe harbour to lay our trust,
A fertile ground to make love grow.
Yet she be an angel if I have ever met,
Though in physical form she be not,
Her gentle caress, my safest bet,
With sweetest touch, my heart she has bought.
