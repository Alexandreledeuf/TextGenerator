I can see all things now.
I can see so many tears.
I can see so much pain, In so many faces.
I can see it all so clearly now.
I can sense the pain,
In the souls passing by.
I can feel hearts breaking,
I can feel so much sorrow, that shouldn't be.
Please don't weep, not for me.
I am so much better off now.
Can you believe, I am actually happy.
I can see everything so clearly now.
Look up, see the leaves as they move,
See the clouds as they float by.
Feel the wind on your face,
Taste the rain on your tongue.
It is me.
I still exist.
I will always be with you.
I still exist.
