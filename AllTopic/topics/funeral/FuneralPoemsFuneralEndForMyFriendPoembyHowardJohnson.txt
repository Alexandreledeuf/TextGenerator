I am standing at your funeral
Ready to say good bye
I am standing here
Ready to cry
Memories for me to recall
Of my first ball
Climbing tall  trees
Skined up knees
Swinging High
Touching the sky
When I returned
Your arms were there
Wraping me
With warmth comfort and care.
I am wondering why
This could'nt last?
Ending Days
Of my childhood past
Grave site train
Tears turn to  torrid rain
Good bye mother
There never will be another
Sadness is my care
My heart has a tear..
Outside waiting funeral hearse,
Taking from me, without coerce,
Your touch is far away
Angels guiding your way.
