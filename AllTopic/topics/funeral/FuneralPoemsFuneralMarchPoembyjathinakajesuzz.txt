march my soldiers march!
today is that day
feel like its you who died
for the best of us has left
march my soldiers march!
today is that day
when we pay for our silence
when we fail ourselves
march my soldiers march!
they strike us like dumb dogs
we are sitting ducks with a dead conscience
march my soldiers march!
we fall around like flies around fire
as we seek refuge in dark like alley rats
march my soldiers march!
with a single button finger they break our worlds
with a jihadi heart they spit blasphemous words
march my soldiers march!
see our brother's blood
is it redder than ours?
march my soldiers march!
don't you dare be sad
don't you dare cry
don't you dare forget
march my soldiers march!
today is that day
today our brother's soul rests in peace
today is the day we avenge our brothers
today is the day we make peace
today is the day we go to war
