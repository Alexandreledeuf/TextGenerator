Darkness encompasses my space
My future seen bleak, feral beasts hide
Not even a glow worm to throw light
I see no chance of deliverance.
Through the mazy depths of gloom, I wade
Struck with the pestilence of rejection and hate
Hopes are now like shredded threads
Frayed away from a rope
I seek shade under a leafless tree
I hold on to a crutch as a prop
I curl up like a helpless embryo
Floating and swivelling in lucid agony
Shutters of distress is about to close in
Before that, I will my own death
In the absence of pall bearers
I shall carry my orphaned corpse
And walk the deserted road
Inching my way to the grave
