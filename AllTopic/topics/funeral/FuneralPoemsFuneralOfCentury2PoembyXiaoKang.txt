Funeral Of Century（2）
LOL. I hope my english will be better than in (1) .
East coast, Tsunami rushed like wolves
Cloudburst was the flag, then
here the ceremony of funeral started
Holy water to wash all sin was the flood
To clean the evil in past
and share the guitly in future
Righteous were willing to die for salvation
but the Lord lost his patience
Curse falled down with rain to the world
Ancient Civilization, To be buryed or submerged
To be baptized the world
Cry and cry, scream again scream
No Noah's Ark to be found
East coast, people still intoxicated
Resentment, To feed the demon stronger
The ghostes drunk like a fish
with the heavy punch smashed they run away
Puppets still not noticed the dangerous
Condor wheeled in the air above the upcoming food
Shrug, dreariness as well as dismal
The magic song flew from faraway -
for last time of the earth
for last time of the day
Ancient Civilization, To be buryed or submerged
To be baptized the world
Cry and cry, scream again scream
No Noah's Ark to be found
