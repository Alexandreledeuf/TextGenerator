26/10/10 a poets funeral
On a very humid Tuesday morning
A cavalcade of cars slowly move by
Rose petals on the hot black tarmac
Like words from his directory of verse
Or tear drops for the one now beyond his time
Then the poet himself comes grinning wide
Enjoying the ambulance wind shield ride
Even as most of him lay inside properly iced
The poet whom the state briefly forgot
In his dying days – a tramp in hospital corridors
Now inching towards his hour of crowning glory
To fresh garlands and stately wreaths
Before the switch is finally flipped
And he is consecrated to the elements five
A state funeral for a derelict poet
A poet who now will continue to live on ……………………..
