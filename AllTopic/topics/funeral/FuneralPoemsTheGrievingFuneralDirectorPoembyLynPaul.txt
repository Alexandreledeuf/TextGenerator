She collected the deceased from the mortuary
She washed the body down seeing the body peacefully free
Then she dressed the body in what 'The family' had chose
Now dressed so bright, holding a RED rose
She then collected an upstanding coffin that was lined along the wall...
Carefully placing it on a pedestal
So ready to drill the handles and line the coffin with lace
Then engraving the name plate at a steady pace
She then went back to the body and with family instructions
She added powder, blush then a little lipstick on
Then with 6 steady hands, placed her in
Into her pure white coffin where there would be only sleep ins
The 6 steady hands placed the body for the family to see
They all cried and cried... just could not believe
Could not believe she was gone and here no more
They knew they had to accept even though they were raw
The grieving Funeral Director had arranged the funeral as she knew how to do
She had placed the Funeral Notices and Ordered the flowers too
At the Cemetery Gate she walked and smiled in front of the Hearse
In Gods garden she was practising her verse
Her verse of hope and support that she would read to the family today
A verse to help them accept, there is no other way
So the reading went well..., the music had played
Family so happy they said: 'I wish not  to see you again... I'm afraid! '

This Grieving Funeral Director took a little sadness with her from each Funeral. Yet the pure satisfaction she received from helping these Grieving families was so well worth it.
