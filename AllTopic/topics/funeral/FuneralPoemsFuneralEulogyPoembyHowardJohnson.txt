A day to say I am sorry
A day to say I love you
A day filled with unending feelings
A day filled with chocked emotions
Yielding myself to showers of tears
The shortness of life yields to death
Not allowing us to gauge every friendship
Not allowing us to give thanks for the memories
Giving us to retain
The Mythical
The magical
Thought of all this
But can I feel solemnity
A voice screams
Tribute Tribute
Inside of me
The screaming battles
With the burning devils from hell
Cannot be heard
Pacify me and cool my thoughts
With your comfort
The place where you will go
Absence of conflict and strife
The sun will shine again
Leaving behind the black and white
Vivid colors of an intangible arch
Stemming from the last down pour of tears
A distant rainbow belonging to you
Begging me to run through
Fickle threads catching
Raining colors of your love
From your absence
Voids, hollowness, and distressed wounds
Are being stitched shut
Smoothing healing balm
Covers like a blanket
Keeping you alive within me forever.
