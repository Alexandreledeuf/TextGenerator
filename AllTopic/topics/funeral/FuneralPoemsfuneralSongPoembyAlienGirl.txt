You told me the song to play at your funeral
As if I can think that far ahead
I haven't even held your hand
or kissed your face
ran my fingers through your hair
or trailed them down your chest
i've never looked in your eyes
and told you that i love you
your touch I've never felt
nor the warmth of your body on mine
But you told me the song to play at your funeral
A grand assumption don't you think
