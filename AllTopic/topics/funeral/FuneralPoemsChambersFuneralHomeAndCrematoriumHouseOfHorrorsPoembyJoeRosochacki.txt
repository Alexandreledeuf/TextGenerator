Forty body bags thrown atop with each other
Labeled for cremation
Among them were women, men, children, fathers, mothers, sister and brothers
To be burnt to ash, that was their destination,
All rested inside a garage
Bodies decomposing
Their bodies leaked fluids through the bag
I guess they were not Zip-Lock bags
The funeral home had a contract with Georgetown Medical School,
William Chambers said that things were in disarray
What a frickin' fool!
His brother Tom denied any culpability
For this unsanitary, immoral, and most likely illegal fray.
Some of the bag tags were unidentifiable
Due to the immense leakage from the inside
The smell must've been grotesquely foul
Yet the Chambers Brothers did something wrong, you ask?
They flatly denied.
The mortuary license the Chambers had had been suspended last Friday
They have to cremate the bodies that they have in their possession
A&E should do a 'Hoarding' special series on Chambers Brothers.
So much for this observation.
