I thought if I took the flowers home
Flowers from a funeral
For a friend
A friend whose face
Looked unfamiliar
Unaware I was even there
Unsure if she'd really care
For cotton candy carnations
Lavender last goodbyes
A burly man carried
The carefully concocted
Cascades of colorful blooms
Close to the dumpster
The day after
He, disconnected from the despair
That dangled about my thoughts
But thought well enough
To stop long enough
To catch my stare
And spare the sprigs and sprays
Of fresh freesia
From the squashing stench
Of the sanitation truck's crunching
And handed them over to me
Like presenting a beauty queen
Her lavish winning bouquet
At home, with the  hum
Of a well working furnace
I put forth gallant  effort
Picking  purple plumes
From the florist's
Generic green foam
That held her final farewell
Gathered, I did in diligent work
Each vase from a collection of years
And brought to tears
Thinking if I watered them well
Placed beneath the light
Of my favorite window sill
Their fragrance to fill
My sadly lit room
Maybe, just maybe she'd stay
Awhile, share one more smile
Before being ready to say goodbye
Even the most beautiful bouquets
Wither wilt and die
