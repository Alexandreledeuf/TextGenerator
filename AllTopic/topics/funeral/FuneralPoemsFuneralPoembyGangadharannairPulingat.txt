The death, end of the life journey
But not the end itself
The joining of self to the universe
The place of oblivion we can't explain.
The body after death, a corpse
To be cremated in such an honor
The self, soul and their activities
For which the body functioned hitherto.
A funeral pyre we makes
For its destruction on bodily matters
The final destiny it follows
Where it becomes flames and ashes.
Funeral in varied customs and beliefs
Changes of methods and things are one
The final journey must be in calm
without a return and repetition of the same.
Honor the death, the will of god
Your actions and life events are reckoned
And matters to the humans
Let the final journey come when it destines.
In a calm and perfect time like a ripe leaf.
