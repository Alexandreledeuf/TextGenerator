I am water
Sometimes solid...you can always depend on
Sometimes liquid...fits in anywhere
Sometimes vapor...ephemeral...I am there and then I am gone
Sometimes ice...but can be dissolved by fire
Sometimes swirling....with passion
Sometimes tranquil....with still desire
Always flowing....unaware of the destination
Sometimes vivid....like blue sapphire
Always pure....see your reflection
Always rising...wanting to go higher
