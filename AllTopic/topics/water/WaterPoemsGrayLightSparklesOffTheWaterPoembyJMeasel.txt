Gray light sparkles off the water,
It lands in my eye as I look across the Lake.
The gray lake light turns upsidedown
As I look up into the Night's sky.
As I did so the upsidedown gray lake light raised above my head and became the Moon,
Shinning in all her glory.
Shinning reflections glanced off my eye
As I searched for stars in the Night's sky.
Finding little stars, with little planets, with little moons, and other night skys.
As I pondered how many moons, earths, and suns there are,
I moved forward, not walking,
But floating
Floating in the water of the Night's sky,
My eyes dared forcing me to ask, 'Where am I? '
In the Lake? no.-
In the Ocean? no.-
I open my eyes to see the Truth.
And looking right AT me...
The Moon,
The Stars,
The Suns,
The Night's sky of every World.
It was so much
Too much.
I wanted to look away, it was so much.
But I couldn't.  I kept looking, staring,
At the Moon, shinning brightly.
Breathing heavily, I zapped myself back to reality.
I opened my eye
And what did I find?
The moon in all her glory.
