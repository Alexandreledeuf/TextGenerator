Water water every where but not a dropp to spare,
It’s time to stop and really think
A war we must declare.
The stone dry enemy will dry all the river beds,
So we’ll fight this war together
With loaded Aussie water tanks..
If man can pump his oil a thousand ‘K’s
Across the dessert lands, let’s get pumping
Northern monsoon lakes to dryer southern lands.
And in this raining fight of ours
We must never never cower,
And hope all the couples in our hot sunburnt land
Will always pull together and share
Their morning shower.
