In a great deal of discomfort and pain.
having to stand after boarding the train.
I tried to be as pleasant looking as could be.
Didn’t want anyone to realize,
there was something wrong with me.
Ointments, salve, herb remedies and more.
Nothing seemed to work, from the health store.
I just couldn’t take it any longer,
had to find something stronger.
Mixed a few items and made a potion.
Wished I had just gone down to the ocean.
An appointment was made with a Chinese Doctor,
a referral from a very good friend.
His facial expression showed concern,
He closed his eyes and raised his head.
To my surprise, he smiled and said,
This area is angry and burning red.
What I have to say to you is simple
and proved to be true.
Bathe the area with running water,
Come back and see me in seven days.
With this treatment, you will be amazed.
I did just as the Doctor ordered, of course.
His prescription was made very clear.
I continued to bathe the area with water.
No pills, no powders, no cream or oils.
Amazingly, the pain and stinging was gone.
No sign the angry problem ever existed.
This Doctor taught me a great lesson.
Look at what nature has in store,
Find yourself God’s natural cure.
