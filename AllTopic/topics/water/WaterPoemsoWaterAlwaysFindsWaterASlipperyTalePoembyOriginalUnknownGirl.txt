She asked her a few questions
Shuffled the cards
Laid out the deck before her
“Pick a few won’t you? ”
“Ah yes”, she said, “was he a water sign? ”
“Yes” was her reply
“And you? ”
“Yes, water too”
“Ah, now I see…
When water meets water, you know;
It just flows,
Flows into one another
No seams, no edges, smooth without ridges
But when water meets fire
Well that’s a whole different desire
Water gets heated up by fire
But water can put fire out”
With that, she could agree and had no doubt
“What you need” she said, “is a good earth sign”
“Get away from all this water and fire,
Too much drowning, too much heat
What you need is some earth for you to meet”
So the mermaid shimmied up onto the rocks
Flipping her pearlescent tail on the shore
And twinkled her pretty shells
But the sea wanted her more……..
