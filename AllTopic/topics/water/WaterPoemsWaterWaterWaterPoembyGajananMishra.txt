Water water water and water
Give me water in this hot summer.
And water has atom, water has favor,
And water water water and water
Water as cloud, and water drops
In action, in creation and
Water is the symbol of supreme devotion.
Water, water. water and water
And in water there is true love
That is flowing within and outside.
