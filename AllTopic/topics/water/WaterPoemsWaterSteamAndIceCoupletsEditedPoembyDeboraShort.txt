I am the contrails in the sky
Transporting your love to my heart-felt joy
I am those rolling white riffles splashing
Across those ancient glistening granite rocks
I am the warm tingling steaming massage
Sensate-ly refreshing your tired soul
I am that energizing frozen cube
That cools that sweet tea you sip on our porch
I am the main ingredient carrying
Life-giving nutrients to your keen mind
I am the visible steam rising up
That prepares your scrumptious wild rice tonight
I am those fluffy white clouds high above
That sponge down the dust into the earth
I am that which keeps your Force Five afloat
So you can sail on to your newer dreams
I am your frozen-ed winter delight
Magical crystals spun during the night
I am that drink your ravenous soul desires
Sprinkled grace, His most dear promise-d gift
