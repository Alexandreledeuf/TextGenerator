Red Muscadel – I know it will give a
headache tomorrow, but since my
left ear is sore, I don’t care anymore,
the taste is beautiful, sweet and
wonderful, how could I sleep
without alcohol?
All day long I tried to fix the ear,
but all in vain – at least I’ve changed
the situation; from somewhat bad to
completely intolerable – there goes my
plan to work tonight, with this pressure
and pain, my only gain Is a
perfectly watertight excuse
to refrain from working
tonight…
After determining that my excuse for not working
was infallible, I felt free of responsibility – and
therefore happily did the translation without any
pressure; with this painful left ear I could not go
to sleep and books seem quite boring right now –
the best are the Apocrypha, telling the story of
Jesus’ boyhood – he was a real cowboy; his clay
animals came alive and devoured the others..
The crocodile has been dethroned, no more reading
at top speed, I shall concentrate on translation -
no more gulping down knowledge, grasping only
half, this year I’ll slowly cover every subject;
translate at a snail’s pace to make sure I get
everything right – if worse came to the worst, I
could always die – so first let us try to harness
all powers on behalf -
…of Survival…
