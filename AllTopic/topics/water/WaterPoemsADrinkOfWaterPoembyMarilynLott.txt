Life is difficult for so many people
Now and back through the ages
Sometimes existence seems like a test
Hardship at many different stages
Through the Great Depression
Very few jobs were to be had
Some folks actually starved to death
Stories surface that are so very sad
Though most people try to do their best
Sometimes it just doesn’t seem enough
Circumstances create situations
That makes life extremely tough
When there’s no food, there’s usually water
A life-giving part of the land
A necessity that God has given us
Helping the weak strong enough to stand
He gives us the beautiful flowers
A drink of water to keep them alive
Sometimes they get just enough
That they are barely able to survive
And that’s just the way life is at times
It may not be what we would wish for
But if God gives us a drink of water
It sustains us for what’s yet in store!
