Water, water you’re good for me
You help me hydrate and make me pee
Sodium and you are meant to be
Water, water I must have thee
I drink you in and you come out
Can’t have too much or little without a doubt
Water, water you’re clear and cool
You help brake food down into stool
When my kidneys scream and shout
You reabsorb and balance out
Water, water when I’m thirsty
You with fluoride keep teeth more than three
I must have you to survive
Cause without you I’m not alive
Water, water so plain to see
I’ll drink you till the end of me
