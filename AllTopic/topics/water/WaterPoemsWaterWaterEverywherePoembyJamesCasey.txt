Water Water Everywhere
Water water everywhere and not a drop to drink
That is of course until   this lovely ship does sink
There is nothing to compare to a sunrise     while at sea
Oh how I've missed those moments       special just to me
Sunrises on the ocean with        no one else around
Seems to show God's near us   without a single sound
Sunsets are special too,   dull moments they are not
Beautiful red  colors emitting hues   not too soon forgot
Night time on the ocean      brings many things anew
On moonless skies it seems so cold with just a hint of dew
Of course those starry nights are     quite a sight to see
The beauty of those twinklers was fashioned    just for me
I'll always miss the wonders the stars have    brought to me
And when I die I'd like my ashes spread far,   far out to sea
