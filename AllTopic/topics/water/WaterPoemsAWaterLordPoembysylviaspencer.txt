See him hover, over river and pond
just like a fairy waving a wand. He looks
quite stunning this graceful thing, flying
around on brightly coloured wing.
He can sometimes flys up to fifty miles an
hour. Then lands like kamikaze on a lilly pad
flower. He has a huge great appetite when he
starts to feed, feeding of the larvae within the
marsh reed. 'The Devils Darning Needle' he
has sometimes been called, but in the eyes of
a nature lover he is  'A Water Lord'
He is great to watch, with his serenity and charm
when the ponds are still and the rivers calm.
Rich in colour with a lace like wing, he is the Dragonfly
'The Proud Emperor King'
