As I stood upon the brink of life
And looked into the murky depths
I knew my soul would soon be lost
If I took just one more faltering step
And I longed so strongly for it
Nothing seemed to matter much
‘till I heard a swelling chorus
In the wind and I was touched
There’s a sound across the water
Calling me…..calling me
There’s a sound across the water
Calling me…..calling me
So I listened to the music
On that far and distant shore
And it lifted me and set me free
To finally see what I’d come for
And that sound across the water
Set me free…..set me free
And that sound across the water
Set  me free…..set me free
And I took that step into the dark
Knowing I would not fall
And I floated oh so gently
Towards that far off beckoning call
