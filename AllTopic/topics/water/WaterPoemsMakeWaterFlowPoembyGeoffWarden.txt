How, in such moment of time,
Doth thou come unto me,
Delivering such colours radiance,
Liken unto the falls of Niagara,
Filling voids of empathic rooms.
How, in such moment of space,
Doth thou reach the scope,
Of the depth of my pardon,
Liken unto birds paradise,
Giving voice unto melting need.
How, in such movement of spirit,
Doth thy empathic touch,
Deliver me unto heighten joy,
Felt only at the pinpoint second,
Emotions quake has release.
Only Thou could bring such eclipse.....
Only thou could make water flow.......
