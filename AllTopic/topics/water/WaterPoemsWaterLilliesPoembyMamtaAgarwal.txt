As I quietly enter
The portals of the Habitat center,
To attend the Delhi Poetree session.
I simply cannot mention
My sense of wonder and disbelief,
At spotting water lilies in the midst of glass and concrete.
The sight of half closed mauve flowers,
Growing in a pool of stagnant water,
Green serrated leaves afloat
My riveted eyes couldn’t fail to note.
Petals coming together at dusk as if in a greeting.
Perhaps, to welcome me to the meeting.
The sight filled me with ecstasy
I stood there awed by the beauty,
Pleased and filled with serenity.
This is poetry without words,
That can’t be heard.
But the eyes can see
And the heart can feel
And the soul can rejoice
Without hearing a voice.
The memory lingers in my mind,
As I lie down to unwind.
