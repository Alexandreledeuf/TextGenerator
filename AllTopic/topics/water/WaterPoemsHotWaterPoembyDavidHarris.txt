Sometimes we get in hot water
over things we say inadvertently.
You’ll say something with a double meaning
and you can bet your bottom dollar
someone will take it the wrong way.
Your name will be mud
and you’ll be in hot water again
over things you say.
They either throw mud in your face
or laugh until their socks fall off.
