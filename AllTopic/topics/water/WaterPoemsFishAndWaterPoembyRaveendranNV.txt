Me, very fishy, unable to understand water
Move about in search of an answer
They say water, water everywhere
But what is water they don’t say
Where is water, I don’t see, don’t feel
I move all right, so what?
Water, water everywhere
I don’t drink a drop
Let me ask the giant fish
The grand sire, who knows better
And he tells without water
You can live not a moment …
