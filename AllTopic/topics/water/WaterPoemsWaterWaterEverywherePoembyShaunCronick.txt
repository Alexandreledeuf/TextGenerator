Water, water everywhere,
And not a drop to drink.
The river Ely burst its banks,
Making many a welsh heart sink.
A flood of biblical proportions,
Well, perhaps the odd drop or two.
Has drowned our cherished museum,
But the fine staff all came through.
All that was so painfully yesterday,
For the dark waters have ebbed away.
And so our robust museum of the year,
Is radiantly open this St David's Day!
