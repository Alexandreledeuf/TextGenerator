Suspended above
Time
on a little rickety bridge
that almost
touches the water
we watch
time & time again
as water
caught & curved
by rocks
& boulders
forms a woman
& then un-forms
her
here
breasts appear
and then float away
there
the curve of a hip
and faster now
there
her
Sex
urgent & demanding
shaping
& un-shaping
itself.
“Reminds me of me! ”
You say.
“Yeah...”
I say
“...all the way! ”
We return to the hotel
where we recreate
Mother Nature.
Me all hard rock
& boulder
you a woman
made of water.
