Diving,
into clear water.
The light
hurts my eyes,
the warmth
protects me
from myself.
I see your hand
in the water.
An open hand,
waiting for me
to grab it,
to grab life,
to grab fear,
to embrace you.
The shore
can no longer be seen.
I float
weightless,
fearless,
into your arms.
