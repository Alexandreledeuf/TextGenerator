My water ski, she is a beauty
Now she’s painted bright red and black
I can think of nothing much better
Than to go out and give her a crack.
I’m sure she’ll skim over the water
As some sea birds skim over the sea
And I hope that while she’s a’skimming
She’ll think kindly of waiting for me.
As her creator I’m sure I deserve it
For the hours of toil that I’ve spent
In planing, and sanding and painting
And getting the bloomin end bent!
