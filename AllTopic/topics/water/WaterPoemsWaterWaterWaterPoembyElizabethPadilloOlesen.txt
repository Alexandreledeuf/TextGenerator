Water for life
to quench thirst
to wash away dirt
to sustain life
if food is denied.
Water, water, water,
wrapped up by toxic chemicals
filled with lead and copper;
bringing illness and rashes,
fear and hazard to everyone's life.
Oh, water, water, water
What has mankind done
to make you so unkind?
