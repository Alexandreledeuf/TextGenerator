water the world
before anything
else came along
from the water,
i heard record of things
old and new
they unveil them
to me with its
tingling sounds
the piano nature's
hands have played
since creation began
if there is anything
i wish my poem
to flow, it would
be water - in the
stream, river, sea,
waterfall,  under the ice,
wherever it is,
water that harbours
a life of its own
and within it
a million lives
- seeps its way
into everybody's heart
it fools all agelbra
master with its agility
the only medium that
can take any shape
any form vapour,
snow and ice
if there is anything
i wish my poem to run
it would be the water
splashing, streaming,
swirling, splitting, spilling,
cornering, dancing down
reader's heart
water, in it are secrets
of news both good and bad
- of the present, of the future -
if you would just  let your heart,
soul and mind flow with its rhythm
you could hear it playing out
all the secrets it held since
the beginning of time in the
most delightful tune
