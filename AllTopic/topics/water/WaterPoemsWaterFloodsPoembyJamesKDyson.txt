modern day in the shade
feels like hazy, blue, pouring rain
sitting under chipmunk filled trees
watching clouds and thinking about fleas
fleas are small but not as tiny
I am fine, but please, don't mind me
growing tadpoles in the pond
just a patient, won't take long
alcohol is in my blood
inject an overdose
when water floods
the find is dry
she lied again
I don't know why?
I do know when.
