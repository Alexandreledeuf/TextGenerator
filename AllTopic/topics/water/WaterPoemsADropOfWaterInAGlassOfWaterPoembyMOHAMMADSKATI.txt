The world is mostly water, but                                         Do each of us get a drop of water                                       In a glass of water anytime and anywhere?                               We're thirsty because we can not get                                     Just a drop of water in a glass of water!                               Some people have a lot of pure water in                                    Pretty tanks and in pretty bottles of water and                           There are some people who die because they're thirsty                             And they can not get even a drop of water!                                       It's a shame upon the whole world because some                            They get the best water and some die because of                               Lack of water anytime, anywhere, and everywhere!                               Where is the water we want? Where is the H2O?                                Life is useless with water! The pretty lands will                            Die, the animals will die, and we will die without water!                 A drop plus another drop equal two pretty drops and so on, but            Where are the other pretty drops that heaven drop to us!                       Life is going to die if we don't take care of our water on the           Surface of our pretty earth and everything around us!                   We will die if we don't keep our water well because of a lot of            Troubles arising from our mistakes and global warming!
