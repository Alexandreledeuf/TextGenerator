Down in the water
by the edge of the river
where time stands still,
.....if only  forever.
Down in the water
by the edge of the river
where I buried all
that was ever childhood
Where I let it go,
where it bends and meanders,
twisting along as the years went past.
Seemingly calm, but beneath the surface
its hidden whirlpools, a sweeping current!
Down in the water,
I left the edge of the river,
as I looked down
for my soul at the bottom.
Deep in the water!
swept away by the  river! ,
I drowned in life,
......sinking forever.
