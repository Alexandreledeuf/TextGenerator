Water water turbulent water
No water in future
Try to live without water
A drop of water you can not find
Here there except in media
Imagine image of a thirsty man
And beast and bird and parched
And cracked earth
No water in sea in ocean
In village cities industries population
Water water turbulent water
O my brother, save water
For your son and daughter
If you want them to be here.
