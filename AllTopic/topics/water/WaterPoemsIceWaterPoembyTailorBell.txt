Here on the surface of the sun
Its hard to remember what you were concerned over
Ten thousand degrees or more
Inside hosts of hot-house cooks abound
To stay cool you have to move about
Stroll around some, maybe
Over by the magnetic flux zone
Note to self:  Pickup some nice shades at the drugstore
