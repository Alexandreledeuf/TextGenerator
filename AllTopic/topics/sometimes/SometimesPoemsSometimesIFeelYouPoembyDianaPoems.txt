Sometimes I feel you
Your presence
Tickling my neck
Sometimes I feel you
Waking up
Feeling my Sweat drip
I saw you
Sometimes I reach for you
My hand stretching
My muscles stiffening
I cannot get to you
Sometimes I talk to you
My eyes closed
In the middle of the night
When my body sleeps
And my mind does not
Sometimes I feel you
Dripping from the sky
You are lonely
You seem sad
You bring weather
That makes my bones weak
Sometimes I feel you
Through my window
Gently stroking the blinds
Sometimes I hear you
Whistling through the air
Creating a tornado of despair
Sometimes I grieve for you
Your life was too short
When you left this world
I wasn't even born
But, you are not a stranger
You are my angel
And when you cry
You bring rain
And when you smile
The clouds move
Like your lips do
And the sunshine peaks through
Sometimes I feel you
Through black and white pictures
Your eyes gazing at me
Seeing the creation your daughter has made
You try hard to smile
Behind a garden
You have tamed
Only soon
Your garden will no longer be in your hands
Your eyes dry up
Your flowers dry up
Your hands no longer tame gardens on Earth
Sometimes I feel you
Through my mothers garden
Sometimes I taste you
Through my mothers recipes
Sometimes I see you
Through my mothers eyes
