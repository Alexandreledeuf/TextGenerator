He only lives for work and drinking for these are his passions in life
And when he goes home from the local he argues with Betty his wife
She no longer cooks him his supper she tells him you can help yourself
In the fridge you'll find eggs and bacon and there's coffee
and tea on the shelf.
Their marriage as such it is over they live in the same house that is all
though Betty will talk of the good days when happier times she recall,
When their children were growing up in the sixties and Joe had drink under control
Until the love between them faded and boredom of their marriage took toll.
When asked how come she still lives with him? she says where I live I will stay
I'm sixty five years on a pension and my hair is silvery gray
And though we live under the same roof and we argue almost every day
There's nothing of love left between us we have gone our separate way.
Sometimes love does not last a lifetime despite what the romantics might say
And the story of Joseph and Betty is a story of love in decay,
He once showed her lots of affection but that was a long time ago
And though they live under the same roof no love left between her and Joe.
