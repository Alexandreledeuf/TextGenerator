Glorious long days
hang from the sun until dark,
beauty stacked upon beauty
and all of it for Love.
Vast prairie of day
with another one to follow,
the trees burning fires in the sky.
Time is a lazy, tame horse
and leisure a profession.
No imperative exists
but to drift like a cloud
through the sky of my day,
doing whatever I love.
