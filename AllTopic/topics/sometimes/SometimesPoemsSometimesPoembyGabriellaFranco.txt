Sometimes, I'm a little rude, but just sometimes
Sometimes, I guess I can be creative, but just sometimes
Sometimes, I feel on top of the world, but only sometimes
Sometimes, I feel like I'm all alone, but only sometimes
Sometimes, my life is spiraling out of control, but really, sometimes
Sometimes, my heart, I swear stops beating, but then again, sometimes
Sometimes, my heart is so full it could burt, but just sometimes
Sometimes, I feel like I've got it under control, but only sometimes
Sometimes, I truly know you love me, but just sometimes
But, my love, with all of my heart, mind, and soul. Forever and for always, I'll always love you
