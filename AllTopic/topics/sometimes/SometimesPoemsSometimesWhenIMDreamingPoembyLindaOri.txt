Sometimes when I'm dreaming..........
My world is bright and clear -
I know my heart,
I know my part,
No hesitance or fear;
Sometimes when I'm dreaming..........
I wander through the night -
To distant lands,
I grasp the hands
Of poverty and plight;
Sometimes when I'm dreaming..........
I have the power to cure -
The weak of heart,
Lives torn apart,
My faith is strong and pure;
Sometimes when I'm dreaming..........
The answers come to light -
Which path to take,
Which choice to make,
No question which is right;
Sometimes when I'm dreaming..........
I feel you standing near -
You calm my storm,
Your heart is warm,
Your love for me is clear;
Sometimes when I'm dreaming..........
I just enjoy the view -
I'm in my space,
My perfect place,
That's when I dream of you.
