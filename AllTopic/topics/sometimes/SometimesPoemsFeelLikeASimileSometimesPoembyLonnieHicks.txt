I feel like a train sometimes
that can't get no locomotin.'
My wheels lumber
and my Ideals get stuck
in sideways roller motions.
I feel like the moon sometimes
beautiful but dead.
Feel like thinking sometimes
but get tangled up in emotions.
Feel like a bird sometimes
remembering how to soar.
Feel like sleeping sometimes
and not getting up,
being in bed for a while.
Feel like Christmas when
someone gives me a smile.
Feel like feeling more
on certain days and times.
Feel like talking deep
and thinking light
laughing loud
and quiet.
Feel like feeling like
my best days
sometimes.
Feel like is feeling like
if a good poem rhymes
sometimes.
Feel like is feeling like
if the rhythm beats in time,
if my heart skips to music quips
and rejoins at the metered line.
Feel like
is feeling like
feeling is ok;
but feeling good or bad
without that like
is better;
well..
like superior.
Like ok?
