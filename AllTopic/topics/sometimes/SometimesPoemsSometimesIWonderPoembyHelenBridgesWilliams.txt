Sometimes I wonder why I feel I
what I feel
whether it is pain, sadness,
joy or madness
Why must I feel it all so deeply
emotions on a never ending
circle filled with blue and gray
Light trickling in at its own
convenience to play
Is this the destiny for which we
create our won existence or can
we change the circles to squares
Triangles or octagons
with a brighter beginnings and
visible ends
A life with meaning
pleasurable and rewarding
Without oppression, suggestion
or reprimand
Is this the reality of the
Conclusion of our lives
or merely the beginning of
destiny.
