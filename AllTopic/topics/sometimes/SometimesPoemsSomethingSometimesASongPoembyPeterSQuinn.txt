Here I am with my heart
Giving what I can give
Every peace moments whiles
So much giving from their smiles
I have you as you have me
Inside love and outside out
Everything most people talk about
I donâ€™t want to show loneliness
Though it greets me every day
Sometimes I feel all with pleasure inside
While the shadows away will glide
Every friend indeed needs a friend
Giving their need and efforts lend
Sometimes I feel all with pleasure inside
While the shadows away will glide
Every friend indeed needs a friend
Giving their need and efforts lend
Here I am with my heart
Walking miles of inside roads
Feeling something to do or start
With every mood in down low loads
All my friends are just like this
Feelings lonely in what they miss
Sometimes I feel all with pleasure inside
While the shadows away will glide
Every friend indeed needs a friend
Giving their need and efforts lend
Here I am with my heart
Giving what I can give
Here I am with my heart
Walking miles of inside roads
