Sometimes I just sit quietly
and put my mind in neutral gear.
Set my imagination free
and wait for visions to appear
The visions which inspire me
to pick my pencil up and write.
About the dreamscapes I can see,
which I describe in black and white.
Though those who read my poetry
use their imagination to
visualise quite easily.
The scenes I try to share with you.
Sometimes I fail, sometimes succeed
in entertaining all who read.
