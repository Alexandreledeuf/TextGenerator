Sometimes In Supplication
Sometimes in supplication,
Or just in earnest prayer,
I kneel beside my bed, and then
I feel Him lift my care.
But other times Iâ€™m lying,
Cradled snugly in my bed,
When joyfilled words of thanks I raise
By thoughts within my head.
What comfort, this, to realize
No matter what the case,
He sees and He does not despise
The position or the face.
Sometimes my weary eyelids
Force me into sleep
Before my prayer is ended,
Without my thanks complete.
Then, when I wake refreshed once more,
I thank Him once again
That what was hours of sleep to me
Was just a pause to Him.
