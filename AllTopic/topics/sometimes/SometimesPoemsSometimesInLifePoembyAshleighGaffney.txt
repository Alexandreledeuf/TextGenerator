Sometimes in life
You find a special friend
Someone who changes your life
Just by being part of it
Someone who makes you laugh
Until you can’t stop
Someone who makes you believe
That there really is good in the world
Someone who convinced you
That there really is an unlocked door
Just waiting for you to open it
This is forever friendship
When you’re down
And the world seems dark and empty
Your forever friend lifts you up in spirit
And makes that dark and empty world
Suddenly seem bright and full
Your forever friend gets you through
The hard times, the sad times
And the confused times
Your forever friend holds you hand
And tells you that
Everything is going to be ok.
And if you find such a friend
You feel happy and complete
Because you need not to worry
You have a forever friend for life
And forever has no end
