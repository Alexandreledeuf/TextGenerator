Sometimes i feel like im left out,
sometimes.
Sometimes I don't like my life,
just sometimes.
Sometimes I feel like the world
should be different,
but only sometimes.
Sometimes I feel creative,
just sometimes.
Sometimes I just think there's a missing piece,
only sometimes.
Sometimes I feel like people don't like me,
just sometimes.
Sometimes I feel like the world is after me,
but just only sometimes
Sometimes Sometimes Sometimes
