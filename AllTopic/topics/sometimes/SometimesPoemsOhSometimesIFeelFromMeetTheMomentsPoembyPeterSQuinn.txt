Sometimes I can’t find what surrounds me
For it’s so vast in its everyday going to be
Full of its time’s from past gone memory
Stuck inside this love that once was free
Reaching to gray skies up high
Filling empty spaces that surrounds
Living for hours that die
Into the dreams that shall on fly
Onto the giving of notions that mounds
I felt I had somewhere to reach out and contact
Bring in those longings that age had blacked
Something once ready even if still in its intact
Living its emptiness that nothing could enact
Reaching to gray skies up high
Filling empty spaces that surrounds
Living for hours that die
Into the dreams that shall on fly
Onto the giving of notions that mounds
Oh sometimes I feel I’m lost there somewhere
A dream in dim mislaid without its day prayer
With only behaviors no one could prepare
Always so unfilled and always so unfair
Reaching to gray skies up high
Filling empty spaces that surrounds…
