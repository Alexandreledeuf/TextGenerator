i
I donâ€™t smile
You may think I am giving you
The permission
To think
That I really do not mean
What I say
With this grin on my face
ii
I stand my ground now
No backing off
On a wishy-washy
I give weight
To my prime intentions
iii
I tell the truth
I will tell you what I feel
I will tell you that I am not comfortable
With what you are doing
iv
Tell me I am silly
I will agree
I am not a little bit touchy
You are right I am
Now take the wind out of your sails
v
I do not have fingers
To point
To make you more defensive
I have only my heart
To tell you how I feel
Who are you anyway
To be blamed?
vi
I will make up a list of handy excuses
To see what is clearly going on
Before I put myself in the fray
vii
I am not afraid
To change my mind
Whenever I want to
In a minute or two
I may still have time
To tell you
That sometimes I do not
Honor commitments.
now, i will be happier
