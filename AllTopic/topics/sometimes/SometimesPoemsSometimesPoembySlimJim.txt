Sometimes I feel my life’s just a big nightmare
Sometimes I wish I could stand up to my greatest fear
Sometimes I wish it all were new
Sometimes I wish it were happening to you
Sometimes I wish people could only see
Another side of me
Sometimes I wish I were never born
So I wouldn’t be here for you to scorn
Sometimes I wonder why I’m only a friend
Sometimes I wonder will anyone care if my life came to an end
Sometimes I wish you were in my shoes,
So you could see life from my point of view
Sometimes I wonder if I'm just too late
Sometimes I wonder if there’s such a thing as “Fate”
Sometimes I wonder why there’s night and day
Sometimes I wonder why my life’s this way
Sometimes I wish I could jump the track
Sometimes I wish I could just go back
Sometimes I wish I had a risk worth the take
Sometimes I wish I could erase every mistake
Sometimes I pretend everything is fine
Sometimes I wish I was on the frontline
Sometimes I wish life would turn out right
Sometimes I wish I could win the fight
But nothing is right and nothing is fine
So I stand-alone and wait for the end of time,
If you wish to join me go ahead
Cause in the end we’ll all be dead.
