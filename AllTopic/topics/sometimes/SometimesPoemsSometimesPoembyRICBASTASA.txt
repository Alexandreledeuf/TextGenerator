sometimes i feel
so stupid and so stupid
that i like being called stupid
by other stupid people out
there who think that
they are not stupid
sometimes i like to laugh
at myself and call myself
crazy and behave like i
am crazy and then suddenly
a man comes next to me
and asks me
why am i happy?
i think he is not stupid anymore.
