Sometimes the skies of tomorrow look bright
crystal blue and full of hope
telling you the best is on its way..
Sometimes the waters of yesterday seem black
showing nothing but the pain you've felt
the tears you've cried; the sorrow you're forced to hide..
Sometimes the world of Today seems revealing
granting you a moment of peace before you take your next step
allowing you for just this one heartbeat to let go.
