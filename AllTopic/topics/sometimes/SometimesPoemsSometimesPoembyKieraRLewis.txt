Sometimes I want to laugh
Sometimes I want to cry
Sometimes I get bad
Sometimes I have to lie
Sometimes I watch the sun
Sometimes I watch the rain
Sometimes I feel the joy
Sometimes I feel the pain
Sometimes I am fine
Sometimes I get lonely
Sometimes I need friends
Sometimes I need you only
Sometimes I like to talk
Sometimes I like to write
Sometimes I seem weak
Sometimes I use all my might
But guess what...
It just be like that sometimes!
