there are times when i'm hunted by my own thoughts
i feel real bad, ususally i keep ignoring it until..... i can't take it anymore
.......
So sometimes i want to cry
i don't know why
but i do
sometimes i want to walk
i don't know where to
but i do
sometimes i want to write
i don't know what
but i do
sometimes i talk to myself
i don't know why
but i do
sometimes i want to stay alone
i don't know why
but i do
sometimes i pretend to be happy
well, i know why          (coz m sad)
and i do
sometimes i want to sing
i don't know what
but i do
sometimes i just want to die
i don't know why
but I DON'T! ! ! !
