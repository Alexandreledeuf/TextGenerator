sometimes you just dont want to talk to anyone
sometimes you dont want to hear anything
sometimes you cant do anything right
sometimes you dont want to feel anything
sometimes all you feel is pain
sometimes you dont want to see anything
sometimes you dont want anybody to look at you
sometimes you want to be alone
sometimes you dont want to live
sometimes you just cant take life anymore
sometimes you just want it to end
sometimes you just want to stop
sometimes........ is all the time for me
