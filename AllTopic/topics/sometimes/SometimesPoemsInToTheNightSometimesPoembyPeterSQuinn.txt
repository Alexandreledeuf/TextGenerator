In to the night my dreams go
Light that is mellow and falling
I have forgotten their glow
And each footstep strolling
Make me now happy tomorrow
Into their workings right
There must never be again sorrow
To a low hours flight
Dream must stay and never leave
Only be ours to give
Throw away here now its heave
Let's come together and live
Night felt so close sometimes
In to the dark and forgotten
Moments of well being climbs
From those steps often trottin'
Let it not happen again
Felling that lonesome gray
Then has my hope been in vain
Left every outlook astray
Night is sometimes like shelter
Giving its dark compassion
In to its many shadows welter
With voices of hope clashin'
