Sometimes I think, just maybe I miss you
The way you were overly concerned,
The way you just couldn’t be away from me,
The way you always listened to everything I said,
Sometimes I think I miss that
Sometimes I think, just maybe I love you
The way we can talk about anything,
The way you smile, like you haven’t a care in the world,
The way I can’t seem to let you go,
Sometimes I think I love that
Sometimes I think, just maybe I like you
The way everyone thinks you’re dumb when you’re not
The way you surprise me when you say things
The way you’re so awkwardly cute
Sometimes I think I like that
Sometimes I think, just maybe I’m meant to be alone
Meant to always search for love but never find it
Meant to be content all by myself
Meant to cry at every romance movie
Sometimes I think I’m meant for me and only me
And sometimes I think, just maybe I’m wrong.
