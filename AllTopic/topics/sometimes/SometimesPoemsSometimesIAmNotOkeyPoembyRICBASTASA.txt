Sometimes i have tantrums too
like i have
deeper depressions
sharper tongues like that of a
Philippine king cobra
willing to spit my venom
my fatal bite
to an innocent passer-by
we all have the breeding of some sphinx
traceable to the lines
of some Medusas and cyclops
and dragons
do not deny the nerves and veins
of the devil still clinging
to our flesh, running and so alive
we have all these sometimes
like some storms and tornadoes
and flash floods and
volcanic eruptions and
tsunamis.... the forces of nature
tattooed in our skins
stained in our brains
just give me time
while i write the poetry of anger, and madness and
hate,
do not even wait as i simmer down to indifference
leave me alone
in my destructive destinations
wait, and wait some more
if you have love at all,
let me go, let me vent, let me shout, let me explode
for tonight
when the moon is full, i lay tired on the grass by the
tranquil pool,
still trees, cool but undisturbed by any ripple
when all these pass,
come, share a drink with me
come, let us again talk in whispers
then some smiles
then a loud laughter
we shall be
always together, when all these bad things are over
