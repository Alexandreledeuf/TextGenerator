Sometimes I fear, I am losing my mind
When I find myself talking to myself
I need something better to heal the pain
Writing about it is no longer enough
There's nothing left for me on which to rely
There's no one around to cry if I cry
Nobody cares for hearing my crazy life's song
Nobody cares whether I am right or wrong
Thereâ€™s only me
I sing to me in the night sitting here alone
Closest to me are the moon and the stars
Dancing with me are the leaves, the grasses
I see another shooting star to wish up on
Just a silent prayer, for a better day
This strange place won't have me
Where is the Love? !
