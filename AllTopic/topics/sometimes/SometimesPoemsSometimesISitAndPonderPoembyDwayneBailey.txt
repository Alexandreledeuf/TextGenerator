Sometimes I just sit and ponder,
what the true meaning of lifes all about;
Try and figure out my insucurites,
and the reason Im so full of doubt,
Maybe Im too hard on myself,
with the pressure I apply from within;
Maybe I want too much to fast,
here comes doubt creeping in again.
How can I find a balance in life,
where I float with an even keal?
Not worring about the future,
or losing for life its zeal?
