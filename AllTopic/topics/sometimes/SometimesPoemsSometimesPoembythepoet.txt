Here I am tonight,
I know it’s not alright,
Something’s just not right…
When I look into your eyes,
I can see all the lies.
Sometimes,
I wish this not be,
Sometimes,
I don’t want to believe,
Sometimes,
That we’re not to be,
Sometimes,
When I think about our memories……
Where you,
Lock your arms around me,
Letting our minds go free,
When you,
Sit by my side under the tree,
Hand in hand we can see,
The moonlight shining ever bright as can be,
How you, sing the song of our lullaby…
Sometimes,
I hum along this vivid tone,
Sometimes,
When I’m all alone,
Sometimes,
I still dream about you,
Sometimes,
All I can think of is you…
Since your trembling voice,
Muted……
When the sorrow siren,
Ended……
You left me in the rain,
Jaded……
When I last saw your face,
Faded……
