Sometimes I wish that I didn't feel like this
that my heart didn't control me the way it does
that everytime i saw your face I didn't smile
That your very laugh didn't warm my heart
that i could just leave, walk away
that you meant nothing to me
but you do, you mean so much
everyday it grows even stronger than before
it's forceful more than I ever thought i could endure
it's confusing and I don't know why
Happiness and pain reside
tears and laughs fill
too much to keep still
Somtimes I wish I were braver
that my fear didn't hold me back from what i wanted to do
that i could say what i really want
is you
