Sometimes in Life
Sometimes in life, I wonder just what I'm doing?
The energy's there, but the trouble is brewing.
I seem to have, no control of myself,
I just turned away, now I'm with someone else.
The days just fly by, yet there's so much to do.
I look to a face, to just pull me through.
Time just can't wait, so it just marches on.
All of the things, just, seem to be wrong?
Just turned my back and everything's gone...........
Sometimes in life, I don't believe what I see.
Are all of these things, just part of me?
I pick up the pieces, but some seem to be missing,
I look for the answers, but it feels like I'm guessing?
Sometimes in life, you can't get what you need.
You feel so empty, yet there's nothing to feed.
Your soul feels so empty, nothing can fill the hole.
It's hard to find direction, when you just don't know.
Sometimes in life, I think I know my way?
It's just around the corner, I might make it today?
Though things seem hopeless, there's always faith,
Carries me back, to a place that is safe.
Sometimes in life, there seems something better.
But the rain just comes and you just get wetter.
Things always appear better, on the other side.
At least until you get there, then you must hide.
Sometimes in life, I just wanted the truth.
But it was surrounded by lies and they just got loose.
The answers don't match, the questions I find.
Uncertainty robs, my peace of mind..............
