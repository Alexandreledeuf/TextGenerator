Sometimes I like to try
Curl into a bottle and hide
From those thoughts about me
Those thoughts which haunt
Those annoying thoughts
Those keep you awake thoughts
Sometimes I spend hours writing
Days taken over by the tap, tapping
Of the keyboard or the scratching
Of a pen against paper
Sometimes I don't write for days
Sometimes it's weeks, I hate those times
Sometimes I listen to poetry readings
Perhaps too lazy to read myself
Or just enjoying another voice
I like to imagine others reading
That which I call my poetry
Sometimes I do all of the above
And Sometimes, well I guess
Sometimes is never enough
