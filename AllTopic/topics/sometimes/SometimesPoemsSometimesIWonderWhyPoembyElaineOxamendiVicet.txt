Unrequited Love
Sometimes I wonder why I go on loving you
This way…
Words of a song that is a recurring decimal to me.
On my return from an extended visit I became ill
The cure was lie with my parents
74 & 75
To feel secure and comfortable.
This is gnawing feeling
To be secure and comfortable.
To know that someone cares for me the way I do
At 32 up to 74 and more.
Why do I go on feeling this way? ....
The embrace of an arm at night
The warmth that emanates from glances
The gentle touches as hands brush when we pass.
The silence shared
The bickering
The share power of communicating.
Still I wonder why, I go on loving you this way.
Each day another test
Each day another life time moment lost.
Each day life grows shorter
Each day I long for this lover.
My throat/chokes
My eyes swell
I am full
Little streams flow
Once again
When will this be over?
I want 32 to 74 and more.
The beauty I see
I witness
Between 74,75
Love between my parents is better than …..(sign)
I don’t really wonder why I go on feeling this way
It’s love.
But is it UNREQUITED LOVE?
It’s like a recurring decimal
I fall between the cracks
Just another sad song
Drinking up the night in a lonely room
So the songwriter says
I say
ENOUGH
I Want More
We deserve to grow old together
