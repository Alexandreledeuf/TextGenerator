Raised to believe...
If they wished reality not to exist,
They could ignore it away!
Or kneel on knees to pray to false symbols
And/or deities with their likenesses
And ask 'them' to remove reality
Out of their way.
Since they can not fathom,
Those they have chosen
To defame by slander,
To 'be' and 'speak' of truth!
They actually hold them responsible...
For their quality of life,
Crumbling slowly in decay!
And nothing about their existence,
Is based on having a consciousness.
With morals, respect or concern conveyed!
And complaints of the artificialness of it...
They beg of their 'god' to keep it that way!
But the GOD who has created them...
Has always been about change!
And sometimes that is drastic.
At most times that change comes...
And no longer can be delayed.
