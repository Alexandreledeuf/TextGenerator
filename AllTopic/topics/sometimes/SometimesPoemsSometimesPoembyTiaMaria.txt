Sometimes there are no words to say
why a heart should feel this way.
No reason to even question why
Just be still, don't even try.
Sometimes thinking holds no thought
Life's just a net in which we're caught
No use in struggling to be free
We cannot plan our destiny
Sometimes we just have to listen
and just go by our intuition
No need to try and justify
A love we simply can't deny
