Sometimes I'm up
Sometimes I'm down
Sometimes I smile
Sometimes I frown
Depends on what I've done
Depends on who I've seen
Depends if you are nice
Depends if you are mean
Sometimes I'm clever
Sometimes I'm thick
Sometimes I endeavour
Sometimes I retreat
Depends on who I'm talking to
Depends on what I say
Depends on how I'm feeling
Depends if I'm too weak
Sometimes I'm happy
Sometimes I'm sad
Sometimes I want to change
Sometimes I want to be me
Depends on those around me
Depends upon the news
Depends if I'm helpless
Depends who else I could be
