Sometimes I wish I could
Break the barriers
And free myself from this golden cage
And become a free bird
Free of the worries of the haunting past
And of the unknown future
Flying in the vast sky
Sans any pains or sorrows
Sometimes I wish I could
Rest in the soft clouds
Freeing my heart of the burdens
And become weightless
And floating with the clouds
Quenching my thirst
With the chilled droplets
Forgetting all my rage and anger
