if with memory remind those words,
unscheduled touch, that smell, dust
of the road, appointed out with duty,
I don't know
what we would find years later - perhaps
this absurd nonsensicality which a fate
gave us, but irreparable already now
mistake, which at one time was with choice
thought over, and maybe exactly something,
what we aren't able to live today without (?)
whether the time causes that we are still
but at least together, sometimes being
completely beside (?)
