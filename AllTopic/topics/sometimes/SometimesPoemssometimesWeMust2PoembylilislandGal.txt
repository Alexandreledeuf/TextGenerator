Sometimes
We adapt in tranquility
Yet face the
Insolent society.
Sometimes
We get hurt
In order to grow.
Sometimes
We fail
In order to know.
Sometimes
We feel maturity
Yet unaware off
Our creativity.
Sometimes
We go through
The complexity
To maintain
Our originality.
Sometimes
Our visions broaden
When our eyes
Are washed away
With tears.
