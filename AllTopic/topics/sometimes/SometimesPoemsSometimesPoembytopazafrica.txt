sometimes i watch myself watching you
i don't know how i do it
it comes naturally as a heart beat
sometimes i catch you watching me
it makes my heart overflow with something sweet
sometimes we both look at each other at the same time as one another
it makes my eyes smile
and i know everytime i spend with you
is so worthwhile
