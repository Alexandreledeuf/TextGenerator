Sometimes it rains in deserts,
Sometimes it snows in June,
Sometimes a burning sun
Is cooled behind the moon.
Sometimes a classic's written,
Sometimes a poem's sung,
Sometimes the wisest words
Are spoken by the young.
Sometimes the treasure's golden,
Sometimes the victory's won,
Sometimes the road not taken
Is where the path begun.
Sometimes when all is rotten,
Sometimes when hope is gone,
Sometimes your foe is worthy
And helps you carry on.
Sometimes a miracle happens,
Sometimes the fear's misplaced,
Sometimes the hope that's lost
Is once again embraced.
Sometimes our tears are happy,
Sometimes the hate undone,
Sometimes the chains are broken
And the world stands up as one.
