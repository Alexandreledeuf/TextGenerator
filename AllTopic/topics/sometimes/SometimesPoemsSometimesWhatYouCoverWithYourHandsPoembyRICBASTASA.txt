sometimes what you cover with your hands
if they misinterpret that
is not really intended for hiding
not the selfishness of your very own fingers
but
if they only know it by heart
are offerings asking
if you too are ready and willing to give them
the way you cover things are manners of asking
are you also willing to give
and give wholeheartedly without asking for
anything in return?
sometimes let me tell you
when i cover some lovely parts of myself
which you misinterpret again as
utter selfishness
nay, it is not the way you see things
skin deep
stones protruding on the low
ebbing of the season
sometimes let me tell you
when i cover the most vulnerable portion of my being
it is, in truth, just a manner of my asking
if indeed, in itself, and by itself,
if your love is true.
