Sometimes it takes a tragedy
to help us see things clear,
and then we get a glimpse of life
without our loved ones here.
The busy days of real-life
go by with such a flash
and then you're in the hospital...
the whole world seems to crash.
We've dodged another bullet.
We're given one more day.
Let's make a promise to ourselves
to not forget to say...
Your breath comes forth just for me,
your lungs still rise and fall.
I'll always be beside you
with just a simple call.
The heat from you while sleeping
can take away my chills.
The way you keep me laughing
and showing me new thrills.
I know our days are numbered.
It has to end one day.
Please let it be many years from now
when one of us goes away.
