Take my dreams give them something
I don't know
It's just love inside this
I'll have to show - have to show
Everybody is doing something
And I just know how to sing
Love is sometimes crazy
When it comes to me
And my thoughts get hazy
When they are set to be
Questions asked never are
What they sometimes seem
Everything stays afar
Like a delusional dream
Don't ask me why - I can't tell you
I don't have the answers
There are no certainties to go to
I often have a dream to feel my way
But dreams don't live to become true
I'll make decisions that are up to me
And give the dreams I know
I'll try to be what I can be
In times that come and go
Love is sometimes crazy
When it comes to me
And my thoughts get hazy
When they are set to be
Questions asked never are
What they sometimes seem
Everything stays afar
Like a delusional dream
Don't ask me why -
Love is sometimes crazy
I can't tell you any lie
I can't tell you any lie
Love is sometimes crazy
When it comes to me
And my thoughts get hazy
When they are set to be
Questions asked never are
What they sometimes seem
Everything stays afar
Like a delusional dream
Love is sometimes crazy
But gives so much
We are sometimes crazy
And out of touch
Sometimes crazy
And out of touch
