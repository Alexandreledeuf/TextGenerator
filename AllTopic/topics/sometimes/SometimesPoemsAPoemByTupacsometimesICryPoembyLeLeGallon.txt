Sometimes i cry,
because i am on my own
The tears I cry R bitter and warm
they flow with life but take no form
I cry because my heart is torn,
and i find it difficult 2 carry on
I had an ear 2 confide in,
I would cry among my treasured friends
but who do you know that stops that long to help another carry on
the world moves fast and it would rather pass you by than 2 stop and C what makes you cry
It's painful and sad sometimes i cry and no one cares about why
