Sometimes i wish, not to be in love
don't wanna get committed, wanna fly like free dove.
Sometimes i wish, not to get marry
don't wanna be in a relationship, that i can't carry.
Sometimes i wish, not to be nice
but my heart says, that isn't wise.
Sometimes i wish, not to worry
but when situation gets tough, mind stops working in a hurry.
Sometimes i wish, not to loose control
i should practice meditation, calmness should be my goal.
Sometimes i wish, not to play with emotions
but that i do unconsciously, now i'll take more caution.
Sometimes i wish, not to feel down
people love smiling faces, not the 1 which is frown.
Sometimes i wish, not to cry
forget that damned past, at least 1 should try.
Sometimes i wish, not to work too hard
but then i change my mind, because its gonna give me later on great reward.
Sometimes i wish, not to pray
but to feel attached to the Almighty, this is the only way.
Sometimes i wish, not to weep
that's not a solution, i just need to breathe deep.
Sometimes i wish, not to play in the rain
but that I do, just to hide my tears and pain.
Sometimes i wish, not to hide my tears
but thats gonna hurt my love, which my heart fears.
Sometimes i wish, i could forget my haunting past
1 should remember good things, only sweet memories are meant to be last.
Sometimes i wish, not to study
but then nothing else will help secure a career, buddy.
Sometimes i wish, i wish him to be mine
but hes already engaged, and coveting is a crime.
Sometimes i wish, to slit my wrist with a knife
but there are other people too who love me so much, then why to end up my life.
Sometimes i wish, not to flirt
what if others got serious, then they might get hurt.
Sometimes i wish, not to eat
but i need energy to do work, else i'll get weak.
Sometimes i wish, i wish to be alone
but the very next moment, such thoughts are gone.
Sometimes i wish, i wouldn't have wished
but without wishing, even this poem couldn't have finished.
