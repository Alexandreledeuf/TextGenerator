Sometimes she wants nothing but to hide,
and sometimes she holds everything inside,
sometimes she wants to runaway,
and sometimes she thinks things will be ok,
sometimes she wishes she was some one else,
she really does she hates herslef,
sometimes she wants to disappear,
and sometimes she thinks she dose nothing but fear,
sometimes she wants to be alone,
and sometimes she dosn't want to go home,
sometimes she wishes for her life to end,
and sometimes she wishes her  life was pretend,
sometimes she thinks she has nothing to live for,
and sometimes she thinks she needs more,
sometimes she thinks her life will get better,
and sometimes she thinks it will stay bad forever,
sometimes she thinks this all she can do,
is write poems to help her through.
