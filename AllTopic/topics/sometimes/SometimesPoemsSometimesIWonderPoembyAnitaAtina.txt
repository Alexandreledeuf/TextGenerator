Sometimes when the days and nights that separate us
Stretch out, an endless void
When the distance becomes torturous
The ache, unbearably real
And the embrace of cold air
Cuts deeper than a knife
I begin to wonder how will I get through
This day, this week, this month without you
Why do our souls entwine wondrously,
When we canâ€™t meet
Why do our bodies yearn so longingly,
When the simplest touch is denied
Yes ours is a bonding of souls
In this life, our bodies far removed
But in every life, we will seek each other
Ceaselessly journeying together
On this path, with petals strewn over stones
Finding love, as the light grows.
