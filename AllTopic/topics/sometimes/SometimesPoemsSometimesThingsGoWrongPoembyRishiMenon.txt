Mr. Potato is a fat man
Who juggled his belly as he ran
He once tried to clean a fan
saying to himself 'I can, I can'.
Down came Mr. Potato with a bang
'aargh' he cried, 'ooh' he sang.
'trring' the doorbell rang
at the door, another fat man.
Mr. Potato was all sore
For the man was a big bore
who always wanted more
and would'nt just leave it at the door
Mr. Potato had a hard time that day
with nothing going his way
he fell to the floor and got to the door
only to face a big bore
