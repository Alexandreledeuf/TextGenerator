Sometimes I keep on building high walls around me
Not to keep myself away
But to see who cares enough to break them all
Who cares enough to make them fall
Sometimes I keep on constructing barriers around my heart
Not to keep my heart safe
But to see who cares enough to start
Sometimes I keep myself inside a fence
Not as a defense
But rather to see who really feels me... who has enough sense
Sometimes I keep on creating obstacles for whoever wants me close
Not to play “hard to get”
But rather to know why am I the one he chose?
Sometimes I prefer to be isolated
Not to be lonely …
But rather to see who cares enough to come close and approach me
Sometimes I prefer to be remote
Not because of fear
But rather to see who cares enough to be near
Sometimes I prefer to keep the distance
Not to act arrogant
But rather to see who cares enough to be persistent
Sometimes I do not take any initiative
Not because I’m acting so protective
But to know to whom am I really attractive
Sometimes I intend to be passive
Not to show no interest
But to see who cares enough to be impressive
Sometimes I intend to be mysterious
Not because I want to look serious
But rather to see who cares enough to be curious
Sometimes I intend to be unsocial
Not to be rude
But rather to see to whom am I really special
Sometimes I keep on wearing masks hiding my real self
Not to pretend
But rather to see who will remove them in the end
Sometimes I keep all my secrets covered
To see to whom and how it will be discovered
Sometimes I lock my door
To see who is willing to explore
Who really cares enough to know me more
Sometimes … all the times ….
And until now I haven’t found the kind of care I need
I haven’t found that someone who cares enough to succeed
