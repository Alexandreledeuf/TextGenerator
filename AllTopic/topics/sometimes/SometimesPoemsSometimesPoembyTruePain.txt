Sometimes I feel alive
sometimes I feel dead
sometimes my heart hurts
sometimes it's all in my head
Sometimes I feel lonely
sometimes I need my space
sometimes there are no problems
sometimes I've got too much to face
Sometimes things go right
sometimes things go wrong
sometimes I fit right in
sometimes I just don't belong
Sometimes I want to laugh
sometimes I want to cry
sometimes I want to live
sometimes I want to die
Sometimes I want to face life
sometimes I want to be gone from sight
sometimes I want to run
sometimes I want to fight
Sometimes I want to sing
sometimes I want to shout
sometimes I know the asnwer
sometimes I'm in doubt
Sometimes I'm happy
sometimes I'm sad
sometimes I'm scared
sometimes I'm mad
Sometimes I want to win
sometimes I want to lose
sometimes I listen to music
sometimes I watch the news
Sometimes I make decisions
sometimes I'm told what to do
sometimes I find life hard
sometimes so do you.....
