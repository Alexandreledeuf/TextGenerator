sometimes you may forget
sometimes people may forget
how nuture have a power
how the words have amagic
a magic come from the sky
in birds feather with buterflies
it have shine from long time ago
to show the ancient where to go
and now many buterflies have gone
and many birds feather the air have take
and we still dont now the truth
did the magic still or it goes
because the people have forget the magic source
the love the pureness the truth
the magic is not just a words
its love inside children hearts
its like one child wishing a wish
putting his hand on his heart and say
i wish the spring wind bring with it the lost magic source
the love the pureness the truth
