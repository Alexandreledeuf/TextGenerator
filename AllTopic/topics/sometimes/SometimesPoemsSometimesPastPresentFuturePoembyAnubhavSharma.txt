Sometimes…..I travel back to my past,
Down the memory lanes.
I find myself alone, lost in vain,
I see myself struggling, to live in this world,
With pain in my heart, that I could never tell in words.
I looked for a shoulder, which could give me support,
But no one heard me and passed on to their roads,
Than you walked in, with a wonderful smile,
This gave me strength and love for life,
The touch of your hand and your talking eyes,
Made me sure, it is you for whom my heart cries.
Sometimes…I look in to my present,
With my eyes wide open,
‘cause I never thought it would happen,
My worries have gone & I have lost my pain,
All I’ve got is luv and your smile like a Summer Rain,
The power of love and the strength of your words,
Has made me eager to live in this world,
Smile on your lips and happiness in your eyes,
This is all where my world lies.
Sometimes….I look in to the future
With dreams in my eyes,
Kissing your lips at every sunrise
I see you with me wrapped in my arms,
Giving you love and all the charms,
‘cause you are the one who has changed my life,
So I always dream you as my loving wife,
Now I always wish to forget my past,
& luv you forever until my breath last,
I pray to God may my dreams come true,
& I could always tell that “I Love You”.
