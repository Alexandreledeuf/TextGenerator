truth has a face
with many expressions
truth can hurt you in ways you can't imagine
truth can make you happy or sad
depending on the situation you had
truth can kill you or even save you
truth can help you or even break you
what if today your parents decide
to tell you
when you were a baby
you were adopted
after 18 years
your first reaction would be fallin tears
would you have want them to tell you the truth
or would rather for them to continue lying  to you............................
