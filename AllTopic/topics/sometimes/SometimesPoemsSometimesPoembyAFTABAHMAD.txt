Sometimes, you are too happy,
Sometimes, you are unlucky.
Sometimes, you wish
Sometimes, you punish
Sometimes, you pray for others,
Sometimes, others pray for you.
Sometimes, someone likes you,
Sometimes, someone hates you,
Sometimes, you are so cute,
Sometimes, you are so rude
Sometimes, you win,
Sometimes, you loose
Sometimes, you want to do,
Sometimes, you donâ€™t want to do
Sometimes, something
Sometimes, nothing
