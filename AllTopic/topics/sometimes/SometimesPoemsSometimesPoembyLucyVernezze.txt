Sometimes i want to laugh
Sometimes i want to cry
Sometimes i want to live
Sometimes i want to die
Sometimes i want to run
Sometimes i want to hide
But it's not only sometimes i want you here
I always want you here by my side
Sometimes i want to sing
Sometimes i want to shout
Sometimes i know the answer
Sometimes i'm in doubt
Sometimes i'm happy
Sometimes i'm sad
But it's not only sometimes i need you
I always need you
Sometimes i want to win
Sometimes i want to lose
Sometimes i listen to music
Sometimes i watch the news
Sometimes i make mistakes
Sometimes my heart aches
But it's not only sometimes i love you
I always love you!
