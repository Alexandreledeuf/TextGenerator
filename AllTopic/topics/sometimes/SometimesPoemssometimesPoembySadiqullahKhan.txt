Some such things I say when my mind is ablaze
When I have sweet dream or a horrifying nightmare
When an angel meets me or my body breaks with desire
When I am drunk with wine or some haunting memory
When love could have been around me to see me waiting
So long my feet grow roots like trees waiting for birds
In vegetation now I harness longer the east longer the west
Down your path my eyes tired seeing your steps and one day
I shall follow as I saw you the moment when you rose up as if
Touching feet looking deep in my eyes to see signs of autumn
Lest I may not love some one else so intensely again
That sometimes I want to forget you even if it means
Forgetting myself that has lived the torments of your love
