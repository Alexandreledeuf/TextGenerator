Sometimes, I want to cry.
Sometimes, I want to die.
Most times, I just ask why.
Why does it always happen this way?
Why is she always greater than me?
Why doesn't it get better?
Sometimes, I wish I would die.
Sometimes, I just want to cry.
I always ask myself why.
Why does she get to be free?
Why is she so much better than me?
Most of all, why does she always lie to me?
