Sometimes it is said,
We are only given what we can handle,
Is this true?
Sometimes what we are given is so overwhelming,
I can't believe it's true.
Is the pain and hurt more than we can handle?
Sometimes I wonder,
Would I leave more hurt than I feel?
That is the question,
What is the answer?
What is the release?
