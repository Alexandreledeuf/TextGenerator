I know sometimes you wonder,
Just how true are my intentions.
I know how you must ponder,
Just what are my motivations.
But these are things I thought you knew,
And thought you would never question.
The fact that I love you,
Should be known without mention.
You I have loved before I even knew what it was,
And I have drempt of you all my life.
Without a reason, or a cause,
And in every dream you was my wife.
For you I would do anything
As I have and always will
Just for the joy you bring
And I think thats a hell of a deal
Nolonger should you wonder,
Just how true are my intentions.
Nolonger should you must ponder,
Just what are my motivations.
