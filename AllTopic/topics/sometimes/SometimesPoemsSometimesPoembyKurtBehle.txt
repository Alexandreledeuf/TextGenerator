Sometimes we must get hurt in order to grow
We must fail in order to know
Sometimes our visions,
Clear only after our eyes are washed away with tears
When pain is caused by those we call peers
It is sometimes needy to stand tall
Even when we are pushily pulled to fall
To raise that unwanted we want the world of happiness
It is sometimes through hope, trust and perseverance
Perfect was not the one who came first
But that same one whom strived for the best
