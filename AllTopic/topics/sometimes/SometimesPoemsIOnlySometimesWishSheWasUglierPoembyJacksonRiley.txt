it’s one of those monumental (nigh impossible)     tasks;
one of Hercules’ labors.
tougher still than those age old questions:
what is love?
or
how much wood could a woodchuck chuck…?
I just cannot put her face into words.
I have tried.
I have a trashcan almost full with
the crumpled thoughts that I deemed unworthy
of her perusal.
'a face so perfect, God dreams
of it in His sleep.
a face that makes me (and her mirror)     the envy of the angels,
the green brush of the Earth.
how she smiles, with the corners
of her mouth spread
like the corners of the sky,
allowing an attentive observer to see
all the majesty and mystery
of
the heavens in her mirth.'
or how I find her eyes so beautiful
and moving that 'they
border on
open heart surgery.'
blah, blah, goddamn blah
I’ve literally tossed away dozens
of verses like these,
I’ve almost given up trying.
it would be so much easier just to tape
a picture of her face to a
piece of paper.
I think that would do so much more justice than anything
I could write.
but, I think she prefers the creativity. oh well,
back to the drawing board...
hey, now there’s an idea!
