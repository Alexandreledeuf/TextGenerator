Regimental Sergeant Major James Corrigan MC,
A regular Soldier in World War One,
Was Mortally wounded whilst saving another.
He got an appointment to see the King,
And the Millitary Cross for his Bravery.
My Grandpa died of his wounds.
This upright Man who I never knew,
Was my Hero as I grew up.
I heard the tales, handed down,
Of deeds of daring do
And saw his imposing figure,
In pictures all faded and torn.
I've read of the Somme and Passchendaele too
And its hard to think of him there.
Its beyond imagination to know,
The carnage and hardship he saw.
A Family man with four young Children,
And the Grandpa I never knew.
