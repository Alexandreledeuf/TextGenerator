You've watched my work in your millions
every year without fail, as
I'm on the screen so frequently;
and yet few know my face;
that's how I'd like it:
do your job, go watch the game...
there's some doubt whether I do this
just for love; or whether money
changes hands in some offshore account;
or indeed, whether I'm a conspiracy
involving the better-known;
the less known, the better, is what I say;
who wants the dread words 'product placement'
bandied around this hallowed turf..
but yes, you've guessed it:
I'm the guy you never see
who turns the labels on the Robinson's bottles
(once of barley-water fame, in the days
before 'probiotic liquid supplements')
to face the TV camera..
my service never faults.
