I've now concluded
after giving it much thought;
For all people a hero is sought.
Inspired by many,
some more so than another.
But none so much as my dear Mother.
It's taken these years
to realize her full impact,
But she's my hero and that's a fact.
She showed us love,
and taught us wrong from right,
Always keeping our future in sight.
Being a single mom,
She taught me to endure
And of my self to be sure.
She taught love of God above
and fear of Satan below.
No doubt... My mom is my hero!!!
