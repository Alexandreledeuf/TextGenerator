He is keeping us free
God's nation
Is in chaos
But there is one man that
Can save us all

He touches heaven
Just like the birds do

Strenght, love, and peace

For you and me
Kids at school
Sending Postcards to those who died overseas in the war

Keeping busy is what I need to do
And keeping busy these days seems to be the tool
I want to make the hour go fast
So I have to keep myself busy

Makes sacrifices also

Will respect our believes and not judge us by what we do
Or by what we haven't done yesterday, today, or tomorrow

And he knows that our land will liberate
A shiny city on top of the hill

It is time to look after those in need
Because charity begins at home
Superman my hero
I know that together we will get through tough times
Sometimes we just need some courage
Sometimes we need a little prayer
Sometimes we need a helping hand so we can finish our daily tasks
Superman my hero
Let the light shine in your heart, my heart, and  all the people here on Earth
Superman my hero
It is a lucky day
Because you are of flying again like a bird in the sky
Superman my hero
Miracles we will see one day
Superman my hero
Black outs
All the town is out of lights left in the dark
Traffic lights are not working
We can't cook our food
We have to eat can food for a few days
We have to survive some how
Some how we will get through this ordeal
And you are flying high above in the sky
The only thing that is shining at night is the moon
Superman my hero
I know that nobody will live forever
Superman my hero
You were meant to fly
Superman my hero
I sometimes feel powerless
Superman my hero
Once I need to get out
And put my foot out of my door
I know that fresh air  is good for me and everybody else
I have dreams and desires
Superman my hero
Once a while I just need to get away from the computer
My desk and my computer my favorite hide away
Superman my hero
Will take me to a place that I never been before
Superman I believe that we were meant to be friends
Superman my hero
I must speak now or forever hold my peace
Superman my hero
Snow, wind, and rain won't bother superman my hero
Because he always dress up for the kind of weather
He is smart and wise
Superman won't melt but he might freeze in the winter
Because the days are much colder than you ever imagine
Superman my hero
