She sits upon her sofa, just sits & stares they say,
She, s waiting for the day to come
When he walks by her way.
But she will sit forever waiting
Cause he wont be home tonight,
She must have known that fateful day
When he was shot on sight.
you see he was an officer
An officer of the law,
He didnt have a chance at all
Not even time to draw.
The weapon that should have protected him
Stayed clipped upon his belt,
No way of ever knowing that day
how the cards of fate would be dealt.
His partner went down with him
another casualty to the list,
Thier uniforms could not protect them
No badge or iron fist.
But she remembers his smiling face
As he left on that fateful morn,
Goodbye my love as he kissed her cheek
Then walked proudly out the door,
No way of ever knowing
She would hear those words no more.
The days are slow & nights are long
As she pines for the man she loves,
He, s foating on a cloud in the sky
Looking down on her from above...
