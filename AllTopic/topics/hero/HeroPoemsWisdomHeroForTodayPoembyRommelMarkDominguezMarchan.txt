You need not be
a combatant soldier
shedding blood
as dying patriot
written in history books
seen in war movies
full of medals
of valor and of vigor
you need not
be an elected politicians
with authority vested
in extending arms
livelihood program
for those who are in need
You need not be
a tycoon businessman
a publisher
a known philantrophies
in promoting foundation's interest
for the benefits of the few
You just need to be YOU
of what you are
of whoever you are
of wherever you are
and simply be a law abiding one
respect other rights
a God-fearing
a country-loving
as  hero for everyday life
