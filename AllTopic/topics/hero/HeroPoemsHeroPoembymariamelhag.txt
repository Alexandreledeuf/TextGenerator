when u r alone
with an empty dark heart
thinking of your hero
to come and save u from darkness
u will keep thinking along
if he would come or not
if he would listen to your heart
thinking and thinking and thinking
thinking with no hope
never know if he would come or no
until thinking drove u far
far far away from the world
so when u feel like hope is gone
no one hears u suffering from inside
no one know that u r about todie
and that loneliness is destroying u
just look inside u
then u finally see the truth
that a hero lies in u
a hero will take u from loneliness
come on be strong
u have waste so much
get up and enjoy your life
a happy no ending life
