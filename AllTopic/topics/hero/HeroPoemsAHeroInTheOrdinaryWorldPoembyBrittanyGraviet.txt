A hero in the ordinary world,
Washes dishes in the sink
Adventure softly whispers
'The world dies without thee'
The dishes clatter
Chipping and cracking.
Paralyzed the hero stands.
This voice, all too familiar,
Echo's his deep yearning.
'Save the world, and be a change.
You watch the world like TV.
Not liking the show,
But too lazy to reach for the remote.'
Shaken, he falls to his knees
No confidence to fuel him.
Who is he to touch lives,
And improve the world?
Adventure screams,
'Rise to thy feet ye vagabond,
flourish your glory,
before i pass thee by again.'
