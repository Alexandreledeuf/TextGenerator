You're my hero; you saved me.
I believe in the change their might be.
Came upon the frightning storm throughtout my days.
I can't believe how much I've overcome, it feels like a haze.
Horrifying moments where I feel like I'd lose all hope.
Coming this far, I didn't think I'd know how the hell to cope.
I've seen the worst of the worst, and it sickened my mind.
But look at all the people in my life; they're my ray of sunshine.
I was pushed on my own feet, and got knocked on the ground.
Now that I have you...I'm no longer in the 'last and found.'
It takes a long time to realize the good comes from the bad.
No longer look back at my life, and have the need to feel sad.
Damn, if I couldn't say if you weren't in my life, I don't know where the hell I'd be.
I got someone knocking on my door, and it's my hero that I see.
It brings a smile to my face knowing certain people haven't given up on me.
Try to be in my shoes, and see if you would've made it through.
You'd look at that girl, pass her by, and think who woulda knew.
Well now you know and know what's in my heart too.
You're my hero, and I'd never lose you.
