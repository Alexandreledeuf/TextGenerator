In the big fire at Mancini's their house and it's contents were destroyed
And the story of their bad luck it has travelled far and wide
But the story it would have been worse if human lives were lost
Though the financial damage to the family it comes at a great cost.
Clothes left to dry by an electric heater was how the fire began
And as from her burning premises Mrs Mancini ran
She shouted my baby is in there and young Bill who lives nearby
Rushed into the smoke filled bedroom to where he heard the baby cry.
He snatched the baby from her cot and with her rushed outside
And handed her to her weeping mother who in tears was overjoyed
And though the hero an unlikely one he surely saved the day
And about him Mr and Mrs Mancini only have good things to say.
Billy in his early twenties on himself he makes life hard
From his local pub for fighting for six months he has been barred
But the villian has become a hero since he risked his life to save
The life of a six months baby girl when most needed he was brave.
The one seen as a villian an unlikely hero of today
And where the faint hearted dare not venture great courage he did display
Last week he was seen as a rowdy people on him now heap praise
And the story of his bravery those who know him do amaze.
