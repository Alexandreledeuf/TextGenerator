No one sits with him
he doesnt fit in
we feel like we do when we make fun of him
cause you want to belong
Do you go along
his pain is the price paid for you to belong
its not like you hate him or want him to die
but maybe he goes home and thinks suicide
or he comes back to school with a gun at his side
and a kindness from you might  have saved his life
Heros are made when you make a choice
you could be a hero
heros do whats right
you could be a hero
you might save a life
you could be a hero
you could join the fight
for whats rights, for what right, for whats right
no one talks to her she feels so alone
shes in to much pain to survive on her own
the hurt she cant handle overflows to a knive
she writes on her arm
wants to give up her life
each day she goes on is a day thats shes brave
fighting the lie that giving up is the way
each moment of courage
her own life she saves
when she throws the pills out
a hero is made
you could be a hero
heros do whats right
you could be a hero
you might save a life
you could be hero
you could join the fight
for whats right, for whats right, for whats right
no one talks to him about how he lives
he thinks that the choices he makes are just his
doesnt know hes a leader with hte way he behaves
and others will follow the choices hes made
he lives on the edge
hes old enough to decide
his brother who wants to be him is just nine
he can do what he wants
because its his right
the choices he makes change a nine year olds life
Heros are made when you make a choice
