Jesus my Hero God & man
My Lord who’s never far
I salute You because I can
And who in truth You are
What so many consider odd
Contra what fools may say
There really is an awesome God
Through love to show The Way
The Way to love to endless bliss
Beyond this world of fears
To a life far greater than this
In a Land free of tears
He is my strength my trusted shield
My fortress and my sword
Now to the foe I’ll never yield
My Hero is The Lord
A precious God a wondrous King
A Hero born to free
Who’s praises forever I’ll sing
For saving such as me
With hands aloft with head held high
With eyes watching above
Together my Hero and I
Will show my neighbours love
Surely my Hero I salute
For giving me His hand
That I may bear my Saviour fruit
Towards His Promised Land
Perhaps these eyes may soon grow dim
I’ll trust who is my friend
Should I wonder seeing in Him?
My Hero to the end
