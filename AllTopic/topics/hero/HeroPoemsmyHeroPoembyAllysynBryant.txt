☼ This poem is in the memory of my great-grandmother who gave me nothing but good memories. If anyone was ever a hero of mine, it would’ve been her. She always had a smile and hug for me. Even in her last few weeks she always gave me the strength that I needed.
Feeling the wind brush my cheek
The warm sun settling on my skin
Where could you be?
Sometimes in the wind I hear you speak
Every time my tears fill to the brim
Can you hear me?
Every night I count the stars
Remembering everything I can about you
Are you truly watching over me?
Ever since you died it seems, you have so far
Am I everything you’d thought I’d be?
Please tell me you’re not disappointed in what you see...
I’d give anything to be by your side right now.
To see your simple smile
To feel the soft touch of your hand
And know that you love me too
In your eyes I see my own
A talent of yours I have
Though very few memories of you I have
I hold each one with pride
Just as I do for your artwork
All of which hang on my wall
Presented for all
Grandma I miss you
