I just sat there
trying to hold in
all my emotions
I didn't want to give in.
But then you showed me
bottling up emotions doesn't always work
it only leaves you feeling
like a totally worthless dork.
So I gave in to you
and told you what was going on
and together we fought this thing
that was going terribly wrong.
You gave me the strength I needed
to just carry on
without you,
my happiness would be gone.
You were my shoulder to lean on
you knew just what to say
you knew when I needed a hug
or I just needed you to pray.
so I want to thank you
for always being there
even when I myself have forgotten
what it's like to care.
Thanks for putting up
with all the things I've put you through
you are truly the greatest friend
I have ever knew.
