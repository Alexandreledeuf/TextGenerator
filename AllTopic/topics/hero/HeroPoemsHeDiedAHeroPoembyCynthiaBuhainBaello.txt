He died a hero
In a war of vague purpose
We really don't know
What it was for, I suppose.
An axis of evil?
A war on Terror-
But assessments reveal
Man's greed and error.
Was it about oil?
Who was the aggressor-
Did we make him recoil
Or were we the oppressor?
So where' s the victory
Where indeed is the end?
Death's the only reality
For the soldiers you send.
Familes now broken
Young and old lives lost,
Fathers and sons taken
Oh, at such a great cost!
'He died a hero'
Tell that to their children,
The pain of loss you don't know
As you plan a new war again.
