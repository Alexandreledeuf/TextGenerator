you have been there for me
whether i wanted you or not
you mean everything to me
and i know it might not show
but you are my only hero
you keep me
on the right path
you open doors
and you push me high
so that i can fly
as far as i can go
i know we argue
and i know we bicker
but through all and all
it ends the same
you know me more
than i know me
you show me things
i'd never see
i know that to you
i mean everything
but did you know
you are my everything
you gave me all i have
and show me what i don't
you keep me humble
and you keep me true
but the best you do
is let me know what i do
and no matter what i do
you'll still be there
you are the only one
who has stayed with me
stayed by me
and loved me
through all these things
are the reasons why
you are and always will be
my hero
