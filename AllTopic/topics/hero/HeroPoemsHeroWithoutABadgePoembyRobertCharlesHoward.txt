Richard strained his eyes
and watched his deliverer
merge into misty shadows.
Never would he know
whose strong arms had dragged him
from  twisted metal and flames
that used to be his Ford.
At  first screaming sirens
and glaring lights
the stranger had risen, smiled
and hastened up the hill.
Haloed in photo flashes
Richard shoved the mike aside.
The lady in a blazer asked again, who?
but Richard only shrugged.
Had he known he wouldnâ€™t have said.
