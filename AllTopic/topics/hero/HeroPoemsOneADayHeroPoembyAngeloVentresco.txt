The shells burst around me, my first battle has begun.
I could tell with metal flying this was not for fun.
I flopped in a hole that was tilled with rank muck,
surely I thought this would bring me luck.
Bullets came closer, soon I knew this burrow was not so hot.
I prayed, and I prayed God made them bad shots.
One tore my shoulder, I decided to flee,
crawling through the mud till a medic I could see.
A ticket to home this wound did impart.
Now I'm a vet and a hero with a purple heart.
