Our two hearts beat as one, forever glowing under the sun.
So rise once more, but shed no tears.
I wasn't afraid to give my life for someone so brave.
Do what you can, and never give in.
It will take but one second for my gift to end.
Live in the present, not in your past.
The future is approaching far to fast.
Never be afraid to do the right thing, even if it means dieing in pain. The world needs more heros to stand for our cause, freedom and happiness aren't a mirrage, their real and so is the price we pay. Losing more friends with each passing day.
Someday freedom may be free, but as of today its up to you and me to pay the price with our lives.
So stand tall in the face of terror, even just one soldier can make a difference, because no soldier is alone, our hearts beat together.
So don't be afraid my friend, I'm right there with you on the front lines, so don't be afriad I'm not far behind....
