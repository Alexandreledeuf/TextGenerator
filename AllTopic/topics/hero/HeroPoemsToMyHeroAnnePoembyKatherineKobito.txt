You and six others lived in this small place.
Yall went in hiding because of your race.
You tried to be quiet, except for one sound.
A robber heard it and spread it around.
So the Gestapo made thing go array.
One by one they took all you had away.
You lived on this Earth for sixteen short years.
No one ever saw your saddening tears.
Once a pretty girl with dreams to write books.
You went on writing, despite people's looks.
You saw life differently than others,
They tried to fly without feathers.
There is a guy who reminds me of you.
Surprise! His name is Winnie the Pooh!
I say this because he is very kind.
You and he once had the same type of mind.
I honestly wish that you were still here.
Both of us would talk all throughout the year.
Being wise way beyond your sixteen yeras,
Many things were shared, including your tears.
You are my hero, my savior, myf riend.
I wish we could talk 'till the very end.
I strongly believe that we will meet someday.
I won't lose hope-I'm living today.
