Looking back I have done much in this life
I was a child, a mother, and a wife
Yet…I am no ones hero
As a child I always tried to be helpful
A little mischievous but wasn’t much trouble
Yet…I am no ones hero
As a mother I read stories, played games, and sang songs
Baked cookies, healed wounds, and righted the wrongs
Yet…I am no ones hero
As a wife I did the laundry, cooked meals, and cleaned house
Took care of the kids, paid bills, tried to be a good spouse
Yet…I am no ones hero
I encouraged triumph, success, glory and fame
Dealt with pain, sorrow, guilt and shame
Yet…I am no ones hero
I have been looked to for security, for guidance in growth
I have loved unconditionally, for that is my oath
Yet…I am no ones hero
I have wrapped my arms around to shield from the outside
In times of turmoil, I have been right beside
Yet…I am no ones hero
I have concluded, after giving it much thought
For everyone, a hero is sought
Yet…I am no ones hero
