He was only 17 when it started
So big, but cute, and brave
We all wonder why it happened
As we sit here, digging his grave
Matthew was a soldier
Fighting for the U.S.A
He loved his country so dearly
That he gave his life away
It was 1941
And we were fighting for our rights
Against the German soldiers
That kept us up all night
There leader was named Hitler
He was a cruel and an evil man
He discriminated other races
But the Jews were his number one plan
Matt decided to join the army
So this plan would not commence
And the world once more will be peaceful
For everybody’s expense
Matt was quite good in the warzone
Dodging the bullets that flew
Over and around his body
But he knew just what to do
Matt saw a man ahead of him
And snuck up to give him a smack
But realized it was just a boy
Who was caught up in the attack
Matt gave his life to save him
Protecting the boy in the field
Taking the bullets one by one
As if he were a shield
So now we sit and cry for Matt
As he was anything but a zero
Saving a child’s life with his own
Now that makes him “A True Hero”
