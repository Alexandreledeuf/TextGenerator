would you do me a favour
and take me in your arms
take me some where out of sight
take me oh so far
away from all these people
full of hope and faith
set me down beside this lake
and sit with me a while
untill my depression fades away
untill im me again
and then
tell me that you love me
tell me that you care
for knowing you
is loving you
and without you im in dispear
so wont you be my hero
and rescue me here and now
for my other hero lost his wings
and fell upon his crown
he left me all alone
longing for some one to take me home
