Don't let me go.
Give me some strength.
Make me a hero,
because i am strong.
I am strong!
You give me strength.
Make me your hero.
I want to believe,
there is something in me.
Give me the strength,
so i can finally see.
There is something,
something strong in me.
Don't let me go.
Be my hero.
I will grow,
with strength enough,
to save you.
Make me a hero,
because i believe-
the hero in you,
will make a hero of me.
You are what i need.
The strength in myself.
I will save you; don't let go.
