I was told to draw my hero
something to fight away the bad
while kids drew weapons, superheros, hope
i drew a candle instead
An amazing ally my candle was
archnemesis it burnt
blinding enemies with light
Pointless, but I was hurt
It burned bright in my darkest hours
my little waxy friend
it brought light into unknown corners
onto doubt it would decend
Through the dark my candle led
Sheding light on all my fears
My hope once frozen now flies free
For one and all to hear
'why this hero? ' you may ask
why simply, its a fact
I'd rather face my fears you see,
then try to push them back
