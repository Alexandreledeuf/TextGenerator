I HEAR CRY'S FOR HELP
AND BOMBS EXPLODE,
BUT IM SO FAR AWAY FROM HOME,
AMERICA I STAND HERE ALONE,
FIGHTING FOR PEACE
BUT SO FAR AWAY FROM HOME,
AMERICA I STAND WITH A GUN IN MY HAND,
FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM
WITH OUT A PLAN,
AMERICA DO YOU REALLY NEED ANOTHER WAR,
IM JUST A SOLDIER THAT COULDNT TAKE NO MORE...
