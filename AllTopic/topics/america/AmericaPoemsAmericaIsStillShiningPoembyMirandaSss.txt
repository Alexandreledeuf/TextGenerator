As I looked out the window
birds soar across the sky,
O how I envy their freedom,
their realm ever so high.
I remembered America's liberty,
and how this country began,
when settlers came and started
a new life with their clan.
And now, so many many years later,
this world a dark place.
But America is still shining,
with all it has to face.
