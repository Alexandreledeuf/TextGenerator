Life is cold
Life is shady
Ima Black in america
still getting treated like a second habd citizen
Life is so unfair
My flow is never heard
Never felt
Cause i am black in america
I study keeping flowing
creating styles
cause I cant stick with one style
But LIFE IS COLD
America still wont let me be happy
until they beat me
mentally
call me names
make me feel bad for being black
I am just going off
LIfe is shady
Ima done
with this
