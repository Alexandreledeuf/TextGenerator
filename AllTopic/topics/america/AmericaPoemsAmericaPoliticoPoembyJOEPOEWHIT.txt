DEALS, DEALS, DEALS.
Small room, with twelve bathrooms.
Envelopes fill the baskets.
Mirrors with lipstick kisses.
In the small room - elbows bump.
In the office.
OCCUPIED - next bathroom.
Outside neighbors look.
Cesspool trucks arrive.
Dirt cover-up off lid.
Man preys lid open.
Next years news escapes.
CESSPOOL CLEAN and POLITICS AGAIN.
