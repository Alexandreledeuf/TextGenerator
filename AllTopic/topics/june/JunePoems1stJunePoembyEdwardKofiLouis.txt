1st June!
Heart attack! !
Admitted at the hospital;
And this was the muse of my father-in-law!
But, on the same day was,
My child's first day at school.
The phone rang and,
The news came in! !
For, my father-in-law was admitted;
But, this day and date will always be remembered!
For, it was also my child's first day at school.
