Some extraction inside
Drag to some shore
Where loneliness covers
Can't persist to happiness
Surrounded with lazy mud
It spreads to the lament shore
Darken fancies are on the way
It tilts to the shoulder side
Showers to wet all alone
Need to protest with the entire swathe
Still it can break this chunk
Yet moan inside
Feels shiver that conquers the consciousness
Can't resist with this stance
Nature is taking bathe
It chills all in this endeavor
Nature mourns inside
Its tears comes as monsoon
In this crazy night
Feels to loss in its arms
Still it's the grieves inside
I can't condolence on this concern
Even I am on the path of solitude
Still I mourn
Let our tears shrink together
June makes both of us cry
In this stiffness let's move to some other shore
Where monsoon never hits with its moan
But on that shore thirst will faint us to some side
So that needs to call him again to that shore
Though the grief comes as tears
Need to be silent and clasp this monsoon
On its pave as a dew drop tears will shed
It will pass on to its long way
So that be a part of the monsoon in June
We both mourn, to some solitude
With all the whisper lets be together……………………….
