July left desolation,
modes of transfiguration,
skin to metal parts.
Abandonned knight in armor,
he stood silently waiting,
just on his guard.
t'was valour without honour:
his hands carefully weighing
his broken heart.
August heat came and passed
stirring a renewed craving
for love left scarred.
Alpine mountain views and fast
cool crystal water, life saving,
rejoined love's shards.
But bolts and iron body cask
bitter battle flags waving
kept his mind barred.
September sent winds of Fall,
an indian summer raining,
washed th' pain away
Mist and the early birds' call
gloves and metal joints straining
wore new words to say.
Life force avoiding to stall,
Imagination painting,
what hope for love may.
October brought first relief,
a freedom most disarming,
helmet taken off.
Away the chainmail of grief,
towards a future charming
by a road still rough.
Mindfull of harmless mischief,
but a heart heeding warning
of misreading love.
Now at last November came
From coma awakened flame
burning brighter ev'ry noon.
A knight undressed without shame
asserting on a life a claim
and... awaiting June.
