Call it Author's Tradition, but since I penned
the below work in early June of 2007 & I have
reposted it each year since 2010.In mid June of
2007, it debuted in the main PH Top 500 Poems List
(before there was a Members Only List) , at No.364
Two weeks later it broke the Top 100 & remained
there until the Spring of 2010, when I decided to
revise several areas of the work & repost it fresh.
The work is a 7 time award winner, and seems to be
a fairly steadfast favorite on numerous sites, as
well as local poetry clubs in my community.
Anyway, June hath commeth again, and thus, so
has the below work been posted...AGAIN!
Hope you enjoy...FjR

JUNE...JUNE...JUNE...JUNE...
This is for June n' all the Summers it brings
Wind chasing bells of a Church steeples ring
Ole' songs of wedlock over top hat, an' lace
'fore June passes torch...to July's scarlet face
Grown trees, full jackets of multi-hue green
The last pink magnolia leaf still can be seen
There's a breeze on air that carries the scent
Of sweet honeysuckle......fresh efflorescence
Night casts its chill, yet June has its motive
A bright ardent globe... a lovers sweet votive
Moonlight romance, 'beneath a nautical breeze
Makes love in June dance like starshine on sea
FjR-MMVII
