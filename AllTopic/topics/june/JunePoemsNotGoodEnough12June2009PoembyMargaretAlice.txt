Old clothes, too small now, yet
even when I wore them it was
not good enough, never good
enough, I could never be thin
enough to meet the norm
I am too short, my shoulders
broad, I could not look good in
whatever I wore, even when
my thin clothes was a perfect
fit, it was not good enough
My old black skirt, these jeans -
still I keep them in my cupboard
amongst old files and books and
toys, the memory of how hard I
tried to meet the norm
But fatigue wonâ€¦
