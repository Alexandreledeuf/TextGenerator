Silence broken by a hushed converse
Breaking news of comma's reverse
Alien aura of tubes and stands
Silent heave swollen glands
Muffled giggle kids gleam
Gramps tries a silent beam
Hardly suit, infirm and sick
Elegant floor, ceramic slick
Fallen off a dizzying sledge
Ill at ease in a plastered leg
Distant bout of rasping cough
Chastised attendant off in a huff
Purple bruises of attempted drips
Stand out sharply from shiny clips
Divergent forms with baggy attires
Crouched nurse maneuvering wires
His quivering lips and shaking hands
How surreally fight the restraining band
Some blood be drawn for the endocrines
Whispered whoosh of support machines
A starched prong on the matron's head
Declining spinster, should have wed
