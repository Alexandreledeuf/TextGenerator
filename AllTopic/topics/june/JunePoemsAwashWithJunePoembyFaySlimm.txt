Today there is a gentleness tiding
Its way quietly into the bay,  June
Beach is strewn with visitor-white, trying
To bake brown. Cottonwool clouds will quite soon
In sea mist, try hiding the morning sun
Which is now climbing my half-shady shape
In surprising quick time.  I have begun
Distracting myself from shushing-foam wake
Behind lullaby wavelets,  replacing
Their crooning as sound from family droves
Drowns out all else. Lunch boxes are spaced
And runaway toddlers caught, then talk honed
Into quiet for munching. Shsh! !  breakers come
Once again,  whispering their own ocean fun.
