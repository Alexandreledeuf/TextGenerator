They had to bring them from the farms,
The rural soldiers far  from the storm
Those naïve lads deprived of books
Who obeyed their orders while sergeants looked;
Hayseeds who had never seen the city
Fixed bayonets without a dint of pity
And marched with fear within their eye
Not knowing that their leaders lied;
Who jumped down from their transport trucks
And formed their lines their eyes awestruck
Heads turned around at neon signs,
Colonel Sanders left them blind;
McDonalds with their great round eyes
Came to them a great surprise;
These rebels lived in paradise
With Coca Cola and pizza pie;
So they stormed the Square firing their guns,
And shot down Lincoln on the run;
Down went Washington and Jefferson
Wounded by soldeir/peasants guns;
James Madison stood up and tried to sing
But they clubbed him in the melee ring;
Their sergeant promised them Big Macs,
After they concluded their attack.
But remember the World War I song
And here the peasants sing along,
“How you gonna keep them down on the farm,
After they’ve had KFC.”
