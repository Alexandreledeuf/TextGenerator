I am so excited that once again it is June
When the sun is bright and the birds all sing in tune
Winter is finally gone so no more shoveling of the snow
Now there are hedges to trim and also grass to mow,
Just think, no more slipping or freezing or falling upon the ice
But, though now we must worry about the mosquitoes and the lice
In my youth and in my past I once loved the snow and the cold
Changes though will come, as with seasons and I am getting old,
The flowers they are awakening from their summer sleep
We now again have gardens to tend to and also yards to keep
We can now go off to the park and then off to visit the zoo
At night in the yard we could light marshmallows or have a barbecue,
It is the best month for parties and birthdays and marriages
So in June you had better be prepared to see baby carriages
And out in the yard and parks the children are eager to play
Only thing better than a June night, it is of course a June day,
Children can chase and catch lightning bugs late at night
While we all can sit around the yard with only a porch light
Winter was long and cold and finally here comes June
It again came right on time, not to late and never too soon.
