Walking down the lone street
Romancing the June rain
I met him for the first time
Call it chance or destiny
It was raining Love
First time when we kissed
We danced in the June rain
Got lost in its rhythm
I walked down the aisle
He took my hand forever
June showered her blessings
How we loved the June rain!
June is back once again
Rain and romance everywhere
Alone I sit, beside his grave
Rain pouring down my eyes
