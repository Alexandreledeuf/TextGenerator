Jasmine and Jonquils In June
Bougainvilleas and Brides Are In Bloom
Also Roses and Ribbons In Rooms
Growing Standing Ovations Of Grooms
White Satin, Silk, Chantilly Lace
Soft Symbol Veils, Flowing Over Lady’s Face
As Long Trains and Butterflies Chase
Yet, In A Vision of Elegance and Grace
Slowly, She Moves Down The Aisle
Amid Garden Rows Of Sunshine Smiles
Been Waiting For The Season Awhile
But GOD’s Blessings and Bouquets:  Always In Style
As Expectant Hush, Fills Fragrant Room
For Exchanged Vows Of Brides and Grooms
And Their New Life About To Bloom
Like Jasmine and Jonquils In June
