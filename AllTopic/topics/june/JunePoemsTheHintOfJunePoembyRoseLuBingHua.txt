The blue sky is touching me, touching
And entering in my heart with the white clouds
The garden in June
Has new buds sprouting every night
And new flowers blossoming every morn
The mighty main in June
That holds the dreams of the sky
Moves the dancing wings of foamy flowers
A ship sailing into the distance
Is softly blending the hues
Of the sky and the sea
Two coconut trees standing hand in hand
On the windfront shore
Unable to get the hint of June
