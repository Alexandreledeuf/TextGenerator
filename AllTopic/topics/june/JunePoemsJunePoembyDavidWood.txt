June burst forth with sunshine blest
Buds awakening on the stem of trees
Life awakens like a treasure chest
And butterflies flutter in the breeze.
Cygnets follow in line astern their mother,
And other ducks swim along with pride
Ducklings bobbing in the water, one behind the other
In shimmering lakes and rivers country-wide.
Weeping willows gracefully kiss the water’s edge
Their leaves blowing gently in the wind
Gaggling geese chatting as they sit on the ledge
And the old man sitting on a bench just grinned.
Dog walkers with their pets strolling on the grass,
Mum’s with babe’s in pushchairs following on behind,
Joggers running round and round trying hard to pass.
All enjoying the June sunshine away from the daily grind.
