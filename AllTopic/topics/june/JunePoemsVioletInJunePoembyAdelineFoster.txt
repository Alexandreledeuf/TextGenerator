.Violet In June
A violet caught I in repose
Upon a sunbathed bank.
Her head was bowed.  Do you suppose
It was from life she shrank?
She seemed so wilted in despair;
No tear was in her eye.
She languished in the torrid air
And seemed resigned to die.
Oh little violet, you have bloomed
When others fail the task;
Amid the hardships that have loomed
There is no more we ask.
Although a breeze of furnace heat
Has robbed you of your tear,
Your destiny is not complete,
Put off your shrinking fear.
Oh little violet, lift your eyes
Above the world, up to the sun;
Fear not, for when the daylight dies
Another dew will come.
