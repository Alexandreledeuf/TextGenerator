The early morning fresh rain
Gentle like blues
Dance away the grey dawn
Dance away the silence
The soft drizzle
Falling on my chin
Dancing into my eyes
Wetting my memories
I walk in the lightsome rain
Arms open to hug the rain
The gift you send from heaven
I forget your absence on 30 June
