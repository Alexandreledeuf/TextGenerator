and John William McGrath.
By the moon, I was enraptured.
I cried like a weeping willow,
reaching for the faraway stars
and memories beneath my pillow.
Like a whirlwind you came to me,
I weakened to words the singers croon.
Passion I felt, was more than real
Love's concerto ~ playing in June.
I dream a slightly different dream,
time goes by and I can't forget you;
my heart may show a thousand scars,
how could I believe without you?
Like a child you may turn away
obscuring the stars and sun at noon.
Tears of sorrow I could not conceal
without 'love's concerto in June'.
