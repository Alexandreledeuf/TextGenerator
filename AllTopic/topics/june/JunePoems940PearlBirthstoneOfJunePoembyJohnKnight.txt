Pain produces  perfect pearl
For pearls are not just mineral
Aphrodisiacal oysters
Provide perfect pearls - pre-packaged!
Inside their shells gently growing.
The pearl symbolises - purity
In love - in life - in liberty.
Pain produces  perfect pearl.
Natural pearls are so spontaneous
Growing slowly throughout lifetime
Seven years inside the mollusk
Gulfs of Persia - California
Jordan - Mexico and Mannar
Pearls of every size and colour
White - silver - cream - green - black and blue
Natual pearls are so spontaneous.
Birthstone pearls grace Joyful June
Fueling faithfulness and friendship
Healing heads and hearts and hearing
Bringing wearers nearer Heaven
Twinned with Zodiac sign Gemini
Channels the strength of Sister Moon
Pulsating purifying power.
Birthstone pearls grace Joyful June
Polished pearls give perfect pleasure
Pain produces perfect pearls
Natural pearls are so spontaneous
Birthstone pearls grace Joyful June.
June Joyful grace pearls Birthstone
Spontaneous so are pearls natural
Pearls perfect produces pain
Pleasure perfect give pearls polished.
This poem is dedicated to a Polished Pearl.
