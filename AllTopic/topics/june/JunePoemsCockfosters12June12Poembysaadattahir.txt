Paper neatly folded by his coat
I by the hording with my tote
Subway met every Monday morn
Ealing to Cockfosters early dawn
he's chique, cool and up ramrod
slim at the mid, shoulders broad
smiling he warily dismisses dames
in brush of days are kindled flames
been that way for some time now
now past our regular hi-s and how
lurch an stagger, in thongy calf
nervous giggle leads to a laugh
welcome squeeze in morning rush
so often now he makes me blush
oft my hair blown in his face
golden strands he likes to trace
sizes me up then blows a kiss
coyly smile and  I foresee bliss
last he eyed and asked me, Yes?
Lingering on my shape in silky dress
Before I knew I nodded my head
Hardly anything after that said
Twirled my deck at a longish bell
he's so in a dash I can easily tell
Weak and trembling at the play
I've been a waiting for this day
candle flickers at swirl of his coat
stepped by his side to cross the moat
Thrusty push with a greedy grab
Muffled unh at the eager stab
Unnh, aaanhh, aahh and grrrrs
By downy moons sighs and purrs
Languid lie in his arms a while
slowly prances in so much style
stroking hair and lingering nip
sadly I watch him dress and zip
