I banked the table very hard twice because,
I was tired of the negative systems around me;
Oh, what kind of people are these? !
12th June 2010,
And of the dirty chains around my neck;
For these people do not understand the sense of life.
Why can't they understand me for what i am made of?
Why can't they understand me for who i am?
For i need my freedom to represent my status in this land.
