International Day of Innocent Children Victims of Aggression,4 June
Furtively search for the hook.
Each side carefully must I look.
Is there a cop in my sight?
Is there a route for my flight?
Maggie just went that a way.
She didn't much, have to say.
But she seemed, distant taut.
Stuck are we in a Latino onslaught.
Three reefers all, she got the glock.
Wish I could turn back the clock.
We lost yank and tim that day.
Got em the cleavers on their way.
Now; I must, sell this grass.
Last time bro just nicked me glass.
Pounding heart, I must go.
Back here hitch the garbage stow.
Wish I could swirl and do the thwunk,
Like the kids, at high school dunk.
Pa left us months; for her sake.
Now mom is out, there at stake
Scar barged in, with her yesterday.
Slyly asked me, whether I'm gay.
Yanked me up by my scruff.
Mom when yelled, he left in a huff.
Wont have supper an no snack,
Messed the guy, tells me jack.
It's been months, the hacking cough.
Nothing at home but mamas snuff.
Li'l Johnnie plastered by a freight
What shall I do â€¦I'm only eight!
