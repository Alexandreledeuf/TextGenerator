On the hottest day in June
We both said I do!
I promise to love and cherish you
And make all your dreams come true
As long as we let God through
We will never come unglued
How could this be true?
The love I have for you
It’s as deep as the ocean blue.
It’s a circle that has no end
I promise to always be your friend
And love you till the end
Let’s dance under the moon
And kiss until noon
Because in June that’s when I declared my love for you
