The heat is mild this month of June
As I rest in shade near my home
While in silence, I heard a tune
Of a bird's song, this time of noon...
To me how sweet this lovely scene
A nature's grace, to most unseen
My feathered friends, true joy they bring
On this sunny, blithe month of spring
They seek and peck, and flap their wings
In quick glances, they eat and sing
They flew above, then play around
And hum their happy, chirping sound
It seems they knew, that I was there
As they flew near, for me to hear
I stood and gazed and hold my ground
And feel the beauty that abound
I think they call, each other's name
Maybe something about their games
Perhaps the food and other chores
Or their love mates, they can't ignore
But their life, was suddenly rouse
By a noise from a nearby house
They flew away, then out of sight
Left me enthralled, such a delight...
Alone again, and left behind
What had happened was kept in mind
As to what I felt, what I saw
In my writings, I have to show
To my beauty, worth lavish praise
Whom I love in so many ways
This poem about the birds that flew
Will be offered, again to you!
