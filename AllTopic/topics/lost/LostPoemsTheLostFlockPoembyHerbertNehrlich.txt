The Cantadora came  as it was custom,
at night to tell about the flock abandoned.
It seems the sheep had left their shepherd,
not  through a sense of  loss or even want.
They had discarded him in view of sheer neglect,
he was not fit to lead, no flock be his again.
He played, the Cantadora did recap,
with rats and other vermin of great detriment.
It seems those creatures did provide sheer praise,
the painful lack of which the woolies could not feel.
So, for the pleasure of a short lived Mozart tune
embracing treason was the logic of the day.
Down by the creek they had assembled in the light
of a full moon  and to the murmur of the water.
Not being bright but rather fluffy and of beauty,
they were unanimous at once in condemnation.
'He who can not accept the logic of a passion
to fellow creatures does forfeit his right to life',
thus all the sheep did nod and burped a silent Baaah,
and with the signal that had been sent from above
one million glow worms led the dance of sudden freedom.
