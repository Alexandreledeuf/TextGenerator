Again
I am here
among these lonely
tides of faith
roaring loudly
in my ears.
Lost voices
screaming warnings
in an antique tongue.
Sounds like trumpets
and birds.
Farther away
peace is still alone,
in the forests,
in the hills.
I ask
the world why
it mocks man.
It just smiles
sarcastically,
and whistles.
