your screaming while she sits there.
I bet you dont know that shes soaking it all in.
Shes switching parents every week or so..
to young ot know exactly whats going on.
The loud sirens repeating over and over
blue red& white lights circle around the room.
shes taken to her mom and never saw her dad
ever again.
He will never leave her heard nor mind.
She moved far away from him and started a new life.
The new dad wasnt the same as the last
and didnt stay long either.
She stresses out as so many things are happening,
in her life right now.
shes growing up and scared of it.
feels like somtimes she wants to runaway
but doesnt knwo where to runaway too.
confused and lost little girl.
