One day when you lose the one you love
The first thing you will do, is look into the sky above
Ask the lord why he had to take them away
But you will know, you will see them someday
You know that they've gone to a better place
It's way up high, even further than space
All you ask is that they're always happy
So when you meet up, it will all be lovely
When you've lost your loved one
It is hard to get over it
When you've lost your loved one
You will never get used to it
You will love them for eternity
The thing you want for them, is to live their life happily
Ask the lord to keep them by his side
And help them through, so that he is their guide
In the end it doesn't really matter
What's done is done as life begins to shatter
All we can do now is to remember them
And one day soon, we will be joined together again
When you've lost you loved one
It is hard to get over it
When you've lost your loved one
You will never get used to it
