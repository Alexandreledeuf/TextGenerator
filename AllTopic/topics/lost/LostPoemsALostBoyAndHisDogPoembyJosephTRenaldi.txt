I'm a little boy isolated from everyone,
And my family and friends need to see
That I'm missing from the neighborhood scene.
Perhaps they have forgotten all about me.
If I remain lost and here alone,
Eventually I will become weak and frail,
But my faithful collie dog has followed me,
A welcomed companion on this dusty trail.
Yet - he can't lead me home, for he
Was taught to remain with his master,
So I'm constantly rubbing my teary eyes,
And just as lost now as ever and facing disaster.
What will become of me?
