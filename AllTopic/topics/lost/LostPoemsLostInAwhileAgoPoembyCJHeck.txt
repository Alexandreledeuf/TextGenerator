Itâ€™s a warm summer night,
warmer still where she is,
lost in awhile ago.
His body spooned behind,
feathery sleep sounds in her ear,
with echoes of other sounds
from moments before.
The gentle breeze feels nice,
it cools the lusty beads
pearled across her forehead,
making skin feel like skin again.
A warm summer night,
inside her as well.
Eyes closed she smiles,
lost in awhile ago.
