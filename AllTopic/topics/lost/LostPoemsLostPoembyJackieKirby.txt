In the heart where
lier's lay
In the arms
of despair
Where all
lost souls do go
I linger there
Moon never shines
skies are black
And the sun is lost
Where misery dwells
Is where you'll find
me
Walking the path of
death valley
A lost soul
Began to be found
But i am where no
one will ever go
Even to save a very lost
soul
Lost in the world
where all
lost souls go
