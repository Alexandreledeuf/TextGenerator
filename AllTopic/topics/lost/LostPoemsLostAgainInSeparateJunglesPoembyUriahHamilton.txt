You are a beautiful woman in a room of candles,
The aroma of jasmine drifts from the terrace,
I’ll sleep with you beneath the stars
And I’ll unlatch the shoes from your feet,
There is no place upon your small body
I would ever consider too undignified to kiss.
Loneliness has been the dark lens
Coloring your perceptions,
You have left your prayers unspoken
In loveless childhood sanctuaries
Violated by the cruel
Who taught you through violence and abuse
You can only trust yourself.
It is understood, I can’t keep you,
You have no desire for a second husband,
Even the most pleasing lovers can become brutes,
But for now I will romance your mind
And learn to delicately touch your mouth,
And you will remember me later
When we are both lost again in separate jungles.
