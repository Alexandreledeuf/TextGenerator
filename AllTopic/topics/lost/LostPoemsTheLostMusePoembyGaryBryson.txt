Aweigh now your anchors
Set trim to your sails,
For the voyage of your mind
Will spin wondrous tales.
It's a journey of hope,
A destination of dreams,
And the sea that we cross
Is not what it seems.
As a child I would travel
Questioning all I would see,
Sailing on my imagination,
To any port I would please.
Then life answered questions,
Whether I wished it or not,
And my ship ceased to sail,
To the places I sought.
Now burdened with wisdom,
Of the way things should be,
I must find my way back,
My imagination to free.
Though my years may find favor,
By some means that I use,
Iâ€™ll sail back to my youth,
To find my lost muse.
