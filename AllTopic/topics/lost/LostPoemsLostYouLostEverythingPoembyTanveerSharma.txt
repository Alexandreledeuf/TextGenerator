Lost you, lost everything,
Lost the dream for being your forever,
Lost my each kind of feeling.
Lost your love, lost happiness,
Lost in loneliness, lost being mild,
Lost you, lost even how to express.
Lost you somewhere, finding here and there,
Lost my love But could not find you,
Lost you and feeling just despair.
Lost my peer - I lost my peer!
Lost you, lost everything,
Lost you, please tell! where are you dear?
