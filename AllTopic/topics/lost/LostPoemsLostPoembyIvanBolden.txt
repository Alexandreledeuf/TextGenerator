Lost
As I lay down and stare at my misshapen shadow/
What I could have had/ Lost/
What I would have had/ Lost/
What I did have/Lost/
For what purpose? For the envy of my youth? No something bigger/
Something unrealistic/ something perpetually impeccable to my being/
Something Lustful, something to live for in the minute…something I didn’t need/
No drug could take the place of love/ No formula could ignite mass theories to my emptiness/ No cure could be concocted to insure my esteem to be high/
For my mind/ Lost
My Peace/ Lost
I was Lost/
Serving under something so majestic, I am not worthy/ I a sinner walking on a path to nothing/ I stand alone in my battle for peace or so in my head/ Do not criticize me, for I am human/ But I ask forgiveness, which I hope to be entitled to/ Father help me/
For my intelligence/ Lost/
My deliverance/ Lost/
My essence/ Lost/
But in god I trust and I uphold this truth /For this is a mere stepping stone in the staircase to life/ Save me Father for I am Lost/For I am living in the moment/
