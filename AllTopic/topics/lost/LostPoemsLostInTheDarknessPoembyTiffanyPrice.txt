I'm lost in the darkness
And i can't see the light
I'm lost
I can't find any hope
All i see is the darkness in all
I just want to see the light
Can someone help me see the light?
I'm lost inside
I want to get out of the darkness
can someone help me see the light
I just want to be free to see the light
I cant seem to trust anyone
they always turn their backs on me
they have no hope for me to see the light
im lost inside
i wish someone could help me
im lost in the darkness
