When I dream the dream of paradise
I see a picture of you
And when I dream the dream of love and care
I see a picture of us two
And when I dream a dream of loneliness
I see a shadow on the wall
Looking back at me like
I'm nothing at all
But those dreams a quickly chased away
When I wake up to a sunny day
And I see your pretty face right by my side
When I dream a dream of smiling
The room is full of you
And if I dream a dream of candy land
The sweetest thing is you
And if the nightmare comes along
To say its fond goodbyes
The thought of you will stop it
before those dreams arise
Because with you sharing my bed at night
My dream will always come out right
And tomorrow will always be another day
If I dream a dream while I'm awake
That dream will be of you
If I dream a dream of wedding cakes
I'll dream a dream of you
And when I dream a dream of a loving wife
That dream will be of you
And if I dream a dream of growing old
I'll be growing old with you
And if my dream were ever to come true
I know it will be because of you
And that's the reason that I love you so.
For my gorgeous wife Melissa
