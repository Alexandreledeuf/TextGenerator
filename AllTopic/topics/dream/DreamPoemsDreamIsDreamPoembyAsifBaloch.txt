My love in dream
I see you thee, hand in hand
strolling beside the silver sea
lying on sand glowing as gold
thou art I feel kneeling by my side
I prayed for sun not to rise
and night to stay a little while
on the glowing silvery night
to me once more thy foot steps tend
following together side by side
I plead with yearn to never end
for far and wide our feet have traveled
leaving the marks on my soul
asif, for dream is dream just lie and bold
to keep the grip on hope and hold
