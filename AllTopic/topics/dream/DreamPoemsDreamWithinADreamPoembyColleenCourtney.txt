I opened the door in answer to a knock
And seeing who stood there
Gave me quite a shock
For there stood a fairy
Looking sad and forlorn
Her appearance was dirty
Disheveled and worn
Her shoes were all dusty
Her hair a tangled mess
She had knots in her ribbons
And rips in her dress
Her face was brown smudged
Her lips cracked and dry
Her wings were so tattered
She no doubt could not fly.
I welcomed her in
And we sat down for tea
This bedraggled little sprite
And still in shock me
I asked her to tell me
The tale of her plight
She looked at me sadly
Tears made her eyes bright
As she told me a story
Of swords, lords and knights.
Her beloved handsome Prince
Whom she loved with all breath
Had been wounded lay bleeding
So very near death
Hunched over his body
While shouting to the skies
He grasped her hand tightly
Gazed into her eyes
He managed to whisper
With last dying breath
Please go on without me
In life find the best.
As she finished her story
I awoke with a start
To a knock on my door
And I felt my heart stop
I snuck to the window
And gave out a peek
On the porch stood a unicorn
With an ice cream cone horn...
