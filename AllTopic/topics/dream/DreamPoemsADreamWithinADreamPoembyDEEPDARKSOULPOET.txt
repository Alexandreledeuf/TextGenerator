A dream within a dream,
So lonely in the winter still;
Wishes going into the air stream,
To never again to fulfil.
A dream within loneliness,
The moments we once had;
The day is now flowerless,
Down this entire winter pad.
A dream within a stone,
So hard and cold of all;
The feeling when we are alone,
A day or two of appal.
A dream within the past,
From nights that were before;
The thoughts that didn't last,
And therefore are no more.
A dream within a reach,
That once was staying here;
And nothing left to teach,
Or nothing gave to share.
A dream within a thought,
That we once knew of some;
But time moved on or bought,
And never again is to come.
