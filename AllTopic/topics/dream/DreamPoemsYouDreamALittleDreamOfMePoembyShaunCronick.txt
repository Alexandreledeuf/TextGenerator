You dream a little dream of me,
When you close your eyes.
A promise kept to remember,
So part of me never dies.
You dream a little dream of me,
Of when we were together.
Happy memories so resilient,
From all life's stormy weather.
You dream a little dream of me,
Now so sadly on your own.
But I return to softly whisper,
In dreams you're never alone.
