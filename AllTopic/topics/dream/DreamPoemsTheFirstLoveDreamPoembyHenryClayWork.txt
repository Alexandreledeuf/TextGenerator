Last night, mother, he told me so,
As we walked by the pebbly stream;
And I wake so happy--so wild with joy,
It seems like a fairy dream.
But his charming voice is ringing in my ear,
As a dream voice chould not be--
He's the best man, you know, in the whole wide world,
And he loves--he only love me.
Kiss me, mother, and share the joy
That has on my fortune smiled;
You have shared myu sorrows when e'er I wept,
Since I was a little child
Do you chide me now? what could your darling do,
When he pleads with bended knee?
He's the best man, you know, in the whole wide world,
And he loves--he only loves me.
Leave you, mother, it brings a pang
To this light and bounding heart;
But if he were calling, the bride would go,
Tho' you and the daughter part.
At a word from him, a beckon of his hand,
I would cross the rolling sea--
He's the best man, you know, in the whole wide world,
And he loves--he only loves me.
