A dream, A dream,
another dream.
A dream of you,
A dream of love,
A dream of you and me,
we had such chemistry,
If only you could see.
A dream we danced in the moonlight,
A dream we made love til the mornings bright light,
A dream, A dream,
Where my true feeling burst,
A dream, A dream
Makes me feel more hurt.
A dream, A dream,
of true love,
over and over,
over and over,
A dream, A dream
where we are together,
A dream, A dream,
why can't it be real,
A dream, A dream,
where really connect,
A dream, A dream
that I can't reject,
A dream, A dream,
and another dream,
Why can't it be real?
Why can't you love me?
