Last night
as I silently
slept
into my dreams
you genlty
crept.
Recalling
times when you
were there
life was breezy
without a care.
Loving you
from the time we
met
walking together
in the sunset.
Knowing your warm
tender embrace
is something time
cannot erase.
Pledging once more
my love to you
when I awoke the
dream was through.
