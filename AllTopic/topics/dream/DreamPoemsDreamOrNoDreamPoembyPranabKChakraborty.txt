stands she alone on the horizon
white her cloths blowing with mad rapture
long her airy hair playing to be off of the root
full moon strangles the surroundings to make it cry
cry not to get any another dawn
the sphinx as a look of behind chapters
the past never shows us the light
what lamped the imprisoned nymphs
night after night the whip the paws
the chiseling passion of the crown
marked their cracks their gallons of stallionic gallops
flooded the birth of enslaved curse
now glitter to revenge from ground to growth
moonlit night...
night scratches the certain rest
with the nails of horrible uncertain
flagging the smoke the dirt of dirty inhuman
possibly pissing their ancestors
locked in the volt iron-hard
to keep the way clear
to keep the root untouchable
stands she alone on the horizon
I as a sphinx  simply with blunt eyes
look beyond this dreamed night the age another
the days without death by dominating thumb
the life without fear the fear to be enslaved
shout without sound I again offer my soul
to the mighty mightier than that she stands alone
don't illuminate thy shine to shine the surroundings
gets dark its dawn with sigh and shadows of living dier
never
never
never
