It's funny how we always seem,
To be so happy in a dream,
Yet when it's time for us to wake,
We think our dreams a big mistake. It's funny how in proper life,
We seem so bent on war and strife,
If only we would try to live,
To be forgiving and to give. Then to us our life would seem,
To be the same as in our dream,
And in the morn when we awake,
We'd never make the same mistake.
