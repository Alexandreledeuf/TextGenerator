Oh fluttering pretty butterfly
At your make I gasp with daze
Let me join your dazzling dance
Laced with grace of swaggering steps
Oh sensuous playful butterfly
To your songs I simply sway
Come play me your silken flute
Treat my heart to blissful tunes
Of gentle precious butterfly
For your robe my pollen long
Let me hold you oh dainty dressed
Flake on me in golden scales
Oh beautiful princess butterfly
Come and see my petals glow
Pray attend my nectar's flow
Please my passion with probing kiss
Come please, oh butterfly
Kindly share my scented soul
Cause my life to boundless bloom
Burst with me in flame of Love
On improvement of the female sex in love relationships.
