Just yesterday morning, it was no item
between heart and dripping eyes,
to understand slowly confusion, entire world
is running by. In the darkness crossing a big city, where
single step will going ahead,
It was the sin of our frustrations, inviting
a self image with each temptation.
Don't know where to go just going true
Trying to found a place, that fill me up with peace.
Just before sunshine brightup with heat
A beautiful scenic view it was a point. that
it wasn't in my mind, will sharp noises of the water
and deep blue from the ocean, with horizon of skylight...
like sweet singing behind waves and rocks!... No,
it wasn't a rock, or a wave, it was a image
walking over those waves. with a mixture for
automatic description brighten up my mind,
an old writers must to follow.
it was short but clear and pure
every word for understanding.
like portions of small water falls,
Never before in peaceful run my mind,
when trying to clean my dripping eyes,
may the emotion, or the difference pure voice cure my peace.
Saying who you thank will be sad for you?
I know it all and stop your crying...
Will bright sunshine come out from behind
to make me blind instants and like the course
of small creak the pure voice slowly was going away.
Saying step step follow my foot prints.
