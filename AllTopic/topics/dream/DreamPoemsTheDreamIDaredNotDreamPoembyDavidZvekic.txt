I've lost the joy that used to meet your smile,
And found without its light my life now feels
That I have squandered love; It takes a while
Before faith's misconception hurts as real.
In emptiness your voice leaves sounds untouched;
The tones and memories of brighter days.
If I had only known I loved you this much,
I'd not have lost the light for darker ways.
Where secrets hide beneath a stoic voice,
The fear which bars your music soft from me,
I can not bear this hurt, but have no choice;
The dream I dared not dream means such to me.
I can not see nor hear that which I know,
But blinded thus, I dare not let love go.
