A dream is a dream.
Some dreams can come true,
and some cannot.
How you attempt to achieve that goal,
your dream, it is up to you.
A dream is a dream.
Some are based on things that have happened.
Some are what you wish to happen.
We've all heard the song, 'A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes.'
That is true.
A dream is a dream.
It can come true if you just believe.
Believe in your heart,
Believe in your soul,
Believe that you CAN achieve your goal.
And that dream WILL come true.
A dream is a dream.
