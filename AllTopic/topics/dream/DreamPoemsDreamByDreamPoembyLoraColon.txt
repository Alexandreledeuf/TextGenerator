Dream by dream, I felt his presence,
A spirit formed of love and light,
A welcomed guest in my loneliness,
Sweetly whispering in the night
Dream by dream, the truth unfolded,
I'm no longer chained to sorrow,
He slayed the dragon of regret,
His courage is mine to borrow
Dream by dream, I watched the power
Of persuasion fly like a dart,
My will was pierced, then all went numb....
Swiftly, he overtook my heart
Dream by dream, I fought surrender,
Then, he transformed my shattered world,
Bravely, I walked toward my captor,
In my hand, the white flag unfurled
Dream by dream, I was overwhelmed,
Now I still ask how can this be,
But could I live without him now....?
Impossible.... he's part of me!
