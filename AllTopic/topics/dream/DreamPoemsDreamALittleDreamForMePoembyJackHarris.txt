At night when you think through your day
Think on the things that you did say
When you think through the things that you should be
Dream this little dream for me
Dream of blue skies forever
Dream that we are a worthy endeavor
Dream this one dream so you can see
Dream this little dream for me
The world fades but I'm still here
Still living for you
I'm sitting outside beneath the sky clear
Just enjoying your view
Sleep well until morning comes
Live with the passion of a thousand suns
Tell me all the things that you should be
And dream this little dream for me
Dream of you through my eyes
Dream though it may not be much of a surprise
That while you dream enjoying the view
I'm dreaming a little dream for you.
Yes, dreaming a dream for you!
