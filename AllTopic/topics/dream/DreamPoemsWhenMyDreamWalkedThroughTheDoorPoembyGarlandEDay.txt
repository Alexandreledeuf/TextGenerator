MY DREAM WAS BORN TO ME BY DAY
SOME DREAMS ARE BORN BY NIGHT!
SHE CAME IN THE MONTH OF MAY,
THE WORLD, WAS STILL AND QUITE! NOW WITH TIME ALL THIS HAS
CHANGED,
MY DREAM SHE LAUGHS AND SMILES!
THE WONDROUS LOVE, THAT SHE
EXPANDS
COMES ONLY FROM A CHILD! IF HEAVEN CAN ONLY BE LIKE THIS,
AND DREAMS ALWAYS THIS RIGHT,
MAY GOD PRESERVE HER LOVELY SOUL
AND KEEP HER IN HIS SIGHT! SHE SINGS TO ME OF LOVE AND LIFE
AND KEEPS MY HEART FULFILLED,
MY DREAMS LIKE HERS ARE WONDERFUL
AND IN ALL OUR DREAMS WE LIVE! SOME SAY DREAMS ARE MADE BY FOOLS!
BUT THIS I DO DEPLORE
FOR GOD GAVE ME THE RAREST GEM
WHEN MY DREAM WALKED IN THE DOOR!
