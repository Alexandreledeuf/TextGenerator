Even in my wildest of dreams
I never dreamt a dream in dream
as much I lived a life as life.
A churned up dream with life is life;
thicker than dream; thinner than life.
It's life like dream half blur, half clear
and dreams solid and palpable.
Not life, rock-like reality
nor dream like fog, obscurity.
Oft dreams ornate like the Sun
donning the bright chaplet of light
and too often dreadful like the gloom
of agitating inner sin.
It's life like dream half blur, half clear
and dreams solid and palpable.
Lo life, a swim in reverie main.
In trance flapping the limbs we wade
through swirling waves of vague pictures
of fleeting world, presumed as true.
It's life like dream half blur, half clear
and dreams solid and palpable.
It's all mind-made, emotions jelled.
In solitude we feel around
a millions' scary raw din
and while amongst a myriad souls;
alone, distressed, depressed and sad.
It's life like dream half blur, half clear
and dreams solid and palpable.
Like sharks wile thoughts nibble
Like whales with yawning mouths, fears gulp
Some joys flicker, few hues shimmer
It's life like dream half blur, half clear
and dreams solid and palpable.
