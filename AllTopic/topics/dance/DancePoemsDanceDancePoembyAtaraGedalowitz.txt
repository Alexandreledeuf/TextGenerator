Dance, Dance
To the music
Dance, Dance
To the beat
Dance, Dance
To the rhythm
Stomp your feet
Dance, Dance
Even though
Your tune they don't hear
Dance, Dance
For yourself
Have no fear
Dance, Dance
If you're alive
You're doing well
Dance, Dance
And grin
So the world can tell
You know you've got
A life to live
And you're looking at the joy
This world can give
And you're dancing and laughing,
You won't be dragged down
You'd rather keep moving
Than wear a deep frown
Dance, Dance
Til it's played to the end
Dance, Dance
With a smile
My truly brave friend
