To live life as it is unfolding
under my nose
Right now
To accept myself as I really am
in the core of my being
Right now
To let go of the need to change the way I am
and love myself warts and all
Right now
To move to the rhythms of my true self
and allow myself to feel the tenderness within me
Right now
Life - I offer you my hand
Let's dance...
