Pillowy powder
Falls from the sky,
I gaze in wonder,
As the white flakes fly.
Dancing and swirling,
Through the air,
Like an aerial ballerina,
Without a care.
It lands on the leaves,
On the trees and the grass,
It is silently pretty,
But I know it wonâ€™t last.
But just for the moment,
I am taken away,
By the still quiet beauty,
That is here for the day.
