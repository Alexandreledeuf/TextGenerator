How does it feel to be?
On the floor with all eyes on you?
To move so swiftly and gracefully
To be loved
What is it like to dance?
What is it like to feel your partner?
And when do you start
Before the song ends and all youâ€™ve
Hoped for comes to a halt
And time seems to stand still
Leaving you lost
Standing alone with your partner still in motion
How does it feel to be in love?
How does it feel to cry of a broken heart?
How does it feel to know stop from start?
What is it like to dance?
I want to know
I want to feel
I want to be able to cry
I want to love
I want to move
I want to sing like you
I want to breathe
Can you give me one last chance?
Can you teach me?
Can I learn?
That is what I want
That is what I need
Help me to Dance
