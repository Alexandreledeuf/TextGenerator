...Deep in the after glow...
We swayed in the mid-night mist...
Totally enamoured in our Rainbow of love...
...Frozen in time is your kiss...
Four white roses all abloom
'Neath our summer shelter of romance...
Embrace we-'Our Together' Forever attitudes
...At home in one anothers arms...
...In the sands of Alkai Point, we dance...
