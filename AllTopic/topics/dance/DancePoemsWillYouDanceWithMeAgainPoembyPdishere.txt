Will you dance with me again?
Like we danced beneath the stars
Swaying in each others arms
To the music of a thousand guitars.
Will you dance with me again?
Like we danced the first time around
When breaths mingled and cheeks caressed
And all we heard was the heartbeat loud.
Will you dance with me again?
Like we did when we kissed
Gently first, and then with passion
When two lives got woven into one.
Will you dance with me again?
Just this one last time
For I want to feel loved
Before the end of lifetime!
