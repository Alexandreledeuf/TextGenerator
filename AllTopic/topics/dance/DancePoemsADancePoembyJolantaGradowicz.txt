Could I ask you to dance, madam?
Let’s go to dance to this music.
You mustn’t be a lonely woman
When everything is so rhythmic.
Why do you lower your eyes?
Why do you blush and tremble?
I see disbelief on your face...
Your touch is timid and gentle.
I feel your heart beat like a bell.
You speed up though music is slow.
What happened, my dear dancer?
Is there a trouble or sorrow?
I ask you, but you keep silent.
I give a tighter hug to you.
What a dance! I love this movement.
I dream it will begin anew…
