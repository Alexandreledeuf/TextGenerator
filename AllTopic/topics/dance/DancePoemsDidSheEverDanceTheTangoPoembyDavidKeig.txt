Did she ever dance the tango
On those clear and cloudless nights?
Did she ever wash the dishes?
While I was wondering what might
Time have made of our new loving
Or was it moving out of sight?
Did she ever fully love you?
Or did she merely say she did?
Did she sometimes feel too tired?
Or did she not have any kids?
Did you simply just forget me?
Why did you let my passion die?
Why did you never ever let me
Just be me so i could fly?
