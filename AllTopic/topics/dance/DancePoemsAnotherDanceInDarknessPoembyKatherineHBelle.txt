I dance alone in the shadows
My feet barely touching the ground
Walzing through the night
Lightly thinking, lightly stepping,
Hardley breathing at all.
My heart beat echos through the darkness
Singing with the beat
tarrump tarrump tarrump
My eyes glisten as i hear a voice
perhaps one that has come to save me from my lonliness.
It draws nearer by the second
yet with each passing breath it sounds farther away
Have you come to dance with me?
Or have you brought with you some light?
my home is in the darkness.
in the shadows of the night.
My tears have become my blanket
they keep me safe and warm.
the thunder, my companion
my friend the cold winter storm.
This is the world i live in.
do not judge me for what i am
Once strong and proud and hopeful.
now weak and worthless and damned.
my mirror of truth is broken
i once saw a healthy face
now cracked and scarred and starven
ugly with discrace.
so if, you, voice have come to save me
there is one thing that i must warn
the task you take is not easy:
Save my life, no matter how tattered, broken, or worn.
And you shall be my savior...
