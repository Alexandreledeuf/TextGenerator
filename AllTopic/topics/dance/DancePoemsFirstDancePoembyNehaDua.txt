Like an infant in the cradle
I rocked in his arms and penned this fable
The sweet lucid lyrics of the song
Made me forget right and wrong
He looked at me as if a rainbow in the sky
My heart skipped a beat and I felt so shy
My silky black hair acted as a veil
But his one touch and I let myself sail
He held me close and his lips touched mine
As if a thirsty soul tasted french wine
My fingers then reached his curly hair
Ang got entwined without care
I envisioned our future in those moments so pure
He is my soulmate my heart said for sure
The time should stand still was my wish
I know I was acting childish
One last embrace and that will be all
For I have to rush back before my dad's call
Mesmerized by the thought of that beautiful evening
I am writing this while his intoxicatins smell still lingering..
