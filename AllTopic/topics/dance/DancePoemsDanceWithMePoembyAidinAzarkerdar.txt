Dance with me
Beauty angel
Dance with me
In the sky...
Dance in the ocean hearts
Dance in the white minds
Dance with me, honey
Dance in the shine
Dance with me
Oh honey......
Make Light's imagine with your Dance
Dance with me
Dance with me in angel's city
Alight fire of love with your dance, honey
Dance with me, dance
Dance with me in our skins
Dance with me
Angel of beauty
Look at me....
Give your hand
Stand up...
Pull out my minds
Come to my real world
Exude your love for me
Come to this world
Dance with me
Again....
Again....
Again....
Dance with me
My heart is alive, again
When you come to my heart
Dance with me
Touch my heart
Feel my silent cry
Please Disencumber mine by my dark prison
I come with you in your paradise
Dance with me
Just for five minute, please
