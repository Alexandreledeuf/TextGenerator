We are Americans went nuke in 41
We are Americans we have the biggest gun
We now fight a war of attrition
We underestimate all our competition
We fight to maintain our hegemonious crime
We really don't care if we get there in time
We build a new weapon that kills before threat
We send in a soldier who isn't dead yet
We send in a soldier who comes back to life
We send home an alien to impregnate his wife
Visions of Terrorists soon walking our streets
Visions of Terrorists soon buying our meats
Visions of Terrorists dance in my head
Clinton and Rushdie will leave us for dead
Visions of Terrorists torture my brain
America, the collective, is going insane
