did you leave me here alone
to face this world of emptiness
while i wanted to have the dance of love with you
did you leave me here alone
to face this silence
i wanted to whisper the song of love, into your ears
while my hands were dancing on your skin
feeling the warmth of your inside
did you leave me here alone
to face this dark night alone
while i need the candle of hope, burning
with  warmth and light
in our all cold and dark nights.
