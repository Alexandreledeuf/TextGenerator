Andre fell in love with her beauty,
her royal elegant appearance.
She carried herself proud, purring
like a kitten, never boisterous or loud.
Stroking her perfect body, touching
her curves oh so gently.
He felt like the king of the ball, stood
handsome and so very tall.
Together they made their royal entrance,
totally captivating the audience.
Proud as can be,
they danced- for all to see.
Screams of elation filled the crowd,
while this royal couple took their bows.
A dance performed with perfection,
no need for criticism or direction.
An applaud broke out, a standing ovation.
Smiles laughter an awesome celebration.
The competition ended in glory,
now on with that fairy tale story.
