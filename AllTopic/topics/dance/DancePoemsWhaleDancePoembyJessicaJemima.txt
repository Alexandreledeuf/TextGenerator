You are growing old,
And your mind is aging too.
Your eyes are nearly closed,
And your moves are slowing, slowing...
But I still see the beauty
every time you show your dance,
For the ocean,
vast and blue.
I see the history of the world
in every twirl or dive,
It's there - almost gone -
fading, fading...
You seem to know the world,
All emotions and their ways,
For I see it in your dance,
For the ocean,
vast and blue.
So show it,
One more time, your dance,
For the ocean,
vast and blue.
