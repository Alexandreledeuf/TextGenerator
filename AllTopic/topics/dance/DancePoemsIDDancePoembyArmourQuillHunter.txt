I’d dance in the morning
When the world has begun
I’d dance in the moonlight
For the glory of His Son
I’d dance for Heaven, dearly on earth
Sweet of frankincense, and gifts, from birth
I’d dance for Father, Son, and even the Holy Ghost
I would love to dance for he who loves me most
I dance for the God's fishermen
Of the Gospel clan and Redemption's plan
As I’m sure, they’d all come with along me
We'd dance, together, on humanity's great sea
I’d dance on Sabbath, the Religionist to distain
I’d cure all the wounded, blind, and also the lame
I tell you: I dance in the Cross, for Victory so bright
For what's central to beauty and void envy's flight
If given a chance~ I’d even dance on the devil’s grave
For oh, I do love dancing for my Lord God and KING
I'm awesomely restored; how can I not but dance and sing
