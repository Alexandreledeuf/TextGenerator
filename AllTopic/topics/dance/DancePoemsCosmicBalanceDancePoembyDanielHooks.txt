A little ray of hope across a midnight sky
A time for all time, a light to shine
Sunrise and sunset caught in one net
For ever fighting to stay one.
A moon and a sun wanting to be as one
To set together, in a time lost in forever
Earth moon and stars fade together
A longing that fades into forever
The Alpha and Omega fading in and out
Longing to be together but always in doubt
A rainbow brings hope,
A new way to cope
We all need thathope
To stop salt filled tears from falling
Oiling the way for another day
