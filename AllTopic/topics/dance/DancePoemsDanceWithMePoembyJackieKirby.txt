Dance with me
Take my hand  pull me close
caress my body with your
warm embrace
As the music plays
press your lips upon mine
Let the music take control
dance with  passion
As our body's become
entwine
Feel the fire of desire
that burns within
Move with the music
let it slowly guide
your hands
The  music controls
are bodies
Our passions begging
to be released
Will you dance with
me
