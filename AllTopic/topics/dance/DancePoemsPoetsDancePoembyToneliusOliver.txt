Poets Dance in the heart of rhythms
Discussion spoken in the pen
Energy being tampered with in the music
Limitations rarely occur in audio-silence
Artist writes from the heart of rhythms
The Poets are dancing
Flaming hot ink drips from the pen
The paper it's a sacrificial victim
It just seems to lay still
there's no escape when the Poets Dance
Rhythmic heartbeats offset the confrontation
of clumsy feet
To tap dance on paper is a joy one must experience
to fully appreciate
Itâ€™s not for the faint-hearted
