I'll dance all night
I'll dance the pain away
I'll dance until the morning sun
Graces us with day
I'll dance until I'm numb
Until I don't feel anymore
I'll dance until I'm gone
And don't remember what I'm dancing for
I'll dance until you love me
I'll dance the rest of my life
I'll dance until you return
By the moon's gentle light
I'll dance to the music
Of my shattering heart
I'll dance until it doesn't hurt
As you tear me apart
