a dance?
a candle flame
courting
faint breeze
to and fro
to and fro
slender
shadows
the autumn leaf
twists,  twists
on  a twig
eve of separation
lovers refusing
each other go
red and brown maple
swirl in unison
beat their last drum
then let themselves
free from hangers
trail the breeze
swirl, twirl,
somersault,
jump over each other
hip hop dancers
in maddening mood
the two parter
floral crepe curtain
at the open  window
springs a solitary flight
up down,  down up,  twists
her fair and frail physique
over the field
a pink lotus in lake
gently, gently
a darting shadow
over the blazing sky
the ants on a
floating leaf
run round the edge
cross to the other edge
run round the edge
cross to the other edge
rain
under the streetlamp
swarm of insects
drunken, in their last frenzy
over elixir of light
joining the fiesta
in the streets
reflected in carlight
a million girls jump
flaunt their skirts
and well honed postures
heels over heads
