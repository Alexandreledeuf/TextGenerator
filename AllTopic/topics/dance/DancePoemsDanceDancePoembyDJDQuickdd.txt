Dance through life
Dance through time
Dance around the felings
You don't want to be mine
You are dancing through a world
You don't want to see
You are beating to a rhythm
That doesn't lift you free
From this headbang
You are performing
Slow down your pace
Recollect your mind
Stop all the things
You never wanted to find
Make peace with your song
Go ahead and dance away life
Find your true inside
And make peace with your strife
Dance around those feelings
Dance around the world
Dnace straight to your heart
And what you want to make yours.
