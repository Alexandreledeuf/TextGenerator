Dance in the moon light with,
All the stars in sight
Dance to the smiles
Dance in the shadows my love
Dance dance dance.
You may think I'm crazy
I'd dance in the moonlight
I'll dance when I want to
Please let me dance
Dance dance dance
Dancer take my hand to your,
Hand
I need to dance
Close your blue eyes,
Hold me in your arms and,
Dance dance dance.
