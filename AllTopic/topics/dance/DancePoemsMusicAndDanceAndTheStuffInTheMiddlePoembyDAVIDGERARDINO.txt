HER EYES WERE VACANT,
HER MIND BARREN, HER
FRUSTRATIONS CLOUTHED
IN BLOOD, AND HER BODY,
THROWN TO THE CURVE.
HER HANDS TREMBLE,
HER WORDS SPIT,
HER KNEES BREAK ,
AND THE DRUGS  SETTLE
IN HER BLUE  VEINS.
HER EYES  FIND A SMILE,
HER HEART FINDS  LOVE,
HER HANDS BECOME STRONG,
AND THE MOMENT OF UNCERTAINY
IS OVER, NOW ITS TIME FOR
MUSIC AND DANCE.
