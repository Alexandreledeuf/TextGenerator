Life is every where
Life
Life is a challenge
Life is a gift
Life is a chance
Life is a tragedy
Life is lonely
Life is pain
Life is full of frustration
Life is a mystery
Life is love
Life is made of hurt
Life is not a bed of roses
Life is a dance for you to dance
Life is every state of mind
What is life?
Life is a puzzle, solve it
Life is full of unexpected
Life is unexplainable
Life.
