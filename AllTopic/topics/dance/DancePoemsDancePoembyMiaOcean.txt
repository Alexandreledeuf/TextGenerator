I'm thinking hard,
But my mind should be empty.
I practice the movements,
But they come out all wrong.
When I stop,
And think,
I concentrate,
On one thing,
Dance.
And I dance.
And it's graceful,
When you think.
Be passionate
With your movements,
Listen to the song,
The beats,
the rhythyms,
And flow.
And dance.
Dance.
Smile.
Be.
