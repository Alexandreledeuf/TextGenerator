Dance, dance and dance
Dance at once
If you get chance
To celebrate joy
With intention to enjoy
Keep cool
Even if someone calls you fool
Keeps you on target
And tries to seal your fate
Loose no patience
And keep silence
With no reaction
For alter action
I am not worried
And carried
By simple accusation
That spoils good relation
Be in joyous mood
With nutritious food
That may be simple
But rich in contents for individual
