I have been touched
By Loves hand
If but one moment in time
And it's feeling
Wheat fields harvest
Can not compare in value or worth
I have felt inside
It's mystical spell
And it's dance upon a thin line so fair
If but for a moment
one small stitch of time
Two souls reached the promise of the rainbow
'Twas late August eve
Beneath full moon sky
She placed her heart in my soulful hand
To this very day
Somewhere deep within
The magic has home to which it resides
That one dreamers dance
We did share long ago
Now holds my heart never letting go
