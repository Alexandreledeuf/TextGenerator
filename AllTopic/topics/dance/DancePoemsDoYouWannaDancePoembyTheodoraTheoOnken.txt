Can you feel it?  Can you sense it?
You know the rhythm
Sinking into your Dancing Feet?
Spiriting you up on the dance floor 'of life'
Moving your entire body, to the living beat -
Can you hear those Rocking Drums Beating?
And the Electric from Jimi's guitar?
Isn't it, simply amazing -
Middle-aged-and here we are, dancin' stars?
It's in our bodies and our souls -
From our Analytical Heads to our Movin' Feet
Its the 'Music of our Lifetime'
As we pass our days, to its beat -
Perhaps, to that of a different drummer -
But that is, what makes each of us, unique -
The Music, it spirits each of our lives along -
Dance, dance, dancing, are Our Musical Feet!
Dedicated to: Nancy Grace and Tristan McManus (Dancing With The Stars-Season 13)   October 17,2011-Nancy and Tristan dance the Rumba-tune in everyone!
