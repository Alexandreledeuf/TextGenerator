Dance, dance
Thursday,28th February 2019
We always dance
and take the chance
to enjoy and satisfy
with enough of the joy
it takes place in the social gathering
and really pleasing
one's self while someone is praising
and applauding your skill
it is getting lost
in the noisy atmosphere
the loud sound and so many voices around
the real joy is never found
Your combine and dance
when inner joy wants to take a chance
your mind and heart is tuned
and you go for it to define
there is no mismatch
you are trying to catch the real pulse
that emanates from the deep inside
and without losing the time, you decide to dance
