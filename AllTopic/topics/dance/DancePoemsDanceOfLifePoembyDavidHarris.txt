Sometimes we do the rumba,
a foxtrot or a jive,
as we dance through our life,
each and every day.
We dance and we dance,
each day through.
Everyday to a different tune,
just to get us through.
In all our loving moments,
we waltz through life,
and in those complicated moments,
we will twist the whole night through.
For everything we do,
there is a dance to get us through.
For every day,
we dance our life away.
