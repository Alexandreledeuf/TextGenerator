Life is a dance which leads each one of us to the ultimate truth-Death. Here I am traveling towards my coffin, not walking but dancing. Without music, without obliged to any defined rhythm, I am inching towards it, towards my coffin. Throughout my dancing once again I am watching everything...
I am dancing without music
Dancing without definite steps
Without a rhythm and melody
Dancing towards the coffin
Daylight creeping away streets
Through the deserted ferries
Windless deserts and silence
I am dancing without music
Through colorless dreams
Through unspoken whispers
Through cemeteries
I am dancing without music
I am dancing without music
Dancing without definite steps
without a rhythm and melody
Dancing towards the coffin
Without wearing glass shoes
Without a stockings
Without feeling bleeding feet
I am dancing without music
Through burned gardens
Through spring never visited valleys
Through silence filled emptiness
I am dancing without music
I am dancing without music
Dancing without definite steps
Without a rhythm and melody
Dancing towards the coffin
