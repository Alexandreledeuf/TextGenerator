You have no dance item to do
Barring this lungi dance,
Taking full air,
The lungi dance is
But a loafer's dance
And the lungi cannot come to anyone's rescue
During the chilly winter.
The lungi dance, the lungi dance
The loafer saying and whistling it
And dancing in his go as you like style,
Dancing and whistling,
The lungi no dress is it,
But the loafer's dance.
