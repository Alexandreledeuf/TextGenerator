Nearly reached your hand this time;
I know if you’re there,
it has to be a good place.
If we’d touched,
would you have danced with me?
I’ve danced with babies on my hip,
and on stages just
out of reach of finger tips;
danced on daddy’s feet.
I’ve lost my breath,
drowning and it hurts so.
Daddy, dance me
through this darkness into luminescence.
You once saved me
from that beautiful obsidian man,
who cut me to the bone;
now save me from myself.
Crash through my palisade again
and rescue me daddy,
waltz me to freedom.
