What if tomorrow doesn’t come?
Where then shall you go?
When your life on earth is done
What happens to your soul?
You can take a gamble
And live like there’s no God
And later have to scramble
For you’ve played against the odds
Why go and do the devil’s dance
When the victory’s been won
Why leave eternity to chance
Believe in the Father’s Son
