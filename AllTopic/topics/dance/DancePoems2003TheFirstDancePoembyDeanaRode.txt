You walk up to me
those blue oceans of yours twinkling
as you take my hand
and lead me towards the crowded room...
As your arm goes around me I smile
while we begin to drift away
into our own little fantasy world
that only the two of us can occupy...
You slowly move in closer
until you're inches away from my eyes
the essence of you going through me
as you softly speak into my mind...
The music has ended now
back to reality we stand
looking at each other with a new light
wondering what will happen the next time we dance...
