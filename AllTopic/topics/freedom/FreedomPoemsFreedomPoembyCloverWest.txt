They say I have freedom
I can do what I want
They say I have freedom
To speak how I feel
But how is it freedom
To be judged for my deeds
And persecuted for speaking
Revealing my thoughts
How is it freedom
To fear being called strange
To think different thoughts
To the people you call friends
I live in my mind
I hide in my brain
I don't dare to speak out again
And I'm free to be lonely
And misunderstood
I'm free to be hated and shunned
This is the freedom
This is not freedom
It cannot be freedom
To hide from the world
