If ''The truth shall set you free''
then I have earned my wings.
I finally have faced my past...
even the dark and evil things.
I don't need your forgiveness
or your patronizing smile.
I know that I must do this...
I've known it for awhile.
A part of me was frozen
yet now began the thaw.
I'll show you I will make it...
just stand and watch in awe.
There's nothing I can't conquer
no hill that is too steep.
I'll prove I'm a survivor...
that's a promise I will keep.
If ''The truth shall set you free''
then I have earned my wings.
I finally have faced my past...
even the dark and evil things.
