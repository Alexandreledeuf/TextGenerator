For those who donâ€™t already know
This poem is not going to glow and flow
It lost its freedom years ago
Guess who dictates how the current theme goes
Arise, Arise!
Freedom is nice
Yet freedom itself comes with a price
Hence the never-ending sacrifice
After years of people giving up lives
Assisting us with out struggle to survive
To end slavery, to gain independence & to acquire autonomy
We have become the latest kind of slave, a slave of technology
Our phone conversations are listened to
Yet there is no one you can sue
Technology is watching us from cameras & satellites
Taking away our precious privacy rights
Freedom of speech, to those I outreach
Does not exist, I teach
Say the wrong things and you will be impeached
So whilst we have taken
One step forward,
We have also taken
Two steps backwards
We the slaves of new technology
Why do we embrace this new ideology?
Everything about you
Can be accessed from a central database
Is this just the beginning of a new phase?
So Arise, Arise!
Freedom is nice
But the price of freedom itself
equals the withdrawal of freedom for some
Hence the never-ending sacrifice
