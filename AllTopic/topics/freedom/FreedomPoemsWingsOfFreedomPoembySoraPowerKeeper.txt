The gift of freedom, is what one seek,
To search the lands, the seas, the skies.
Just for this gift longed by all.
The gift of Wings to fly and soar.
Worlds are combined once again.
United at last, for the gift of Freedom.
Wanting to taste this gift,
One may die, greed or even kill.
Only when voices are unanimous,
Only when worlds are united,
Only when humans no longer envy,
Only then.. Will we truly procure the Wings of Freedom.
