Poetry is about freedom.
The spirit of freedom.
The freedom of spirit.
You're free to post your poems here.
People are free to comment on them.
Or not.
You're free to air your views
on poetry rather than people, please
on the Forum
(named after a marketplace
sometimes used as
a place of public entertainment
and human slaughter)
and they're free
to disagree
simply, free -
unless, of course
you wanted something else as well?
