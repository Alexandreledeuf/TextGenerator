Soldier, Soldier, cries the child
My father is a freedom fighter
He is fighting for me and my family
He is giving his life for his home land
The sun rises and falls on him
Our enemies have fallen in numbers as dawn comes
We will be free form our enemies
We will have much to celebrate soon
We don't eat even in the hour of noon
The reason? that our hearts are with father
We will be like him when we grow up
Our land will be at the top
We will earn respect form the on lookers
And as a child, I cry for other fathers
