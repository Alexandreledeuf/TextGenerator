So many gave their lives
To keep our country free
But we rarely think about it
We treat it so carelessly
We go about our daily chores
Expecting our freedom to remain
We raise our children, go to work
Thinking life will be the same
But it doesn’t all just happen
For when you look back in history
Challenges came to the forefront
Folks fought hard for victory
It seems each generation
Has a challenge that must be met
Luckily there are special folks
Who have goals that are bravely set
So let’s all think about them
Let’s hold them in high esteem
Pray for the strong brave souls
And what freedom always brings!
