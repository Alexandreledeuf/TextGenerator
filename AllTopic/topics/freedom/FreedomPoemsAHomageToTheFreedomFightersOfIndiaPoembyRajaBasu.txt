“A Free India” - That was your only passion
Thanks to your sacrifices, today we are an independent nation.
You all were quite intelligent and hardworking
And could have easily led the life of a king
But you chose the life of danger and struggle
To liberate your motherland from the British government's shackle
You relentlessly fought against the world's greatest colonial power
And successfully helped to blossom India's independence flower.
India will always remain grateful for you peoples' supreme service
You are Mother India's golden children, whom we will always miss.
(This poem is a tribute to those lion-hearted freedom fighters of India, who got us independence from the British government in 1947) .
