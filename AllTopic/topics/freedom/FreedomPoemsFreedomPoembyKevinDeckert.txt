What is freedom? Nobody knows.
What do I think is freedom?
Freedom is,
when you can do what you like
Without ever hurting somebody
Freedom is,
when you are healthy,
Not trammelled in your bed
Freedom is,
when you are in free charge of your time
And not dominated by a watch
Freedom is,
when you can say what you think
As long as it doesn’t hurt somebody else
Freedom is,
when you can make a mistake
Without getting immediately punished for it
Freedom is,
when you can go and get milk
Whenever you want some
Freedom is,
The one thing we all want to have,
The one thing that none of us really has,
The one thing each of us defines different,
The one thing we will never have………
Freedom is…………a dream
