Freedom frees my dictionary
In my brain.. I keep the words
For every thing serious and real
The words that could change my life
In my heart.. I keep the words that
Describe me when I’m lonely,
When I’m happy or sad,
When I’m in love or broken
In my body.. I keep the words
For my health, physics and sex
In my soul.. I keep the words that
I can give to god
And thank him for every thing he gave me
Unfortunately I cant use any of those words! ?
Because in the last tow years
I have lost the word “freedom” from my dictionary
It had been captured by the dearest to me..
My freedom is locked in a big cage, full of doors
I’ve tried to free my freedom
But non of the doors was opening
I wanted to tell them release my freedom
But I just couldn’t say anything! !
I’m a prisoner because I lost my word “freedom”
I’m struggling and fighting inside of me to return my freedom
I’m in a war
Looking in silence and preying to gad! !
Those are my only weapons to send my freedom free
Every night I shed tears
But no one can hear me
I have lost my freedom
And I’m loosing me? ! ? !
