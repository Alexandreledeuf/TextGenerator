Freedom is something
we take at times for granted,
it is only when we have lost it
do we see how precious it is.
Walking down the street
feeling free as can be,
but suppose we could not do that.
How would we feel?
If our voice was choked
by oppression.
What then?
Never take for granted
the things we enjoy the most.
The freedom to live
the way we choose,
for one day in the future
we could lose it
unless we are careful
in the things we do.
