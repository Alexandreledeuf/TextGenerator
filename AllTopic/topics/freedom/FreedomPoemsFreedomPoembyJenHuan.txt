Precious like time,
Fragile like a baby.
A dream, a vision, a fantasy,
An individual's most valued possession.
Enabling yourself to soar through the horizon.
Hopes coming true,
Doors opening,
Chambers unlocking.
Feeling inside unexplainable,
Merely looking further towards forthcoming.
No past, no present,
Only the future in the beholder's hands.
Opinons differ in everyone's eye.
Easily taken away,
Earned by heart,
An everlasting promise.
