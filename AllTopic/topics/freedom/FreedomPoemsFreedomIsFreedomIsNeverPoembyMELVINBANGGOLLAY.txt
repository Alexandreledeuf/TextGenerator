FREEDOM IS..., FREEDOM IS NEVER
Melvin Banggollay
FREEDOM IS:
F-ighting for a just and noble cause
R-especting others rights and dignity
E-xchanging of views without fear
E-mpowring others to be free from tyrany.
D-oing morally rightful and lawful things
O-ffering others opportunity to live descent life
M-utual sharing  as brothers and sisters.
for FREEDOM IS NEVER
F-ighting to deprive others rights
R-aping the right and dignity of anyone
E-xploiting the ignorance and weakness of others
E-xperimenting others life for an immoral cause
D-irect assault of one's private life in disguise of freedom
O-utliving others with the power of guns and goons
M-utual sharing at the expense of the weak and many.
