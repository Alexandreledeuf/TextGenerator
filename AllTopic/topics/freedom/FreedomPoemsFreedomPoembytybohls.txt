To all our Soldiers past and present, God Bless
Glory to the American Flag, long may she wave
So many have been covered with her when they've
gone to their grave
So many of us have taken for granted that our
freedom will always be
We tend to forget those who have kept that
right for you and for me
A Soldier will stand and fight all night to
keep us from harm
While some of us sit at home and refuse to
lift an arm
Some sit around and complain all day how
wrong this war must be
While a Soldier pushes that aside to continue
to fight for you and me
Some sit around and complain about the food
their going to eat
While a Soldier works straight through
hungry and weary on his feet
While you sit around and complain about what
you have or where you live
Remember what a Soldier somewhere for you is
about to give
A Soldier stands tall and proud and ready for
the fight
We must stand strong behind them through
their hard and arduous plight
Lee Greenwood said it best 'The Flag still
stands for Freedom and they can't take that away'
So give Thanks to our Soldiers out there each
and every day
