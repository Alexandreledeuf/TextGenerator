If destiny is manifest
and fate is set in stone
then nothing that you'll ever do
is down to you alone
You can't be blamed for following
the paths down which you're led
when choices that aren't really yours
are scything through your head
It's not your job to sympathise
with every victim's plight
perception is subjective
there is no wrong or right
If your mind is built to fit
a predetermined state
it's not your fault you're overwhelmed
by other people's hate
But instead of being constrictive
destiny makes sense
Unfettered by choice, the conscience flies
free from consequence.
