There is a funeral today for the remains of a friend
Cremated remains which will be placed in an urn
And sat atop a podium for viewing and prayer
Many people will cry violently for his passing
Some will mourn quietly within themselves
But all will remember the man
For while he is but ashes now
Soon to be cast out upon the open Sea
He was however, if only for a brief time
A true American hero to me....
