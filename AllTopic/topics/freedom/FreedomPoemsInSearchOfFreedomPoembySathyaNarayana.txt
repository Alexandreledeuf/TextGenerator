In search of freedom; how strange,
waves are running away from oceans
and rays are running away from light...
I wonder,
can they ever sever from their founts?
Fastened are lives, likewise
one and all in this universe
to the unraveled hidden source.
Yet humans run in nescience
towards illusory independence.
Stop your sprint
dear straying mortals...
start searching your inner alcoves.
Not really fathoms deep to grope...
well nigh the ultimate free rein
in the wellspring; The Mighty Divine!
