Those who target and maim and kill civilians are not freedom fighters
We ought to make that one straight
They are only misguided lunatics
Who are possessed by mistrust and hate
For those they see as different to them
Who to a different god to them do pray
They sow their seeds of bad karma
And for them the price will be huge to pay.
They only hit soft and easy targets
And on such a heartless and a cowardly way
But for them what goes around will come around
That does seem fair to say.
Freedom fighters never target civilians
Well equipped armies they do not fear
And the stories of their love of Country and their bravery
Are such good stories to hear.
Those who target civilians are not freedom fighters
They only live and die in their shame
They are truly soul-less people
Unworthy of a human name.
