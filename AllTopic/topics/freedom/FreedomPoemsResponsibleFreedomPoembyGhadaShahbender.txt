Responsible Freedom? ?
In love 'Responsible freedom'
is not a choice
For Love's favorite child is Responsibility
And at her birth
Freedom is willingly aborted
We mourn the death of one
And for the life of Love's favorite child rejoice.
For Love's enslavement deafens us
With the sound of Responsibilityâ€™s voice.
Can we then speak of freedom of choice?
