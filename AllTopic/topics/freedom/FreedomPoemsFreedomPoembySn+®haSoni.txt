Freedom, that everyone craves for
Freedom of speech; deeds; religion; thoughts,
desires; dreams; love & expression
Where does actually this feedom exist?
What is the degree of this freedom?
People say each man is born with freedom and equality
But is it a practical truth?
If it is so why do we still crave for it?
Why do we see dissatisfaction and disappointments?
Freedom is not something that we need to find from somewhere
but, is something within ourselves
It doesnt exist in any legal or religious laws,
but lies within us
Is not being what people want us to be
Is what we want ourselves to be
Its not making others fulfill our dreams,
but letting others fulfill their dreams
It is one's own acceptance of being oneself
and resistance of letting others being themselves.
