I walked in to a graveyard in the dead of day
Found a marble headstone engraved with your legacy
It read this body was pretty had freedom had money
And his soul will live ooooon
I bend down to feel the earth,
The soil telling me, this body lived only half its worth
I grabbed a shovel to undo this mistake
And try to get you to awake
Stop that sleepin in that leather coffin
I know it’s nice and quiet down there
Get to digging, all the dirt up,
Take the cobwebs out of your hair
Understanding what you’re wanting,
When you say a breath of fresh air
You’re a free man in a beautiful world
Living the dream they say
You got to wake up and shake off
All the laziness that’s in your way
Hey dreamer why are you dreaming
What are you doing still sleeping
You’re a nightmare, to handle,
And this life you’re living is a scandal
Freedom in a jail, cozy in a hole,
All that drippin wax in a candle bowl
What a waste of life that’s too much to bear
Take me seriously and start to care
Freedom is a choice, choose it with your wisdom
There ain’t no comfort zone, in any living organ
Try and take a chance, your never know the outcome
It  will be hard,
But you’re going to earn freedom
