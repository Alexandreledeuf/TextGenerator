To have my own mind, without others trying to influence me.
The Freedom
To be loved, and not hurt.
The Freedom
To be accepted, and understood.

To make mistakes, and not be judged.
The Freedom
To walk with my head held high, and confidence without others trying to tear me down.
The Freedom
To be me
