The night’s darkness falling
On the city of dreams
The drizzle that has been raining
For thousands of years
On the stone inscriptions*
The angel of night had this time
Brought stories of ancient love
In midst a thought like a jump
Of the small fish or a star blinking
Will like strength we have learned
In the books and the rituals of faith
To survive when we are hurt by times
In our certitude with destiny
The destiny of self that in the physical world
Is destined to disintegrate into the unknown
Only to survive in the realm of soul
And never to return back or we shall discover
And the demon of will
Like the consciousness of being
That takes us enchained
The night’s angel
Whispered into my ears
Yet another freedom
The Freedom from will
