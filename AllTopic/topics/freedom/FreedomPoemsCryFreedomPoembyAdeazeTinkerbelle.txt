The shots fired out
The scared soldier dashed back to the fort
He had witnessed enough
He had only went to 'experience' war
And now he wanted to go home desperately
He had made friends, lifelong they were
Good people
Then came the battles
The first six didn't take any of his best friends, only people he knew
But that last one took Charlie
Charlie was his most treasured friend
But Charlie was slowly dying
A painful death
Back at the lines was Charlie
Lying helpless in a pool of blood
Surrounded by bodies
That were badly mangled as his
The new soldier had a choice
To take refuge at the fort
Where most of the 'bravest' men had escaped to
Or risk his life for his new friend
The young man died that day
'Cry Freedom, ' he declared boldly
As he rushed to the lines
The shots fired out
And the man was thrown to his friend's side on the ground
''Thanks, man, ' said the dying friend
'I knew you would come'
Those brave men died
Fighting for our country
For our families today
Cry freedom in America
For more will die
If we keep fighting
So help with the war
Cry freedom
