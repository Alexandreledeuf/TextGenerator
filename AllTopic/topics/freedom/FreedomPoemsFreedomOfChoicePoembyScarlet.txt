everyone has choices
you can choose to be good
or bad
you can choose to do the right thing
or the wrong thing
you can choose to help fight this war
or you can choose to ignore it
if you fight you can choose how
most choose weapons
but they create more problems
than they solve
for they hurt the innocent
few choose their voice
it is a wonderful choice
but only for those few who can be heard
heard and taken seriously
I choose a pen
so I may write it all
and it will be there for all whom choose to read
you see we all have choices
good or evil
love or hate
fight or ignore
right or wrong
which will you choose?
