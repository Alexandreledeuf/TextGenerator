'Dream, dream,
Keep on dreaming':
His* advice.
But I say:
Don't dream your life away..
A dream will remain a dream
Until it is broght into practice.
He dreams of factories
In the Mars
Where man is yet to reach!
Here I dream for a bowl of rice
For the children
Below the povertyline:
The longest line on earth!
Dear Kalam Sir,
If thoughts do not result in action,
It will end up in depression!
*APJ Abdul Kalam, Former President of India
