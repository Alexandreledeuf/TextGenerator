Freedom freedom freedom
Where is freedom
You are saying
Life is boredom.
My dear, Pritam
Life is not a game
Not cut not paste
And also it is not gum.
See life with freedom
Though not life itself
Is freedom, at our sweet will
Life is not go not come.
Who said life is not divine
Life is a problem who said
Who said here in life, there
Is misery poverty and violence!
Think life a torch light
And you are free to focus
Where there is nothing
Just live and think no problem.
You are free, you are free, you are free
Life is a tree, with air with water
With light, you are to live
On the earth, under the sky. Don't cry.
