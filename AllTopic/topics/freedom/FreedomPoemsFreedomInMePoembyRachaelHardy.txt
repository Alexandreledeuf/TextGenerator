Heart filled with love
Heart filled with fire
To have her one dream
Her inner most desire
She will never tell
She will never say a word
Because the bird of freedom soars in his eyes
She must not disturb
A life unlived
A dream untold
This man she cannot get
This man she cannot hold
But still she has hope
Hope of living her life
And hope of dreaming her dreams
Hope that one day he may see
Freedom
The same she sees in him
She cannot love another
Nor hold another's hand
She prays every night he'll just understand
She feels freedom around his presence
That feeling she gets no where else
His dreams are reality
His life is being lived
Because he has freedom as it is
