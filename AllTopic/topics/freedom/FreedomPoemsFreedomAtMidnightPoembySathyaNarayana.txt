At the stroke of twelve; midnight
we earned freedom! Well! We did it!
We waited, waited, waited, waited
we waited not just six hours for dawn,
but alas for sixty five years in vain.
Very few dredged the darkness to fetch the light;
but many spewed venoms to stretch the night.
Terrorists, factionists and fanatics
gained the reins of the reign in dark
to run their rackets free of any fetters
while remained our leaders, indolent,
insolent, corrupt and inept with no intent
to direct and correct the groping multitude.
Commoners too care not the dark nor feel any remorse
even if the long waited day-break
starts with a longest solar eclipse.
They preferred smug slumber and lives with no bother
and forgot sans doubt with perfidious conceit
the blood and sweat shed by our great founding fathers.
Fumbling are we still in gloom to untie many a Gordian knot!
Oh God! Save my country from all these Stygian fogs!
