In A Desert, The  Wind  Arrived A Teasel.
The Teasel  Asked  Him
How  Can  I  Become  Free  Like  You?
The Wind  Laughed  In  His  Sleeve  And  Told
First, Try  To  Bear  The  Pain Of Homelessness And Vagrancy
Then Be Patient And  Wait.
The Freedom Comes To You Himself.
Then He Mumbled  In His Heart
Alas!
Cage Of Every One Is As Big As His Dream Of Freedom!
