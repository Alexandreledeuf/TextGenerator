When does one become many?
When love seeks to own,
and actions take on a purpose.
When does one become one?
It never does, one was never many.
When does the unlimited become finite?
It never does but we dream it.
It isnâ€™t the universe that we dream
but all that is in it.
When will we be truly free?
When we find the prison key
and decide to use it.
