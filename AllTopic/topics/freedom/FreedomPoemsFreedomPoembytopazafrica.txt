country as free as a bird
born in a free world
you would think i have it all
you would think im also free
well let me tell you something
im always questioning who i am
never realizing what im worth
others make me feel so small
threatening to take my sense of being away
combing away my truest self away
i see so many faces, all smiling
smiling faces looking at me
all i have  is this one question
will i ever be free in my own body?
will i ever find my truest self
i need to escape this normality
the survival, of my soul depends on it
im falling to the shadow of normality
this society has killed my individuality
