Today the little bird
is let out of his cage.
He doesn't know
if his wings will still fly,
but at least he can enjoy
walking around
the garden-like world.
The bird dreams;
in his cage,
even his dreams
often have bars,
but as he strolls in the garden,
he feels like a peacock,
suns and stars and luminous eyes
blazing from his own tail.
Whether he flies or not
is almost immaterial,
for his world today
is cool and green,
and that is Heaven.
Where else
would he wish to soar?
