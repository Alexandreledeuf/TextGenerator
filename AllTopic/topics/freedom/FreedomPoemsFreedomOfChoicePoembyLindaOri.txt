God's love is unconditional
It is not bound by strings,
He does not give the bird a voice
Then tell it what to sing;
He does not give us wings to fly
Then tell  us where to go,
He does not give each man a mind
Then tell him what to know;
Life is an experience -
Each man will choose his way,
And if he makes wrong choices
They'll come back to him one day,
But still he learns the lesson,
Be it difficult or not -
God does not tell us what to learn
Nor dictate how it's taught.
