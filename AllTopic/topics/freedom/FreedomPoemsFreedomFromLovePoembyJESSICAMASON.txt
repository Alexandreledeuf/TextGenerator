Freedom to love again.
Freedom to try love again without thinking
about the past.
Freedom to think without worry.
Freedom to dance  to my
new found love..
Freedom to feel the touch of another man
heart and soul.
Freedom to forget the past.
Freedom to cry without any sorrow......
Freedom to walk with out trials and
trubulations...
Freedom to be along and think
in peace.
Freedom to start a new life feel with love
again...
Thank you for freedom......................
