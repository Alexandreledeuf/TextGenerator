Dreamlands of passion call my name,
From the abyss of the darkness,
And I am here struggling in vain,
Searching the path to success.
Winds of love blow towards me,
Whispers of wisdom and knowledge I hear,
The thought of the pain seems like wants to be
The excuse for everything I fear.
I see chains and locks, ropes and nails,
On the boat the brings news from far,
I listen to screams, and shouts, and details,
While I am wishing a star.
I can feel the heart going mad,
And the breath is accelerating gently,
The thoughts that from the start I had,
Crash into me incidentally.
Delirious thinking and feelings,
That run like crazy,
Beating,
Pulsing,
Whacking,
Whipping,
My judgement, senses and dealings,
While my conscious goes hazy.
But suddenly I search for the light,
The combat must cease, I fight the underkingdom,
I oppose, agitate and defend what is right,
I finally find itâ€¦ all this for my freedom.
