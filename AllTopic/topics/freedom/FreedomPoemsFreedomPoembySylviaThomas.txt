Whilst your soul dances,
beneath the cradle of heaven's stars,
the tall grass gently caresses
your ankles.
With the hand,
that is bound by no chains,
And the eyes,
that see the heavens the skies behold.
Neither the cloud,
that flows in a rhythmic pattern
Nor the bird
who is set off course by another.
You are the wind,
You are the one,
to control your own fate,
because you are free.
