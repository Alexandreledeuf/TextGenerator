There's a free in freedom
a dominate in dom
dominate implies ownership
terminates empowerment
Dominion demands tribute
like the tributaries of Berg Lake
Mount Robson its watershed
the waters of rejuvenation
Flora & Fauna its tribute
When you have realized your identity
when you take a stand in every understanding
when you cease as a convict in control
Control illusory
the only real control
self-control
After you butt the troll from each bridge in your journey
when your voice is clear strong
call to the heavens
From the spire in inspire
your Knight will deliver
the delicate flowers spirea
You will know the free in freedom
and free to speak
to be listened
Only then will you be free
to see the Phoebes
Kingfishers
And cast away
free from fear
freedom to dream
