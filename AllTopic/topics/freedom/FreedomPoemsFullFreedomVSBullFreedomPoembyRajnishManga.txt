We enjoy full freedom in India
Even the cows and bulls are free
Jaipur was witness to this theory
Recently a tourist from Argentina
Was attacked and mauled by a bull
in a highly busy street of Jaipur
The tourist succumbed to injuries
The biggest irony was that the man
Had come to Jaipur with lady love
To celebrate his Birthday in style.
