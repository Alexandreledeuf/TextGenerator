Thinking can never be free
Stems from the conditioning deep in our minds
Cultural...Social...Literary tree
Glued to us putting us in a bind
We think our thoughrs are free
But are they really? ?
Any books or poems for that matter that we read
Or the ideals or the principles that we lead
Are all rooted to the mind thats been fed
All the learning from the life we have led
Every thought being a result from that
Whats the newness, may I ask? ?
Just be aware of what that signifies
Observe what it means, do not fight
Try and slowly uncondition the mind
Without a conflict that can make you blind
Make the mind still, remove all thoughts
Remove the veil of words, maybe it blots? ?
A flash of understanding, a rapidity of insight
When mind is not burdened by its own noise
It is the memory that really interevenes
Challenge and Response in between
A chattering mind cannot understand
Truth... which is like a thief creeping into a still  night.
