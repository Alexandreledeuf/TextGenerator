Travel light a friend once said to me,
'Yeah right' i thought with my big screen TV,
but over the years I've changed my view,
now i know there are very few things truly essential to you.
Each move I disposed of more sentimental tat,
it became easier as i realised, don't need this, don't need that.
Then one summer's day i was forced from my home,
loads more had to go, into storage went some,
Now i live in a hostel with limited bits,
eight months on, the stored, do i need it?
With every possession also comes responsibility,
burglars shot to save a five pound DVD,
so now I'm working my way to cut off the slack,
i want to end up with just a rucksack,
then I'll have freedom, true freedom to roam,
wherever i lay, that'll be my home.
