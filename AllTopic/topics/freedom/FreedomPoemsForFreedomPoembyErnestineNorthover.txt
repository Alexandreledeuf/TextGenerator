Remember them, for they were once like you,
With hopes, emotions, days of grey and blue.
Accepting combat, trying to win through,
To fight again, for freedom.
Remember them, for they were young and green,
With so much life ahead, as yet unseen.
They knew not what they faced, but all were keen,
To fight again, for freedom.
Remember them, each fought to give us peace,
That each fierce conflict in this world, would cease.
And then when all was done, they’d find release,
From fighting foes, for freedom.
Remember them, who’ve joined the heroes roll,
Their names inscribed now, on a parchment scroll.
Thousands did not survive the war’s hellhole,
To fight again, for freedom.
Remember them.
