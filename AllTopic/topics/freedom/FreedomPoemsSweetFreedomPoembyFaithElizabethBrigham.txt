i could write volumes
on all i've seen of
desolation and despair
but for what good purpose
no, i can not spread doom
for the world is full
of such loneliness and gloom
when compassion should rule
my lengthy prayers go up above
for peace for one and all
my fellowmen, choose freedom
ah, sweet freedoms steadfast call
