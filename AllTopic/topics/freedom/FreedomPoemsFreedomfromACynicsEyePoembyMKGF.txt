At last! I breathe...
Freedom...
No more questions in my mind,
no more doubt nor fear.
My mind, my soul
My spirit breaks away
Beyond this wounded,
Earthy land.
And so I pause,
I soar in feathery weight
Happiness within reach
From the sapphire cottony sky.
Elated I sigh...
Freedom...Ah...Freedom
I hold you in my heart
As I await once more...
To see life
Through a cynic's eye.
