Wrapped inside a little womb,
Struggling to be free,
The butterfly soon left its cage.
Nevermore a worm to be.
Born anew to be a sign
Of beauty, grace and life.
A light among a gloomy world
And hope in the midst of strife.
Oh, butterfly, with wings outspread,
Glistening in the light.
Show us how to fly with ease
As you begin your freedom flight.
