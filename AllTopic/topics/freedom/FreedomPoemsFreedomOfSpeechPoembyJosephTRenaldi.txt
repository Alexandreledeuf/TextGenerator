Please, don't chastise or stone me,
Or force me into a fiery grave.
Instead, let me present my views freely
To those who are steadfast and brave.
Let my words echo across the land,
A right that we value and hold so dear.
May my words be uttered without reprimand,
Speaking emphatically free from fear.
