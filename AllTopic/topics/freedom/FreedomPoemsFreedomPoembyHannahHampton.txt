They told me that I have all the freedom I could ask for
They told me that I had it because I was born in the United States
They told me that I was lucky
Because I have the freedom to think for myself
Because I have the freedom to criticize the government
Because I have the freedom to dress how I want
And say what I want
And be what I want
And these are all freedoms I take advantage of
And because I have the freedom to learn, I took advantage of that
And I learned that there were others without freedom
And not just in other countries
Just because they’re of another race
Just because they’re of another sexual preference
Just because they’re of another religion
Those are the reasons they don’t get freedom
Those are the people who don’t get freedom
Those people are the mistakes
Because freedom should be for everybody
