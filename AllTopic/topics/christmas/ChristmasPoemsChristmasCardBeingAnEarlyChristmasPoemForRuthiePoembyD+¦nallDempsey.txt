I don't
(normally)
do this
you understand
but I am
staring at her
chest
in particular
where her ample breasts
meet in a more than ample
cleavage.
Did not this
awesome architecture
of female flesh this
confluence of mammaries
just go
...tweet?
Yes...there
it is
for all to see
in a daring low-cut top
a robin redbreast
in her cleavage
making all who see it
...smile.
A tiny broken
robin
with an injured wing
(poor thing)
nestling between
her breasts
(well it is
Christmas after all) .
She feeds it
every hour
with a tiny
dropper
as it nestles
snuggily.
'Peep...peep! '
it pipes up
every so
often.
Come Christmas
she gives it
the gift
of its
freedom
nothing but
blue skies
all day long
it returns
to its
human
as if it were
a living
Christmas  card.
