Merry Christmas to you all,
no matter where the snow shall fall.
With or without, Christmas is here.
Enjoy this precious time of year.
God gave Mary a joyous gift.
Allowing her to conceive his son.
Dec.25, Mary gave birth.
Sweet Baby Jesus joins us on earth.
Glory be to God in Heaven,
Thankyou for this precious gift
A gift of life, love and light
Jesus shall remain always in sight.
