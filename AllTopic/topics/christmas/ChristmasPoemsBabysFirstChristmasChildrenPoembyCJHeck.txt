So, this is Christmas morning...
everyone is here.
I don't really understand it
cause it isn't very clear,
but Mom and Dad are happy,
there's pretty ribbons everywhere,
lots of things that they call presents
and even paper I can tear.
They keep showing me this new stuff,
balls and books and even soxes...
they don't seem to know how fun it is
just playing with these boxes.
