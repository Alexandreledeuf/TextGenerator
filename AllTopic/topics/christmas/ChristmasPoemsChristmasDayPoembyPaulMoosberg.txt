Christmas is so merry, at this special time of year
Christmas is extraordinary, as long as you are here
Inside my heart I’ll jump and dance, excited just to see
The sparkling beauty in your glance, upon this Christmas eve
We’ll cuddle tight and wait the night, for Santa Clause to come
We’ll hope and dream a million dreams, and wake up with the sun
Then Christmas I will look at you, and that’s when I will say
“Oh darling all my dreams came true, with you on Christmas day! ”
So hang the holly and the lights, let out your Christmas cheer
And stack the presents to new heights, it comes but once a year
