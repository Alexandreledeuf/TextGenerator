In presence of the multitude,
I have shown barring no gift,
For what hath I worth thy child......
In glance of many gifts bestowen,
Frankensence, Muir, Silver, Gold,
For I posses nothing worth Lord......
In tater clothes I bow Mother Mary,
And confess the birth of virgin son,
Yet words fall short of glory be.....
As thy man Joseph smiles upon,
Watching o'er thy babe Jesus,
I surrender in humilitance unto my lack.....
In moment chance hold thy hand,
of the child that taketh my place,
For this tiny babe shall wash me clean.....
In this childs eyes my saving grace,
In his fathers hand thy mercy proclaims......
