It seems the theme this yuletide.
As thought up by some folks,
Is "Let's keep Christ in Christmas",
Say, are they making jokes?
I've always thought from childhood,
That this was his birth date,
Or so that's why my mother said,
Our folks did celebrate,
Am I all wrong? Is this all new?
Or are we coming back,
From down the road where we turned off,
And maybe lost some track.
I find that if I close my mind,
To worldly pleasures here,
That Christ IS Christmas all the time,
Each day throughout each year.
But if by chance you've lost your way,
Then wash the slate up clean,
Give credit to those folks who thought,
Of this years, "Yuletide theme."
But when all of this is over,
And yuletide lights go out,
Let's NOT keep CHRIST in Christmas,
But each day from here on out.
