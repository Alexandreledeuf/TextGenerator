Sitting in front of the fire, Auntie Flo's reciting a story,
it's one about her first Christmas as a newly wed,
the same one she broadcasts every year,
but no one is listening.
Uncle Fred, 'out to the world' snores rhythmically

is sending flashes of colour across the room,
straight into Grandpa's eyes,
making him feel even more bilious
after having consumed too many chocolates.

and every other day, come to that,
probably yet another scarf for what she believes is

in front of his sleepy eyes.
Susan is gazing at the TV screen, .

singing every song, word for word,
at the top of her voice.

'Your problem is, you never can refuse a second helping', said Grandma, 'so it's your own fault'.
Mother grins and asks,
'Would anybody like another mince pie? '
