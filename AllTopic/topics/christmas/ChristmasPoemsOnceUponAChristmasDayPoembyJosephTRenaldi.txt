Once upon a Christmas Day,
A sense of cheer and  joy  were in the air,
Music aroused the spirit everywhere.
Decorated trees and colorful lights strung,
On the mantel the children's stockings hung.
Once upon a Christmas Day,
Greetings were extended with smiling faces,
Fond thoughts that my memory embraces,
Many wrapped gifts in full array,
An annual tradition on this Holy Day.
Once upon a Christmas Day,
Carolers were singing from afar,
While in the heaven appeared a bright star.
This Christmas came on a snowy day
Leaving memories that will forever stay.
