The greatest gift of God to man is Christ!
The love for creature man that God displayed;
Born in a manger of Virgin Mary,
By the power of the Holy Spirit,
To redeem mankind from the wages of sin,
So that, ev’n sinners can go to Heaven.
The birth of baby Jesus is Christmas.
Heaven and earth rejoiced when he arrived;
“He would be named Emmanuel! ” said God.
And grow up wise with knowledge of scriptures;
And suffer for no sin or faults of his;
But die by crucifixion at young age,
Resurrect on third day, defeating death!
His sacred blood-shed wipes out any sin;
All sins confessed are forgiven by God;
He would die for all mankind, present, past;
He brought both peace and joy to life on earth;
He was a Prophet, miracle-worker;
He was God’s son in whom God was well pleased!
Christmas gave new hope to human beings;
God could forgive all mortal sins of man;
Hell was for devils; not for every man;
All those who repented would see God’s face;
Jesus was Messiah, God’s begotten son;
God so loved the world, He gave his one son!
Christmas is in giving;
Christmas is in sharing;
Christmas is in loving;
Christmas is in caring;
Christmas is in humbling;
Christmas is in suffering
For others, for Christ’s sake!
Christmas is in repenting;
Christmas is in praying;
Christmas is in forgiving;
Christmas is in keeping
Our souls sinless and pure;
Christmas is in bringing
Back Christ into our hearts!
