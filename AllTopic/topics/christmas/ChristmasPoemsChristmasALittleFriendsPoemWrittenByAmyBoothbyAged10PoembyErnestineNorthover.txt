Are you...........
ready for Christmas? , to decorate the tree,
The sparkling baubles that shine with glee,
The shops are filled with Christmas galore,
But the people are shouting, 'We want more',
Each and every leaf, is covered in snow,
We're still waiting for Santa's Ho! Ho! Ho! ,
The Christmas lights, light up the street,
Presents to open, people to greet,
Look what's under the tall green tree,
Are these presents all for me?
