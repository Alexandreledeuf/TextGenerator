Christmas day arrives.
Stockings are first to be explored.
Oranges, apples and sweets.
On their beds adorn.
Mum and Dad are awoke,
at some early hour.
By childrenâ€™s faces,
filled with laughter and smile.
Saying their presents,
they wish to explore.
Coloured paper and ribbons,
scattered here and there across the floor.
Boys with cars and girls with dolls,
seem to be everywhere.
As for the toys in the shops,
that were wanted, but not bought.
In the excitement of it all.
They are not missed
and very soon forgot.
