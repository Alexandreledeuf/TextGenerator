All you little children gather round.
Let’s sing beautiful Christmas songs.
Take your bells and chime away,
we celebrate Christmas here today.
Now raise your hands if you know the reason,
we celebrate this colorful season.
One, two, three, four, oh my, more and more.
You all deserve a great big score.
Now, let’s think a moment of our sweet Jesus.
Why we know he’ll never leave us.
He gave his life upon the cross,
we would live,  not become lost.
Today we celebrate his precious birth,
while he watches over us here on earth.
Clap your hands rejoice for all to see.
Keep Jesus in your hearts infin-ite-ly.
