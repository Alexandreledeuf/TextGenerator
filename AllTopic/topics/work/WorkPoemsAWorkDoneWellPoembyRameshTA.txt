They are happy because I have moved with them;
They remember that today I spoke to them.
The day has ended as the working time is over;
Surely someone will say a kind word of me there.
The day is going fast whether we know or not;
But we have done the best we can in time tight.
Certainly everyone is rejoicing over what is done;
And everyoneâ€™s confidence is restored as it is fun.
By involving all I have utilised the day without waste;
I leave behind my mark in all the things I did fast.
So, I can have a cool sleep even in the summer night
With hope and confidence I have created in the work!
