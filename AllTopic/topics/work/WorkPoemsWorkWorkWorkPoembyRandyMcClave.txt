You work, work, work
To provide for, and to live,
Then you buy, buy, buy
You constantly spend and you give.
Then you work, work, work
Just to pay your bills and your debt,
You work, work, work
Until you are tired and you sweat.
You work to go on a vacation
For relaxation and some thrills,
But, then when you return home
You have more debt and even more bills.
So, you work, work, work
To find more stuff to buy,
Then you work, work, work
Until the day that you die.
Living, it is just a cycle
Life it is just a quest
You work, spend and buy
Then at the end of the day or life, you rest.
