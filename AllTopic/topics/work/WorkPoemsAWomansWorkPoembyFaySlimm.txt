They say it's never done.
A woman's work.
When, and how can we find fun
Without shirking
All the things there are to do?
Here's a clue.
Try to be aware of
Gifts, hiding in
Every dull and mundane job.
When cooking - stop -
Think, 'how does this vegetable FEEL'
When peeling.
Then, arranging flowers.
Spare only one
Moment, to see the powerful
Colours, deeply
Glowing with exciting sheen.
Once we've seen
Their beauty shining there
Just for us,
We can start to look elsewhere
For other joys.
The whiteness gleaming, through
Folds of blowing clothes
Drying on a line.
When changing beds
Bouncing up and down is fine
For mothers too!
And when cleaning floors why
Not start to jive,
Put music on and show
That we're alive.
Like all other things we flow
With vibrant life.
Try this satisfying way.
Start today.
