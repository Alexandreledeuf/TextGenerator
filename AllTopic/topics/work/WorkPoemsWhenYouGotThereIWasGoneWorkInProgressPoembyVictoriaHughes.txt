I know that today I ran from you
I didn't mean to hurt,
I couldn't stay a minute longer
I'd waited by the church.
You said be there by nine
When you got there I was gone,
I thought it would be fine
It was nearly ten past one.
I waited there for hours
The rain was pouring down
Looking at the spires
Birds flying and swooping round.
You can't hold on forever
I have walked out the door
I wondered briefly why and realised
I didn't want to see you anymore.
