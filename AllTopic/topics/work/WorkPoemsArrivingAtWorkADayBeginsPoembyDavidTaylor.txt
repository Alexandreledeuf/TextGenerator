A glint of early morning sun reflected
in the shiny waxed panels of the parked cars
with blinding rays of light from the mirrored wings
bursting star like on my eyes from a focal intensity
only a pale shadow of the low lying god in my heaven
which hung with unknown colour in a pale blue sky.
The sole of my shoe crunched a gravel chipping
as it pressed into the dry surface of the tarmac drive
making a small mark in memory of my passing
A butterfly with painted wings left its soft repose
and dipped and rose upon the gentle blowing wind
the same air that filled my body with breath and life.
