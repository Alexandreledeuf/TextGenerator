Sorcerer's Work
If all  the morning     became  identical,
If all the night- long continue in a twilight...
If the soul is punished to live without dream,
Tell me,  it's not called death of the poet...
If  azure- eyes do not see to sky more, more
Inevitably, I will soon forget of   heavens colour ...
Don't begin a white song  my white swan, while
I know, it's  sorcerer's  work, he has not died   -live...
