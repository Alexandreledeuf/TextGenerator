1. Fun
Why would the sum of Tolylfluanid and
Dimethylaminosulfotoluidide
be expressed as
Tolylfluanid?
Clearly Tolylfluanid is a he and
Dimethylaminosulfotoluidide
is a she, so the kid should
proudly carry the name
Of the father’s clan…
But I’m glad to report
the sum of Benomyl
and Carbendazim
is expressed as
Carbendazim
making the gender
question quite
superfluous
If you know
what I mean…
2. Last But Not Least – Prince Diazinon
I know, these impressive names could be
used in a Terry-Pratchett-type novel about
the Discworld - ancient families in the
Ramtops and learned scholars at Magic
University, though Mustrum Ridcully
will always be my favourite, the library
baboon definitely a firm second, as
well as Lord Vetinirari
Let’s look at the fabulous list of families:
Mr and Mrs Azoxystrobin, young Chlorfenapyr,
The beautiful Isabella Folpet, Madame Iprodione,
she’d have to be the seamstresses’ leader, I think
Professor Lambda-Cyhalothrin,
That mad Hatter of a guy called Maleic Hydrazide,
Little Metalaxyl, and last but not least –
Prince Diazinon…
