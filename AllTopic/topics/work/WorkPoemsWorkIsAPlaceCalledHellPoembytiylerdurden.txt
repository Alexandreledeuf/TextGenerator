Hell is a place I have to go
Hell is a place that I truly know
I have to go to hell
I have to hear that ringing bell
I must scrape through the day
Just need to make some bread every day
Hell is a place that makes me pay
Hell is a place I hate
Hell is a meal that leaves a bitter taste
Hell is a place I wake up and go to
Is Hell a place you call work, too?
