just love your work
and tell you what
the work does
it all for you
just sit there
do not even think
or lift a finger
your work hands
everything to you
in finished forms
perfectly perfect
love your work
and everything is done
without noticing
the existence of time
love your work
the table comes to you
all set and all you have
to do is simply sit,
eat and relax and
wait
kewl.
