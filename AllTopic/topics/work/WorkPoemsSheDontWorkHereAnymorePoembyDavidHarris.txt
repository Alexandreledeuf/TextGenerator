She sat alone
in front of her computer screen
hoping for some images to appear
and awaken her lost dream.
She wrote of love
in words so sweet and pure.
Words of love she hoped one day
would be spoken back to her.
Everyday she grew more lonely
as time kept marching on;
hoping all the time to hear
springs sweet love song.
Whether she ever heard it
is very hard to tell
as she no longer works here.
Some say she found her love
and eloped with him,
others said she just died
of a lonely broken heart.
Whichever way the story went
it is hard to tell
as she donâ€™t work here anymore.
