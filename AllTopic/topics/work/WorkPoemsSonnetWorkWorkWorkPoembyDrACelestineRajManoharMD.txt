Forget the past, however bitter be;
Tomorrow is yet in your very hands;
But labor hard towards a goal truly;
Your dreams could turn true from some distant lands.
Let patience stay with you till very last;
Small bickering should not upset your mood;
All cannot take the lane that is too fast;
There isn't the time to waste or even brood.
And when a hill in life is climbed by you;
The glory, satisfaction are so great;
Nevertheless, you must condescend too;
And try in life to do a greater feat.
All days are same; we must keep working more;
Work harder till life takes you to the fore.
