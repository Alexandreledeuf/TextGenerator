We struggle with it
under many names;
we all feel the tension
and the tug-
how can I as a child
learn equality
and go to work
where
equality dies
in  the bureaucracy-
a lonely stepchild?
Where in the hierarchical
schema chart
does Freedom live?
Where is Justice
in the work place Meeting With Staff?
No, we all have bosses
and contemplate each day
where do my child-learned
ideals fit?
I will tell you;
in the Water Cooler Gossip Group.
There is where Justice is done
complaints are vented,
where equality before the H2O
is talked about and dispensed.
How can
what I learned democracy is
be banned from my work space?
How can Fairness and Morality
be slaughtered like the lamb
in the hierarchy?
We have revolutions not because of the
ruling class
but because of the anger exposed
and felt
before the Water-Cooler Deity;
where
shock and awe
exist,
where plots and plans
from the latest
gossip-tidbit
to strategic strategies shared
among participants
who like soldiers and couriers
make sure to dispense
each bon mot and redemption
far and wide
among those who did not make
the morning
Water-Cooler Meet.
True community
exists here,
at Water Cooler Church
complete
with the Paper Water Cooler
Communion Cup.
Drink up-
Salvation is Coming.
Truths long concealed
bubble up
Truthiness is clear like
Evian
and we drink it down
and steeled,
return
to that cubicle space
for another run
at Demon Boss
who hovers
overhead;
the Lufiwaulfe;
verbal bombs and
critiques
in the bomb bay
ready for release.
Excuse me
I need a drink.
Can't stand too much more
of this Faux-Equality.
