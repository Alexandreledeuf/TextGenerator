Work
What should be just play
Was turned into toil for pay.
The curse of sin they say.
Why do they lead us astray?
Worker's Pledge
Salt and sweat will rule my day.
I will work for my daily pay.
Myself will I never betray.
Limits
Humans will never know an earthly end
Ever striving higher, deeper, faster then
Never ready to breath a last amen.
Youth
Life - what about it do you care for most?
Living - isnâ€™t that your only boast?
What later then will be your toast?
