Though I have only experimented with it briefly, I am a believer in ‘Lucid Dreaming’
Do you ever create poetry in your dreams? Or do you perhaps compose music?
Do you solve complex problems? Or have you ever thought up a joke?
I have done all of the above and of course many more entertaining things.
Dreams amaze and delight me. Do you remember your dreams?
I often do and one morning woke up with this small poem in complete form.
It is not the greatest poem, but I was amazed nonetheless. I will share it now below:
Dream Work
As sure as I am shooting
As far as I can tell
All things of worth
Persist in dreams
So make them serve you well.
