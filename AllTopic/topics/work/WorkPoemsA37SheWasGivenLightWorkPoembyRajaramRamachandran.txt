“The whole world is watching
How Sister Bernarde is living?
Had she died, on us the blame
Surely would’ve come.”
“So, we should keep her
Healthy and safe here,
Let her duty be light
Till she feels alright.”
As a rebirth for her it was,
The Bishop said like this.
Taken out from the kitchen,
Light work, she was given.
She spent her time,
In a spacious room,
On works like paintings,
And colorful drawings.
She did them in perfection
It was a center of attraction
To every visiting personality
Who praised her simplicity.
One day a visitor came,
Not announcing his name,
With his long grey hair
To meet and wish her.
It took sometime for her,
To recognize her father.
She saw him very old
He came there too tired.
To see him, she was glad.
She gave him nice food.
About brothers and sister
To hear, she was eager.
He told, “We miss you
But always remember you.
By His grace, I’ve a mill
That is running well.”
“Your sister Marie has
One boy and two girls
And your two brothers
Are my two helpers.”
“To you, my dear child,
So far, I haven’t been good
Nor given you proper food
From the days of childhood.”
“No Papa, I never felt
In my life like that.
I was always happy.
Now also, I’m happy.”
“I’m sorry for mother
Who loved me forever.
Always I remember her.
Now badly, I miss her.”
Their feelings went thus.
They talked for hours.
When he left the place
Tears filled her eyes.
