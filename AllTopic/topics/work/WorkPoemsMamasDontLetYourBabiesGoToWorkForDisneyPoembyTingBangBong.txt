Mamas don't let your babies grow up and work for Disney,
Don't let 'em wear mouse ears,
Or sing a pop song,
Don't let 'em wear belly shirts,
The whole thing is wrong.
Mamas don't let your babies grow up to work for Disney.
They''ll end up on drugs
And be managed by thugs
Cos here's where it's at,
Mickey mouse is really a rat..
