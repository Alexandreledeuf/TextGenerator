Work in the morning
Work at noon
Work in the afternoon
and work in the night.
Work, work, work
One wakes up thinking of work
eating and planning for work
sleeping and dreaming of work.
Work, work, work
work with passion
work with obsession
derive joy from work
or take  work as the sole end.
Work, work, work
Give work the chance
never to rule over your life.
Work is only a tiny part
of who you are.
