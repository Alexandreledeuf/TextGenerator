I am
A piece of paper, creased with folds;
The jumping brother of all the tadpoles.
Move me around or croak a song
I'll be sure to sing along!
Even though I don't have a voice,
But you're a child, so imagine the noise.
But not the poison, the green's just ink!
My limbs just proof I did not sink!
Unlike my brothers, oh so many of them
Bound to the scavenger earth with their black stem.
They couldn't manage to change from being change;
Metal's a terrible material to make tadpoles, anyway.
