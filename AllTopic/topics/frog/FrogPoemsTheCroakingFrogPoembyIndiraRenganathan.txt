When the rain pattered
The frog started croaking
The monkey on the tree warned
'Danger is in ambush'
She wouldn't listen too
'I know, my father
Keeps saying this'
She said
The monkey didn't ask
'Is your father too a monkey? '
The frog got finished
In one hiss
So was she finished
In one miss
