A frog walked into a bank for a loan
She was making some improvements at home
She was sent to Miss Patty Stack
The loan officer who sat in back
When Patty saw her collateral, she groaned
Is this the only collateral you own?
Let me get the bank manager on the phone
Sir, I've a frog out here, wants a loan
Um, for collateral she has a small gnome?
Why, that's a nic nac Patty Stack, give that frog a loan!
