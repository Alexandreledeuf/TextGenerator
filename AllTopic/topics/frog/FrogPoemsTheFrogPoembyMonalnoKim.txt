I heard a strange noise, very loud
Between the high shinning grass
Which looked like a very tall crowd
In a green ceremonial mass
I searched for the noisy source
And to my surprise I found
A frog dancing with incredible force
On the hard, soiled ground
The emerald frog shook his left leg
Spun around and waved his arms
Hopped twice like he was about to beg
And croaked loud, causing many alarms
He shook his hip 'round and 'round
And sang out loud with all his might
Between the grass, on the ground
The frog danced, Oh what a sight!
