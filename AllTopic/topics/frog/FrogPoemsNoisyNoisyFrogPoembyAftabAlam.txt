If a common noun is made adjective
And noun is faithful and very active
Faithful friend since time immemorial,
Loved by us yet his loyalty is a slang
If a common noun is made adjective
Who is furious formidable n reactive,
If we give the tag name, we are happy,
Not faithful, not loyal, blood rocky
We love the cruelty and this is fact,
What we want and what's the act,
"Dog of God and not God of Dog"
Our thought is wrapped with fog
Ah! We are the holy born, the rogue,
On faith's well a noisy -noisy  frog
