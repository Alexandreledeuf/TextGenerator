There once was a handsome green frog
who  resided  inside an old log.
He had cut two small vents
in the log for defense
but the stork  used, as cover, the fog.
And he swallowed the frog in the buff
though just one frog was never enough
for a frog in a log
who can't see in the fog
daily life can be utterly tough.
