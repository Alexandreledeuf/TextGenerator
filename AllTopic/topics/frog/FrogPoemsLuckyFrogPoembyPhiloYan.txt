A tiny Costa Rica frog
was caught in heavy rains
He hops around to get away
Pitter patter water pains
He chanced upon a tender leaf
that stood on single stalk
enough to shade the little frog.
he waits for water stop
And when it did the little frog
Jumps off the saviour stalk
he croaks aloud and naturally
escapes in grateful hop
