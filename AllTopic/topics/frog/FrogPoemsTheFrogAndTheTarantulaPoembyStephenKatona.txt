A frog and a tarantula is an unusual pair,
In a hole up a tree they're happy to share.
The dotted humming frog has poisonous skin,
So he's safe from succumbing to his hairy kin.
He protects the spider's clutch of eggs,
From ants attracted to her insect dregs.
There's mutual benefit from this clever deal,
For ants are this frog's favorite meal.
The spider scares the snakes away,
To look elsewhere for their prey.
It's a wonder how this sister and brother,
Have learnt to help one another.
If you want to see these splendid two,
Take a trip to the jungle in South East Peru.
