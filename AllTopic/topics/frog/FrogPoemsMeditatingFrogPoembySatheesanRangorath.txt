He was meditating on a lotus,
Eyes half closed breathing slowly.
Dawn was falling through a sieve,
as silver grainy mist from heaven.
Moon takes a last dip in the pond,
wading through the dark waters.
He walks away to eastern horizon,
wearing his wet cloths still dripping.
Eyes closed water lilies looks aloof.
Pre-dawn mysteries yet to arrive,
flakes of moon light still afloat,
as Beauty of daybreak had to unfold soon.
Slowly sun signalled the curtain raiser.
Golden brooms swept darkness away.
Symphony of life started performing.
Opera house reverberated with music of life.
He woke up suddenly from his trance.
His throat moved in folds of waves.
Lotuses started to open eyes one by one.
There he leaped, splashed his tongue, came out,
With a dragon fly struggling in his mouth.
Again went into depth of silent contemplation!
Tongue tied! Camouflaged!
