By day, this well-contented frog
Has made his home on yonder log,
Nipping at flies with rounded ribbit-
Grumble
But I've heard tales of the frog by night,
Lit up in limey lunar light,
As dizzy glow worms dip and tight-
Rope tumble:
In glittering waistcoat and top hat,
Beside a leotarded bat,
The frog becomes an acrobat-
Ic wonder!
This have I heard, but is it true?
The frog will not tell me or you -
Just sits and croaks and leaves us two
To ponder.
