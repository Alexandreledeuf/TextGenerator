Frogs are green
like chlorophyll
their eyes bulge out at you
they can be mean
and further still
can  fit inside a shoe.
They have a land
all to their own
it ain't a small one, no
so shake their hand
'cause they are prone
to see you as a foe.
They eat their legs
and also snails
and drink the Beaujolais
a frog who begs
is one who fails
be warned, that's all I say.
A stereotype
is something which
applies to definition
of all the hype
it's really Kitsch
and now I'm going fishing.
