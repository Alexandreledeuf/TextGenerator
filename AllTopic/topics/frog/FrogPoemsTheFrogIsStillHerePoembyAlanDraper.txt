Jacques the chef ordered it
The livestock removed bit by bit
My pond has been drained
Nothing now remains
He wanted frogs legs for his menu
No green creatures are now in situe
Most of my pals limbs have been eaten
But I've escaped - unbeaten
Give me time to recouperate
I might even find a new mate
I'll be back
Just don't tell Jacques!
