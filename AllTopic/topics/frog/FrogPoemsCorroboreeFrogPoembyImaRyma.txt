The Corroboree frog I be,
A hopping the land down under.
Black with yellow splotches on me.
As hubby, I am a wonder.
I know that I need build a nest,
Using my hind limbs to sculpt moss,
Make proposals that I sing best.
Ladies to my threshold do cross,
All laying eggs I fertilize.
The gals take off but I do stay,
And wait for the waters to rise,
Till hatching tadpoles come my way.
Ah, the memories that I've had
Living as a stay at home dad.
