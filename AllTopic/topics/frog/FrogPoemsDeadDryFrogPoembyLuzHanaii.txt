Dry out frog, so dead so flat
been run-over more than trice
no more flesh, no more stench
just a flattened crispy shape
I picked you up and took you home
saw the beauty in your bones
put you on a pedestal
sprayed you with a golden glow
Many wonder, many claimed that
I made you out of lead
others think I work in steel
but my secret won't reveal
