However much learned we are,
However big our possessions are,
However large the kingdom we rule,
However wide our popularity is,
However deep our knowledge is,
However widespread our domain is,
We need to accept that
We are no better than a frog
In a well
Some are in a big well
Some are in a small well
A well, regardless of its size
Will never become an ocean
Ocean is the ultimate truth
Well is the ground reality
A frog in the well cannot
Fathom over an ocean
But, we, with our sixth sense
Can comprehend what ocean can be
And need to be on a continous effort
To understand the ocean
And reach there,
The ultimate reality
