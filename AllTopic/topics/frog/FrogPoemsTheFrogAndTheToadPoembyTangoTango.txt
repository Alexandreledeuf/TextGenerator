Come, said the frog to the toad,
let us hop down to the pond,
at the end of the road.
Jump on to a giant lily leaf,
and watch the fish,
as they swim underneath.
Dine on the succulent dragon flies,
see the  the world,
as it drifts by.
Then at the end of the day,
we can gaze at the stars,
watch the moon,
as it passes mars.
Come said the frog to the toad.
