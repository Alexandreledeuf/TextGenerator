Man prides himself with intelligence
Human Logic rationalizing,
But what he really lacks is Patience
When the moment requires some waiting.
Today a frog in blithe expertise,
Had some short lessons laid in action.
He showed that trying should never cease,
For Success comes with Repetition.
He jumped on a green stalk, missing twice.
Then returned to make good his attempt.
Jumped once more, no defeat in his eyes -
He missed, but held the end of the hemp.
He climbed one leg up, still holding on,
His frog face tinged the trace of a smile,
His other arm grasped at victory won -
Sat on top of the leaf in a while!
