You reminded me
of the first ever FROG
I dissected
gave it enough chloroform
and put it to sleep
then saweach and every part within
once I sealed it up
I cried out to miss
ma'am it is not awaking
then she told me
now it never will
I felt devastated
and
at time I came to know
NOGod does exist
We are ourselves destroyers
only
what God can life now give
none could answer me
Can any spiritualist ye
but don't relay theory
we have already heard it
