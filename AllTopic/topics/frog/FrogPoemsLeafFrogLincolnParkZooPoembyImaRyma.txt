I am called a leaf frog - guess why!
Yep - cuz I blend in like a leaf,
Waiting for a snack to come by,
To my delight, to the snack's grief.
An insect is such snack I seek,
And when it does roam close enough,
I give it my flicked tongue technique,
Stick on the snack and down I stuff
It to my tummy to digest.
I cannot chew, so blink my eyes
So that my eyeballs are so pressed
To help push down my insect prize.
So why so happy do I be?
Becuz I do eat what bugs me.
