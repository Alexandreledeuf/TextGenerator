The great, green gob
was opened wide
and a wriggling worm
was fed inside.
The boy said, 'Mum,
the frog he comes
and sees me every day,
but a grass snake lurks
and slyly works
his slithers by the way'.
Then the snake, like lightning,
makes a strike.
The boy he quickly starts
and jaws around
the great, green gob
are gently eased apart.
Now frog and snake
their freedom take
from the boy
with a pounding heart.
