Days I yearn to kiss your luscious lips
Delicious lips tasting like a reddish apple
as I bite upon your watery tongue
Dark hair conceals your beautiful face
your beauty resembles that of Aphrodite
Praying you'll love this fool
Times trapped in my dusky hell
You're there to show me the light
Days your sweet words inspires me
Compassionate words bringing hope to
to this foolish sinner
Darken days, the Moon
shines on your caressive skin
my stiff hands stuck upon your
bosom while you remain silent
in the lace bed
