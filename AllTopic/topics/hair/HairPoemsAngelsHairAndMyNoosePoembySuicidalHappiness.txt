Angels fall and babies cry
Walking around mindlessly insane and I don't know why
My vision of ecstasy is only you
That happiness that I've never had leaves me hopeless to
One week has passed and I feel pathetic, frustrated and somewhat insane
You made me think I could be beautiful what a horrible lie something so vein
My veins have been cut and my bruises made
But at your feet I fall and down goes my cascade
I promise to you that I will get better
But believe me when I say it's only getting harder
The thorn in my tights and my suicidal dream
Life is never what it seems
I love you there is no use in lying
It hurts so much I suffocate in the tears I told you I'm not crying
I mourn the death if my Anorexic  - Love but more for the death if my dearest friend depression
I hate you and don't want you, how dare you replace it and become my obsession
It comes to this, I no longer want you anymore
I need you and there is nothing I can do at all
You are the purest and dirtiest drug and I need to feed it
I tell myself I'm not an addict it's just a habit
But my tongues saliva is again full of these little black lies
But what can I say, darkness my most faithful disguise
From Satins heart to gods light
I miss you and I love you so I bid you a dearest night
