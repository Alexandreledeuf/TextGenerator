Go ahead and buy yourself a drink
A few more, and the pain will ease.
As you kneel before the porcelain God
Ask yourself if it was worth it.
Was the momentary peace of mind
Worth the six hour hangover?
And besides, it was only a figment of your imagination
You were never really at peaces with yourself.
It was just a drunken blur
The pain was always there.
