(I have always dreamed to be bald since I was younger. But there are some things which are stopping me. But this I promise myself, I will really fulfil it sometime soon. Hope you enjoy my short poem.)
I want to cut my hair
Till I only see the skin
I want to walk and run
And feel my hair is gone
It's been a long time dream
To do it But it seems
My guts are getting low
To be so bald, you know
But this I told myself
Before my time is done
I'll cut my hair away
And find out what I say
For I think it is nice
To feel what is not there
I want to be HANDSOME
Even for  short a time.
