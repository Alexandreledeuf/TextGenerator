Chords of the most beautiful song,
With my eyes, tracing the prominent
Vein that followed the course of his arm,
Round and round, over and once again,
In love, from the whole painting
To the small details and the even smaller
Obscure signature like a mark or a sign
Kept hidden, yet so visible.
For eyes that do not see what I see,
Will never find the perfect melody
I played mentally, while running
Long fingers and polished fingernails
Through those strings of His hair.
The moment, only created by a sudden
Bolt of beauty that dear Helios
Wished upon and for, for me
Can I only say thank you?
Such rays, soon soon they were gone;
I have but to ask the gods one more
Precious treasure by their hands given.
Eros, beloved Eros, have my heart as long
As his becomes mine, for I do not mind
just so I could render my song.
A tune for my heart; Oh let his youth
Be forever, diamond like;
So will my devotion to Thee.
For a whole minute, the whole world
All the unbelievable forces that we dare
Deny the existence of, re-arranged time
And life to, in a whole minute,
Replace my widowing heart and soul
And create the most sublime
Single measurement of time
That will forever and ever, eternally
Remind me of how gold and bold
Love can be.
