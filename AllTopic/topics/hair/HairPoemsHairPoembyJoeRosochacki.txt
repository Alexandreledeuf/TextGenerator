My hair like Jesus wore it
Hallelujah I adore it
Hallelujah Mary loved her son
Why don't my mother love me?
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Flow it, show it
Long as God can grow it
My hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Flow it, show it
Long as God can grow it
My hair
(From the Musical 'Hair')
Hair today, gone tomorrow,
A lock of John Lennon’s hair was sold at auction.
But what I would ask is how sure it is John’s at all?
Did CSI London extract the DNA?
Did the dream team of OJ affirm that it was or wasn’t?
If the locket of hair doesn’t fit, you must acquit.
John’s body was cremated but there are his sons.
What if the sons gave the hair?
Seems to be a hairy question to me?
What about Prince Harry’s hair?
Is the auction price going to more than John’s?
Hair, There and Everywhere.
The hair styles that Beatles wore evoked certain level of social change,
Not to mention that John recognized,
-at rightfully so, - later on so not!
The Beatles were more popular than Christ,
-and of all his hair.
If a single Christ hair were to be found,
A single hair of the Lord would fetch more than John’s lock.
