I must have died a thousand times
because everytime I see you smile I go breathless
So I fell for you, big deal...I'll be the one laughing
when you fall for me and I leave your heart
drowning in a pool of tears and memories.
I hope it's me that makes your body tremble at night
When will you realize what your doing to yourself?
you're doomed unless you pull yourself together
you fell for my trap now time only tells how long
I'll leave you in despair...Foolish mistakes will
lead you to make believe love and a tragic ending.
But I feel I'm lost in a dream world when I look into your eyes
Congratulations you made me suffer....
but it's your heart that will forfeit this game
