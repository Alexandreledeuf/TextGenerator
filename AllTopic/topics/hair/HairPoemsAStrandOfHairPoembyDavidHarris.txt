Hills and mountains are dotted
across our landscape fair,
at the top of either
you are at the roof of the world
looking down upon
all who live below.
You stand and gaze at the world
an all the riches it bestows.
Seeing everyone’s destiny
in a strand of hair.
Loves maybe invisible to the naked eye,
but you have to be blind
not to see it in someone else’s eyes.
Strangers pass on a street
neither ever seen the other before.
There is an attraction
that makes them stop and look around;
soon they are together
melting into one another’s arms.
Love is just a chance meeting
between strangers somewhere.
No one can prepare for it.
How can you prepare for something
you never know when it will happen?
The only thing you can do
is carry on doing what you have to do
and let cupid’s arrow fly
when and if it must.
You maybe smitten
if his aim is true,
in the meantime don’t lie
awake at night wishing for
what tomorrow might never bring.
Just go out and live a life
as normal as can be.
For love and cupid will seize
a chance when you are unaware.
