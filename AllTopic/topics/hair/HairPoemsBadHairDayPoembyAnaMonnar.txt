Bad hair day! Can you relate to this?
Is it P.M.S., hormones flaring or is it me –
If tempers are blazing, it’s best to stay away
Just give space to the person, who is upset,
Or things might be said that you will later regret
Wait for an explanation when things cool down
Maybe make up with a hug and a kiss
If you are a lady, “Can you relate to this? ”
