One Sunday morning I hurried on my way
And I arrived at my church ready to worship and pray
Then I saw a girl with blue-green hair
She walked away, not welcome there
I could see the tears falling down her face
I realized that I didn’t want to be in such a place
I looked at myself in my dress so neat
And then at the girl in her jeans and dusty bare feet
“Don’t be sad because you were turned away
We’ll find us a church where we both can stay”
With a smile on my face, I took her hand
And we both walked away from my church so grand
Soon a small wooden building I chanced to see
A young man smiled and greeted both her and me
The doors I saw were thrown open wide
“There’s a place for you both just right inside”
So many different people all worshipping the Lord
And the truth being preached straight from His Word
A place was found for us side by side
Welcomed by His love that we often hide
Let all church doors be thrown open wide
And all who approach be welcomed inside
Whether it be a woman with a refined air
Or a barefoot girl with blue-green hair
