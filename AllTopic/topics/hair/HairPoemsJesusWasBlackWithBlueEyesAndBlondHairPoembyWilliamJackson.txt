So I'm black
So I'm white
So I'm yellow
So I'm brown
Does anyone really see me
or just the color of my skin?
Really only two races exist:
the decent and the indecent.
Skin pigmentation
has nothing to do with it.
And
We all bleed red.
The last time I checked
we all put on our pants one leg at a time.
We laugh, we cry, we live, we die!
We could mix beautifully and have lovely children
with chocolate skin or deep deep shades of black and brown
or pale whites and lovely yellows with green eyes.
I would much rather kiss you on the lips
and celebrate life and the potential
for a wider gene pool than fight any day.
God either laughs or cries about enabling us
to see the various shades and colors of existence.
In my world Jesus is black with blue eyes and blond hair.
