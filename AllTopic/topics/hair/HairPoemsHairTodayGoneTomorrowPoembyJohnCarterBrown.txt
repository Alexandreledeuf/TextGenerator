I shudder to think
What life would be like
If women, like men, started thinning;
No peace would be found,
Men would go underground;
There'd be wailing and grief,
There'd be grinding of teeth,
And that would be just the beginning!
Hair-driers and dyes
Would be laid to one side,
As experts were given the time
To find a solution,
To make restitution
By each and all means,
To repairing the genes
Accused of this dastardly crime.
Yes, I shudder to think,
As all women, as one,
Bring all of their powers to bear;
To crush to submission
Illegal permission;
To mess with their beauty,
To ignore their duty
The genes have for growing their hair.
And if the malefactors
Are thinking they'll win
This battle in which they are caught,
They know not their fate,
They've no case to state,
No lesson was learnt,
Even try it, they daren't...
By the way - it was only a thought!
