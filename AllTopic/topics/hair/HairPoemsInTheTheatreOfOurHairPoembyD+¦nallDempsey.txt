We put our heads together
(hide behind our hair)
only kisses & promises
happen in here.
We put our heads together
(disappear behind our hair)
the world reduced to a single heartbeat
only love happens here.
We put our heads together
(the world disappears)
Time seems to pass us by
...who cares?
