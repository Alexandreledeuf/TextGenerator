Such golden thin strings
Yeah! I am talking about your hair
Long and natural so shining
Wears away my heart within a moment
Those are yours, those are shining
When they are carved into plaits
They do nothing but enhance your
beauty
Gazing gazing at them my only duty
When air rushes through them
I want that moment to be stopped
Such a beauty your hair has given
They add colours to all your elements
I want my life spent under that shade
I want myself everytime under that
blade
I want to live, I want to die
But I will never say you good bye
Your hair has made me so romantic
That only your hair, your hair
EVERYWHERE
