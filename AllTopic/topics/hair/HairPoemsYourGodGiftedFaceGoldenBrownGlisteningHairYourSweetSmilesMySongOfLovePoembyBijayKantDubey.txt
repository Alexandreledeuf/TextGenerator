Your God-gifted face,
Golden hair,
Glistening face,
Lustrous eyes,
Rosy cheeks,
Pink lips,
Admire I, appreciate I
Your fair and fine face,
Good looking,
Your voice so sweet and golden,
I admire you, admire and appreciate you,
A great beauty are you
So lovely to look at
With the golden locks hanging,
Tell me, who, who are you,
Lassie?
Who, who are you, blonde,
Belle so sweet,
Please pass by not,
Let me take a photo,
A girl never seen before,
Forcing me to compare with a balsam,
Brownish grey and glistening.
