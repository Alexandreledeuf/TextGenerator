An orphan saw a flower with golden hair
The sun shined her and lighted her in fully fair
Eyes refused to blink
Heart started to bet fast
Body was shaking
Blood denied to circle
Greenish became the Favorite chosen season
This will stay inside of orphan because he has reason
Blocked also controlled the anger for long journey
Tasted the hand made in added different recipe
Replaced blindly with inappropriate chosen
Sadly accepted realized his life has frozen
