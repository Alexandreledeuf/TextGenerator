Did I see a red hair vixen at several DSW’s?
A ‘canine’ with a fetish of shoes?
It can’t be.
Anyway it has; a wily fox outsmarted the bi-pedals taking their shoes.
I know that this fox has a German background,
She wasn’t a ‘desert fox’ I later found,
Was she related to General Rommel?
Anyway, to make a long story even longer,
This vixen cunningly stole pairs of shoes from people,
She could have stole them for toys,
-for her kits, or wear them in style.
Slippers, boots, and sneakers;
-she had taken them from various porches for awhile.
She tried and tried and tried,
To get the right shoes to fit.
The case was cracked when a forestry worker stumbled upon an astonishing scene in the woods:
-dozens of shoes lay strewn on the forest floor surrounding a fox's den.
Even more were discovered inside!
By the way,
'We found 86 shoes in the den and a further 32 in a nearby quarry,
-where they like to play.'
What were the clues?
Tiny little teeth marks on the shoelaces leads the Count to theorize that the vixen had
been stealing the footwear for her cubs to play with. That, or she 'simply likes
collecting shoes, ' say the locals.
And, really, who could fault a female for liking shoes?
Imelda Marcos had 2400 pairs in her ‘den’.
As far as the vixen correcting her ways.
Not a chance,
'More shoes have gone missing in the last few days.'
