Angel is a white Shih Tzu with patterns of white and gold,
Angel also comes to the names of Ang, and Angie I am told.
Mrs. Gaylin is her proud owner along with her spouse,
Angel is really cute and quiet as a mouse.
Mrs. Gaylin said Angels needs a haircut soon,
Mrs. Gaylin will take her for a haircut maybe at noon.
Now Angel is a is a rescue dog Mrs. Gaylin also did say,
they adopted her on one sunny day.
Going for walks Angel does go,
she is one of the Shih Tzu's at the condo.
