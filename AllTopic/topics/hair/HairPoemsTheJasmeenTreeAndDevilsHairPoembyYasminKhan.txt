So lovingly to soil she sent her roots
Now caresses the casement its lovely shoots
Starry flowers glow in twilight green
Dance in breeze and in dew they preen
The Jasmeen tree fragrance’s tender lore
Whispering perfumes to yonder shores
Hark! How envy grows out of its roots
Ringlets and threads like ropes brute
Malicious tresses wrap all around
Beauty so green is viciously confound
Pearly flowers tangled in raven hair
But who can capture the maiden so fair
She still stands tall in her turret bower
Laughing in sunshine glowing in shower
Necking birds and gemming flowers
Swing on boughs for hearts a dower
Poison of love wine outdone by balmy tower
Incensed symphony does float on air
Heaving through strangling weed’s snare
