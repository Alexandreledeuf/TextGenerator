(written in Palilan river, Palilan Jimenez, Mis. Occ.'Philippines
just a 10 m.. away from my home.A river is located at the back my
elem. grade school and to where i spent my concised childhood
moments, leisure times, chanting with friends, swimming, collecting shells, diving,
and escaping  from 'undefined responsibilities'..........
A sentimental wind
follows down river;
bands of finger
brush the long column
of nipa leaves
whispering among
long-legged roots
of mangrove trees
Combing out my hair
in thrilling touch
Pulling out all wrinkles
of fears
in facing of my  shadowy
future
and the wind dries up
all my tears
and the sole river remains
the  mute witness forever
