I am a Phantom of the opera
My breeze it unties the air
I have blue whispered vison's
And some very long silver hair
I dance down romance lane
That the Roses paved today
Glistening aromatic petals
Of a velvet-toned petal inlay
Whispers of private promises
Softly move throughout this space
Encounters of Origami lovers
Come at last face to face
While in the background
Playing a mystical mandolin
Pulsing out the melodies
Of where true love begins
Moving on over the ages
Together forever oh so rare
But not impossible at all
When it comes to being
Lady Silver Hair
