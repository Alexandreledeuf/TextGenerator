Your orange hair in the void of the world
In the void of these heavy panes of silence
Shade where my bare hands seek your image.
The shape of your heart is chimerical
And your love resembles my lost desire.
O sighs of amber, dreams, glances.
But you were not always here. My memory
Is still obscured by seeing your coming
And going. Time consumes words, like love.
