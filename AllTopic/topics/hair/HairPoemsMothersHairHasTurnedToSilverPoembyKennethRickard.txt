Mother's hair has turned to silver
Her skin is all wrinkled and cold
But i'd never trade my mother
For the world and all its gold.  Yes her hair has turned to silver
Her face is all covered with lines
But there'll never be another
Like this gray haired mother of mine.  I think of all the hardships
I have caused her to bare
Then I can see the reasons
For the silver in her hair.  Mother's hair has turned to silver
And her hard working days are done
But there's still a smile on her face
And a love for everyone.
