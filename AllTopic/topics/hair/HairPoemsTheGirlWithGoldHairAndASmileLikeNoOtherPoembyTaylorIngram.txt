Its just one more story left untold,
But, This ones different,
Its about a girl, Whos hair was gold,
She had a smile like no other,
Everyone thought she was happy,
But little did they know,
Her smile was fake,
She just wanted to leave, to go,
Be free from the pain shes in,
Her brother, 'He', 'Him',
Emotionly bruised her soul,
She wont let anyone touch her,
Fearing that she will lose control,
Her Father, 'Just another'
So mixed up in alchol and drugs,
He cant even tell how hurt she is,
Her eyes flood with red blood tears,
Her Mother, 'There, But not'
She knows, but doesnt help,
Trying to support a family on her own,
Too much stress, Not enough fears,
And the girl with golden hair,
And a smile like no other?
Well, She struggling to keep it all together,
Crying herself to sleep everynight,
Having to deal with her Brother, Father and Mother,
So do you think the girl with the Golden hair,
And  a smile like no other is really happy?
Well shes not, because her life is rather crappy.
