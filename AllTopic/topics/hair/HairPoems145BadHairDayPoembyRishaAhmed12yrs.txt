My mom would scream and run away
My plants would wither and die
My sister would think she is having a nightmare
My cousin would wish she knew how to fly
My dad would faint on the spot
My teacher would send me out of the class
My principal would expel me for sure
I wonâ€™t be allowed to write my exams
My music teacher would show me the door
I am in a complete fix
I wish there was another way
I should have listened to my mother
And combed my hair today.
