A butterfly can fly away,
A butterfly can be a kiss,
A butterfly can be such a gaze,
A butterfly can die just like that.
That's what happened to you.
God took you,
Turned you into a butterfly,
And you flew away.
Dedicated to Civanna Carlene Christian.
Ur My Butterfly Princess,
Rest in peace.
