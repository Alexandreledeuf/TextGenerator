A Romantic Dialogue
The Butterfly:
"O Bright Sunflower! How handsome you are!
Can I come and sit on your yellow petals?
Your sparkling luminosity makes me bounce with happiness,
Your golden hue makes me fly in circles with joyfulness,
Your symmetrical centre filled with seeds is, verily, blessedness! "
The Sun Flower:
"O Beautiful Butterfly! You are my muse!
No! Not the dazzling Sun who dazzles from a distant,
But You! My pretty Butterfly!
You are flitting around me all the time,
Playing and parading your shining wings,
Swinging and springing like a belly dancer!
Come! Let us dance and waltz around!
Or would you prefer to dance the Tango?
There is not much time for us to waste,
The sun will set by evening! Make haste!
You are here only for a day! Not more!
We are a perfect match,
Attired in glowing yellow shades,
Before the Sun drops his curtain,
Embrace me with your golden wings.! "
