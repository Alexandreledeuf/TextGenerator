A beautiful butterfly flies high above.
It gracefully emits, warm rays of love.
flies &  swings its wings, like a dove.
beautiful colours, it glitters like  gold
Sweet, calm, sweet message it holds
Warm, tender it’s lights never grow old.
It opens it wings & makes day brighter.
It sends sweet rays, makes heart lighter.
it breathes love, to make faces softer.
It warmly charms hearts, soul & minds,
cheerful smile, merit in it wing you’ll find.
The purest flush in it’s eyes wink so kind.
