Will you even notice when I'm gone?
The space no longer occupied by me
My existence fragments of a broken memory within your mind
And my hunger for you will go unfed
I am no longer there
I am a trapped butterfly that has broken free
And yet wherever I go, you are haunting me
I am damaged: my wings have been broken
You are crushing the butterfly that has been given to you
However loud I scream, you don't hear me
You have turned your back
When I am no longer here, you will mourn your love for me
Or will you even notice I'm gone?
