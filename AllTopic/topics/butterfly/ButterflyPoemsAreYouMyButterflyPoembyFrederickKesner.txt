My butterfly is no longer mine,
I wonder if she ever really was;
When she alights on my shoulder
I know she wants me to hold her -
Flies off and she's mine no longer.
My butterfly so frail and fine,
I wonder if hers I ever was;
When she returns to kiss me again
I know she's more than just a friend -
Flies off and gone forever more.
