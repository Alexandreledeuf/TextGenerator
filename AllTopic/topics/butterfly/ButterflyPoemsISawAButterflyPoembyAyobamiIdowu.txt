I saw a butterfly
I saw him well
The tears were in his eyes
They burned like hell
He looked like just the strongest one in this world
but if you touched him he could die
This lovely butterfly who dreamed of life
As he spread his wings to fly beyond the skies
He wished the world would see him for who he is
A lovely butterfly, not an eagle
The butterfly I saw
