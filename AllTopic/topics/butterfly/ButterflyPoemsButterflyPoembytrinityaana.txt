when its lonesome
its alone
perhaps
i live in a cage
it was forced on me
by and by
it grew on me
i liked it
or not
encased
secure
but
caged
one day i chanced
upon life
metamorphosed
my cage
my case
in a shackle
no more my
anchor
i try
i cry
i moan
to breakfree
alone me
from lonliness.....................
