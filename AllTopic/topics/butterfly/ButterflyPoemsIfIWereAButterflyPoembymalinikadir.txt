If I were a butterfly
I would fly to your garden
Through smoky glasses
Watch with baleful inquisitive eyes
Till with an impatient sigh
You my fluttering presence spy....
If you would just open your window
I would my presence keep sweeping low
Find an inconspicuous corner
In your flower vase
imbibing with pleasure
memories to treasure
Your casual time of leisure...........
When you threw down  your car keys
and kicked off your shoes
All the tiredness let
Trickle off with water
Splashed with a gusto!
You relax
l too relax with  you..................
The poise and tranquility
that we as a pair
to this four walled confines bring
No man and woman can............
