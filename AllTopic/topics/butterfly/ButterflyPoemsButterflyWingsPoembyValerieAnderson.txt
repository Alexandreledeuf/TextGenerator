Butterfly wings.
Dancing, shimmering lights.
They are the northern lights
of the south during the day.
Beautiful lime green.
Flash and flutter.
Dancing upon the walls.
Making such a clutter.
Those butterfly wings.
A light periwinkle blue.
As blue as the ocean.
Mysterious as the moon.
Reminds  me of that sky, full of clouds.
Those butterfly wings.
A deep blood red.
So vibrant and full of life.
A deep, swirling crimson.
So loyal and true.
Those butterfly wings.
A sparkling sunny yellow.
So bright and cheerful.
Almost like a lighter gold.
So friendly and caring.
Those butterfly wings.
Those wings hold character.
Opposites they hold as well as mystery.
So dark but light and sure.
Are those butterfly wings.
