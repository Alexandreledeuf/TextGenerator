A butterfly flew to my window pane
Beautifully black spotted and big
I could see it through the glass
It was not aware of my presence
As the Glass was tinted in black
Took some shots and done a video
Of my guest on the Window pane
Still stationing there for long
Then on a sudden it was gone
Into the vast chest of nature
Blessed and Beautiful are they
Though their lives are short
Am excited about my Guest
On my black window pane
Charmed by it's beautifully
Spread and decorated wings
God must have sent it to me
Like an angel from the heaven
To give some solace from
Otherwise, a tension full life.
