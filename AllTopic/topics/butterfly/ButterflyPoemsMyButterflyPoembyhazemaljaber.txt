i know, that you always asked about me...
and know that, to my talks you missed...
do you know..? ? ?
that you owned me..? ?
and waiting you with a thirst...
and miss your missing to me...
and my ear loving your whispers..
read me, ...
and write me, ...
as i am a white butterfly in your hands...
and draw me, ..
and give me a nicest colors..
which you have...
and in your heart hug me...
love you more, .. when you remembered me..
love you, even when you forgot me, ...
i forgot my soul, between your hands..
and come down to you, ..
to let me fly again from your hands...
