Butterfly, Butterfly
flew so high.
Butterfly, Butterfly
caught my eye.
Eyes were a glisten,
wings winked in delight.
Sought such a current
so as he could drift
in warm summer's night.
But as the days shorten
he sags in the air.
Gracefully curves
downwards,
until he lies
motionless
so calm and fair.
