Vulnerable, soft and fragile
Delicate to the touch
Dodging, ducking, evading
Every attempt to clutch
Indian lore has told me
A butterfly can grant a wish
But first it must be captured
And my desire whispered to it
For the whisper to be granted
The butterfly must be set free
A difficult choice I ponder
Will my butterfly come back me?
