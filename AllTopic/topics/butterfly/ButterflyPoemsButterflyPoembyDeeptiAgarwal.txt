Flying high, being a butterfly
sings aloud in deep forests
let me drink the nector to my full
seems which is made just for me!
When I open my Rainbow wings
smiles, feeling elated
heights of that high sky
its that, Now I want to touch! !

This is the literal translation of my 'Titali'.. for the ones who cannot understand hindi.
