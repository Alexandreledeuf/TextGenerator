Butterfly moon of a flightless dawn.
Marching softly with a rhythm gone.
Angels coming in a darkened morn.
Demons ascending in a vertical form.
Found again from a wanton wish.
Lost eternity in a broken kiss.
Seas of destruction branding my mind.
Pounding relentlessly as the clock unwinds.
The way and beyond from a fluttered wing.
Dancing joyously as my soul sings.
Breathing again from a wound once clean.
Broken strength begs for thought unseen.
Deception expired as dreams ring clear.
Awareness dawns as the butterfly moon nears.
