Butterfly; butterfly fly away,
teach me how to be as free as free can be.
Butterfly; butterfly I see you there,
its beautiful the way your wings caress the air.
Butterfly; butterfly go as high as you can go,
show me the things that I don't yet know.
Butterfly; butterfly fly into the sky,
dropp down and land yourself by my side.
Butterfly; butterfly I see you kiss a flower,
my eyes fill and I begin to ponder.
Butterfly; butterfly your beauty soars,
I see the beauty in you and I see the beauty within me.
Butterfly; butterfly show me the way,
For beauty is beautiful but there's more to me.
Butterfly; butterfly show yourself,
I see your colors and I see your shimmer, is there anything else?
Butterfly; butterfly what is the matter?
can't you give me an answer for the questions I desire?
Butterfly; butterfly I see you dying,
life is far too short to sit around crying.
Butterfly; butterfly don't you go,
for your goal has not yet been accomplished.
Butterfly; butterfly let me lift you,
I peer into your eyes and see that there's a secret inside.
Butterfly; butterfly let it out,
your secret could hold great things, give me the secret to life.
Butterfly; butterfly let me know,
before you take your last breath; show me what you hold.
Butterfly; butterfly there you go...
You twitch away letting me that the secret to life is having the courage...
to just let go.
