Butterfly
Will your wings curl up at the first sign of frost
Butterfly?
Will you hide away when the winter comes
Retreat into your  cocoon
Butterfly?
Will you come when spring dawns?
Will you pretend like you never left?
Butterfly
I want you to remain here with me
Forever
And don't let me be lonely
Don't let me be sad
Because if you must leave me
I'll never find another
Butterfly
You flap your wings in the breeze
Make me oh so happy
Please flap those wings for me
Please stay here with me
And when winter comes
I will keep your wings warm
Butterfly
