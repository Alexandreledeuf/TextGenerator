Allow me
To push back your hair
And kiss the butterfly tattoo
On the nape of your neck
As we walk in the summer rain.
We may face death
By tomorrow dawn,
But today we have
Excited breaths
And yearnings
That cannot be suppressed.
If you fail to grasp love
In the heat of this moment,
Nothing will matter later
If youâ€™re unhappy and alone.
