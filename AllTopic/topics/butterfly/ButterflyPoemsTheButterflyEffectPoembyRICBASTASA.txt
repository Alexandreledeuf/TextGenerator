when you swat a fly
another glacier crumbles
to the bottom of the sea
another cruise ship sinks
when you slap a servant
another economic system in Europe collapses
millions will be jobless
when you abort an innocent fetus
another unknown virus plagues
with no known cure
in China, Africa and India
but if you are kind and compassionate
to the ant carrying a morsel of bread
global warming becomes another myth
there will be sufficient rice and wheat
there will be so much food to eat.
