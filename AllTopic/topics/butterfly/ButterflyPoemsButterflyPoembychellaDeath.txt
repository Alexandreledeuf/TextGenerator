there in the sky you see a butterfly
fly little one fly
if is beautiful with a purple and black color
would you do me a favor
bring me my butterfly into my heart
I want to make it into art
I don't think god think's butterflys are bad
if he did then thats sad
I wish that they did not have sixs dots
I like them lots
I hate hannha monntana she give's butterflys a bad name
she's not the same
butterfly might tell your future in your life
maybe become husband and wife
butterfly is beautiful I wish it had eight dots
very lots
