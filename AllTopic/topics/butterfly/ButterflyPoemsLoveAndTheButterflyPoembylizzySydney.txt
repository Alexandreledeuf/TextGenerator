Love is like a butterfly
never here nor there
high or low
not really watching where to go.
A first love is like a butterfly
hatching out of a cocoon
we are amazed by the beauty
of this new feeling.
True love is like a butterfly
spreading its wings
and starting towards the sky
knowing that they want to have this forever.
Loosing love is like a butterfly
laying its eggs then flying away to die
leaving them in this big world all alone
knowing nothing familiar only home.
Wanting for love is like a butterfly
still as a caterpillar
wanting those wings
to be just like his friends.
Love is like a butterfly
Trying to spread its wing and fly
Love is like a butterfly
It can stay or it can die.
