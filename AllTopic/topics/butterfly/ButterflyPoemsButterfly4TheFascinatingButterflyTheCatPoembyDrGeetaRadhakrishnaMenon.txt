The cat is fascinated!
Stares in wonderment,
Still and silent,
With amazing rounded eyes,
With golden brown hair,
At a pretty butterfly
A rare black and white combination with
An ochre yellow border,
so elegantly shaped,
So artistically decorated,
Searching for a flower
In the grassy bower!
The cat watches in a trance!
The cat debates: "Should she pounce on the butterfly?
Or just chase her around for fun!
Or Should she quietly watch its enchanting movements
Sucking the honey from the flowers? Indeed!
Sensational play of nature's allurement! "
I wonder! Who is more fascinating?
The butterfly or the cat?
I am at a loss! For I love them both!
They are both fabulous creations of God!
Amazing lives that gladdens your heart,
Attractive beings of this beautiful planet!
