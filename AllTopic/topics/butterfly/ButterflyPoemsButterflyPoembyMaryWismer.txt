Went down to the garden
and see a Caterppilar
Crawling struggling on the earth
In reality she is a butterfly
Working out for her rebirth,
and after her rebirth,
She's going to fly.
She is going to shed
that heavy coat and bounded
chain and take on her new wings.
and fly high above the sky.
If we are a worm
covered with the dust,
trying hard to please
but afraid to fail
and feel like
having nailed.
Remember we are a butterfly inside.
and he is going to shed the coat
and his nailed had set us free.
If we hang in there
You'll see, we are a butterfly
we are going to shed the coat
and someday reach,
Reach for the sky.
