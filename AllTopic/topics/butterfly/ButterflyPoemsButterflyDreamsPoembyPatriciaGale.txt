Oh to be a butterfly and flutter my wings by your check
To have you admire me as I glide by your beautiful smile
To land upon your shoulder and watch you breathe
Oh to hear your voice sweetly recite
as you versed with magic tones
I would fly within your view
And from your sweet, sweet lips you would say,
Beautiful butterfly how I wish this night  you were real
So I could hold you in my arms and love you always
Then the words would spin
My wings caught up in the twirl
And before your eyesâ€¦
I would be in human form
in your arms, forever more
