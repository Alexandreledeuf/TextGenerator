Nobody knows this little butterfly,
who wanders and roams
who seeks for the senses of love,
Nobody knows her, so tender so pure,
little butterfly, her colors are baby pastels
like new souls and holy spirits of bliss.
Every petal touched by her caterpillars
become an essences to the touch, her
ultraviolet sight that only she can posses,
The wonder of her unique little body and
sense, nobody knows her, nobody
sees the beauty in her.
Only the blissful only the lovers
of love, nobody knows her,
nobody sees her, because those who see
are blind to her colors and soul,
I am a butterfly
