I'm a bleeding butterfly.
My wings are made of glass but are strong enough to carry me.
My spirit glides like the summer breeze..
Fragile yet untouched.
I'm a bleeding butterfly,
I will leave a rainbow in your sky
with a trail of tears behind me.
To love me is fatal,
To feel me is toxic.
To touch me would break me.
The thought is too much.
