I captured a butterfly in a jar
I danced around in the grass for hours
Chasing it down stumbling falling laughing
Making the chase the most rewarding
I captured a butterfly in a jar
There it was for me to hold and keep forever
Anytime I wanted to relish in the joy of life
There it was for me to look upon
I captured a butterfly in a jar
Time eroded on and all things change
The butterfly became just another bug
Trapped in a glass cage
I captured a butterfly in a jar
And saw how sad it truly was
A prisoner and I the jailer
I had to let it go
I captured a butterfly in a jar
I opened that lid and allowed it to go
And it flew away far from me
It left me yearning for that summer day
I captured a butterfly in a jar
But maybe it captured me
Because ever since that butterfly flew away
I have never again felt free
