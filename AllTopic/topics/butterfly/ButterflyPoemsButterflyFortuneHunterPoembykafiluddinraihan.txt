The little wings,
Bearing the colors,
Moving around the flower,
Charming her,
Kissing the petals,
Taking all the honeys,
Again forget her,
Leave her alone,
Take shelter of another,
Again making love,
The consequences are same,
May be he is the beauty,
But he is the fortune hunter,
The little butterfly...
