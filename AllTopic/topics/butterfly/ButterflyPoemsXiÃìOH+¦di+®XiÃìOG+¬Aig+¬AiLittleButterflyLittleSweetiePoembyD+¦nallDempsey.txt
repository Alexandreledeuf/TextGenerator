The stars
finding it hard
to keep their eyes
open.
Moon
tucked up
in a comfortable cloud
already fast
asleep
turns & smiles.
Even the dark
is nodding off
dreaming of
...light
Even the cricket
has gone
asleep
even the fire
sleeps
in a nightdress
of ashes
all this
dreamy night.
Only the baby
(our little sweetie)
lies awake
playing with
the bright butterfly
dancing in her
dress of brilliant colour
bobbing
on the string
before her.
She tells the butterfly
delightedly
over & over
that she is
beauty
but the butterfly
doesnâ€™t understand
the language of gurgle.
Somewhere
in the dark
Da da
snores
Ma ma
sleeps quiet.
