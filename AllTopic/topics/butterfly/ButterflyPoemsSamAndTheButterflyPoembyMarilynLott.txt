One day I saw a sweet butterfly
Just as pretty as can be
My coal black tomcat, Sam
Was walking next to me
A beautiful summer day
I smiled and hummed a song
Enjoying this flitting butterfly
As Sam and I walked along
And suddenly, youâ€™ll not believe
Without a single sound
Sam swiped his paw into the air
Knocking this butterfly to the ground!
