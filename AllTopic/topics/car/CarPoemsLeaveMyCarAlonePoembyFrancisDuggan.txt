By stuffing newspaper up the exhaust of my car
Somebody I do not know have taken their fun too far
I do not have a known enemy and I'm new to this Town
Why is someone I do not know trying to drag me down?
My car it felt sick and I rang the R A C V
And what the mechanic discovered a huge surprise to me
A newspaper rolled up blocked the exhaust pipe rear
By some not too nice person it was pushed in there.
I am not without sin I will not cast the stone
But if you do not like the look of me leave my car alone
You do unto others what you'd like them do to you
Those words not by me but those words seem so true.
Against the person who did this I could not hold a grudge
And since I am not meant to be anyone's judge
Of that karma will surely take care
What goes around comes around that does seem fair.
Some non thinking person with low self esteem
Could only do something like this it would seem
And I would like to say to this person leave my old car be
You should not harm my car if you do not like me.
I am new to this Town here not many I know
And all I ask of anyone is a fair go
I am not without sin I will not cast the stone
And if you do not like the look of me leave my car alone.
