I was born for driven dirt race car's
I'm not made for pavin long roads
I ain't cut out to climb high line poles
But I'm pretty good at driven my race car's
I'm not the type to work in a bank
I'm no good at slappin on things
Do have a knack for makin motors crank, no
But I'm pretty good at driven my rocket race car's
So give  me one more lap
That's what I'm here for
I'm built for having a ball
I love the dirt race track's
'I love my rocket race car
I like it 25 laps or more
I like staring way in the back
It give me more time to come up fast
I'm too slow for workin' too fast
I don't do windows so honey don't ask
But I'm pretty good at driven my race car's
A go getter maybe I'm not
I'm not known for doin' a lot
But I do my best work out on the track
I'm pretty good at driven my race car
So give me one more lap
