Decided are my ways;
Altered are my days,
for I know where to move;
For I know the way to reach.
My destination is too far to being seen.
With a map set in my mind,
With a slow speed I will start,
the engine of my car.
Well I am the lone driver,
I am the lone traveller;
Gear is set.
Mind is set right.
Mirror is well set up,
So that I get the three dimensional view.
Slowly I accelerated the speed,
Now I know the ABC of life,
I know when to apply break,
I know when to accelerate the speed
I know when to use clutch.
Here I am set to go!
I have to keep on moving,
On the same speed,
With my eyes and ears open,
My mind should work in coordination with,
My eyes, ears and hands.
My wonder car started,
Moving ahead all way.
It will wait for none,
Till my brain is in gear.
I will not turn back.
In between I will put a break
To give a pause to my brain too.
My wonder car started
Its moving towards a new way.
Through the path that seemed to be rough and smooth.
Today, Nothing matters me much.
I have to move ahead through unknown path.
With a steering controlled by my hand and mind.
I will move ahead with thrill and reach my destination.
