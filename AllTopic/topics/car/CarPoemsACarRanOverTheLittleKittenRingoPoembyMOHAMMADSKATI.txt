Two days ago while Ringo was crossing the street into the sidewalk Suddenly a careless driver ran over the little kitten Ringo,        His mom called Possy did not about that accident, but                She gave birth to four little kittens in the same day Ringo had that Accident,                                                           Possy cared about Ringo, but                                         His fate was not a matter of questioning,                               We all felt sorry for Ringo's death, but                            We can not do anything,                                             Ringo rests in his tomb for ever, so                                 No fear about him anymore.
