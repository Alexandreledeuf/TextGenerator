Gordon Loft was a traffic officer working radar duty
Whose wife and daughter was in a family beauty
His crew were operating the radar on Gorge road
And detected an offender in speeding car mode
So Gordon walked out on the hot bitumen
To indicate to this driver who was without acumen
The driver swerved into Gordon knocking him down
And he was killed lying broken on the ground
His mates quickly ran to his aid
And the driver in his escape made
There was nothing left to be done
Except find the driver who had run
So they found and charged him for Gordon's death
And he was jailed but it did not diminish tragedy's breath
So again a family was left to carry on without a father
To compound the mess in a final grief to gather
Was the death of the wife in a crash which appalled
And we wonder how the daughter survived in justice called
