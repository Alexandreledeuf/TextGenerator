We came out early on that Tuesday afternoon
I didn't want to part just yet for you to be gone so soon
A cable car ride suggested, it quickly took your mind
We took a tube to Greenwich and traced around O2
No sooner than we knew it we were at the ticket office
And with oyster discounts in our hand and wristbands strapped on tight
It was not long before we took off upon our circular flight
Enclosed in glass we swept up to greyed out skies
The wind picked up and swayed us on our cable
I hoped that one such gust would place your hand in mind
But you proved to be the braver one you never moved a finger
I desperately wanted to put my hand in yours but was frightened still to do it
But it wasn't' the wind but love youknow that made we want to do it
The moment passed with a GPS joke and then onto costa coffee
