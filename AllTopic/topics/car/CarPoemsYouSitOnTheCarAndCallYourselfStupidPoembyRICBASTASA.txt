you sit inside the car
as i drive on this busy road
in the city, on some dangerous
intersections, and you hold your hair
with your left hand
leaning on the mirror
seeing the flow of people
on the pedestrian lane
and you quip,
why do you love a stupid
woman like me?
i focus myself on the road
and it begins to rain
and people are running
everywhere seeking
for shelter
you ask,
do you really love me?
i am sorry
putting you on this mess.
i am really sorry,
tears begin to roll
from your eyes
the rain goes heavily on
the glass and i cannot clearly
see the road
it is dark and i turn on the
front lights and drive
the car slowly on the side
of the road. I stop
for a while,
it is hazy, i said.
and i just love to kiss you.
