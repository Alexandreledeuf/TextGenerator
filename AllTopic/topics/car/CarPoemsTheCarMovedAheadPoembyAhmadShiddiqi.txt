The car moved ahead
At its steady pace
One meter in front of the other
It is amazing to know
How Pierre can survive for so many years
In the middle of uncertainty if it was love or hate
The sky had begun to threaten
Very early in the morning
And the rain was pouring so strange
(dedicated to a great poet, Mark Strand)
