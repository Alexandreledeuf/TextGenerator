A fun fill ride it was
though it scare the hell out of us
Bumping up and down in the car
Stopping and going so suddenly
But still fun we had though
you can hear swearing everywhere
Everyone swearing i would not
get in the car again if there a next time
Lucky it was late late in the night
and not many cars in sight
most lucky no police car  (hehehe)
and we did all got back safe and sound
