I close my eyes
And it pops in my head
Now im wishing i was dead
For all i hear is hold on
Whike the white flys far
I cant think or breath
I cant even move my feet
The pain shoots through me
While my organs bleed
I guess you never know
When im going to leave
Now i no longer want to sleep
For as far as i can see
You already did the dirty deed
Now im stuck right here
In the pain of this day
Police lights
Oil leaks
I guess its a surprise
That we are even alive.
