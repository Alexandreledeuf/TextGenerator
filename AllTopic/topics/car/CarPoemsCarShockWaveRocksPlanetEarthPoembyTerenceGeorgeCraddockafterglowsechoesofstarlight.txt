some people male female
get out of cars slam doors
like throwing heavy boulders
the entire car shock wave rocks
goes through surprised heads
like elephants crushing egg shells
zen is tranquil quiet calm patient
sudden head bouncing on shoulders
earth is like this when nuclear tests
massive are exploded beneath surface
shock waves ripple in ground swells
earth quiet tested in ant mind experiments
relax rocked people car door is still on hinges
it is not nuclear tests just slamming doors
