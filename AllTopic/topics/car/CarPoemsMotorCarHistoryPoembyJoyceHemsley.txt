Of Morris Motors fame,
William Richard was his name
William Richard Morris Nuffield
Viscount Baron, born in Britain
eighteen seventy-seven...died
in Britain nineteen sixty-three.
His success story began with
a humble cycle repair shop,
but there, business did not stop as
eventually Morris Motors did thrive
and in nineteen-twenty, the Morris
Cowley was a popular car to drive.
What could be finer than a black
Morris Minor...I once owned one myself
and happy was I.  In later years
Morris and Austin 'merged' as part of
British Leyland. William was made
Viscount ~ the founder of a motor
car empire, giving his millions to
Medical Research, and setting
hearts afire.  He was Founder of the
Nuffield College and the Nuffield
Foundation, bringing a touch of magic
to our striving nation.  Britain will
ever remember this interesting and
important step in industrial salvation.
