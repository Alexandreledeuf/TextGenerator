while driving my car late evening
from school
when the rains fall heavily
on the streets
looking like deserted
i talk to myself
unceasingly
like we are very close friends
and now for the first
time in 20 years meet
for this historic reunion
i greet myself with such a warm
hello ric
this is ric meet ric
how you have not changed for years
you still look wonderful tonight
and how are things doing with you?
i am fine and doing well
and i am at home with myself
progressing in my career
and happy with what
i have and what i am
looking forward
to more excitements
of my life
like you do too
with your life
ric to ric
the talk goes on and on
and then the rain stops
and then i finally arrive
and honk my car
to this house
where the gate opens
all too quickly
with anticipation
like this joy
of an emotion
the lights are all on
brightly they shine
on the glass
of the car
i am home
at last
