So, it’s just a silly car wash?
My friend, it’s so much more!
It’s an opportunity to help—
A noble cause now at your door.
You say she’s not that dirty
And that you can’t afford to stop;
I say just think of the purpose
And let us wash her, bottom to top.
Let the volunteers of this good cause
Wash away the filth and slime.
Would you give a nice donation?
Would you make a little time?
Remember, Jesus taught us
“’Tis better to give than receive.”
May we wash your car today?
Help us, our goal to achieve.
