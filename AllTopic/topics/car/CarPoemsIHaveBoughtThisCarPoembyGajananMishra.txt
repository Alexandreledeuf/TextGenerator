I have bought this car
By my own money
I am driving my own car
Under the control of material nature.
My wife my son my daughter
All are here helping me
In this life-driving, my dear
Let me be a free driver.
O my dear, You have given me the licence
To drive this car here and there
You have given me the chance
To fight with water and fire.
I know it is I who is responsible for the accident if any
I know my car my licence are subject to seize for reckless drive.
