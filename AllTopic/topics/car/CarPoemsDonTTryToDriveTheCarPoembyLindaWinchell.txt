Don’t try to take the driver’s wheel
When someone is spinning out of control.
Just let them make their own wrong turns
And… let the wheel go!
If we’re always sitting in the drivers seat
One will never know how to drive.
Just sit and be God’s passenger…and pray
And allow that driver to drive.
They’re in the best of hands you know
God is sitting in the back.
He oversees just what we need
So just enjoy the trip…relax!
