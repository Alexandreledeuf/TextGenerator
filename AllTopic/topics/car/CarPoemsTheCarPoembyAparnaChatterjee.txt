Smokes
The driver
Smokes
The air
Feels
So fresh
With their
Smokes ;)

Written after seeing a man smoking while driving his car.
Obviously we all know that vehicles do contribute to air and sound pollution with their smokes and horns ;)
Time, health and weather permitting, we should always opt for walking instead of taking our car / bike / scooter or public transport esp. if the distance is short and walkable. I've always loved walking and even in freezing, pouring UK weather, I've ventured out on errands without depending on cars or buses though at times, when my health plays truant, I pamper myself with some vehicular luxury :)
