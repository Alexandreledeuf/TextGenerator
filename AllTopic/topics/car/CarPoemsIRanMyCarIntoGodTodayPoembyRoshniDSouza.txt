I ran my car into God today;
I thought I had the right of way.
He says He’s suing after all;
Can you believe the Almighty gall.
“What happened to your spiel on Love? ”
“Not right now, Ms. Gilles Villeneuve!
I’ve been trying to get your whole attention;
I’m tired of your so-called good intention! ”
But I have things to do, a schedule to keep;
That Sunday check, it is not cheap!
Clients, family, even a yard,
And a shoddy attempt to be a bard.
But He tells me He’s feeling quite neglected;
Always the last one to be selected.
So I’m thinking “a little TLC”
And, just maybe, I could go scott-free.
I suggest coffee in a couple of days.
“I’m giving up caffeine! ”, so He says.
“So, what are my options? ” I almost yell.
“I thought you’d never ask to tell.
Take Me with you. I’ll ride along! ”
“A ride along? Now that's just wrong!
Will You pick the radio stations too? ”
“Is that too much to ask of you? ”
I threatened I would write about this…
“Go ahead! Won’t be your first hit-and-miss! ”
“Alright! Alright! Just come along,
But don’t say much and don’t sing that song! ”
So in order to prevent litigation,
I’m taking Him along…even on vacation!
