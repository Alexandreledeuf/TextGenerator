The Christmas tree has dried to brittle green
Gifts are stacked within the bedroom closet
Santaâ€™s visit costs more than children glean
Money runs free like water from faucet
My car is broke again I must repair
Damages to plug, pump and oil pan
Now in the season of excessive care
My mechanic made a lucrative plan
The elves inside your engine must be quelled
With regular maintenance and good gas
Visit me once a month he smiled and yelled
While I walked away frowning, one sad lass
Find a new car - a good resolution
One that runs is a better solution
