Once we had a car,
that was the colour of silver grey.
Now this little car, who we called our jam jar,
just loved a rainy day.
She would drive around for hour's,
with her wiper's turned on,
they would race back and forwards,
until the rain had compleatly gone.
Her brakes were truely majic,
when pulled up at a halt.
Then a funny sort of sound would come,
as if she was saying' that ain't my fault!
This lovely little car of our's,
was just a little dream,
driving down the highway,
with her headlights on full beam.
Everytime it rained, she always looked bright,
even if we were driving,
all through the night.
The crome on her bumper,
shone like stars in the sky.
Then everything seemed to change,
when the weather turned dry.
The jam jar, would not start,
because her battery woulden't charge,
so jump leads were needed,
with a push, shuve and a barge.
If we went on our holidays,
and the weather was fine,
we always prayed for rain,
so we would reach there on time.
In seventy six, there came a heatwave,
and the weather was boiling hot.
The same thing happened to our jam jar,
then she gave her last breath,
and died there on the spot.
