Pretty Girl in a shitty car
Headliner hanging
Tailpipe dragging
Beauty Queen of broken dreams
Had the world on string
Or so it seemed
Growing up pretty
Doesn’t create pity
It creates a single road
No one informed you
That a good life is earned
Not owed
Needed to be a Mrs
Afraid to be missed
You gave your only quality
Didn’t think you had a mind to share
But your pretty self alone
Couldn’t keep “him” there.
Made babies born with a Job
Mixing “him” and Pretty you
Instead of fulfilling your purpose
The babies became discarded trash too.
Pretty Girl now a waitress
Cleaning up other peoples messes
Cant clean up your own
Feet hurt
Ass hanging out of a small skirt
Get in your shitty car
Hoping it will start
Hoping you still have a home
