How I adore a bright sunny morn
Glorious summer glistening with light
Reminiscent of days in the blue Ford Anglia
When we travelled the road ~ love at its height.
Again I can see the whole picture
Of the hills and heather so sweet,
The scenery resembling an island of dreams
As our blue Ford Anglia made happiness complete.
Secretly, I offer a silent prayer
Those bygone days still live in my heart.
Just we two, in that little car of blue
Admiring the magnificence of God's works of art.
