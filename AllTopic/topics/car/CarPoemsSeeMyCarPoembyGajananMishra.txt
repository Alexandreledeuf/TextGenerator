See my car,
I am driving the car
Ask not its name and number
I have already mentioned elsewhere here.
See my car,
I am driving the car,
Controlling the steering wheel
I am driving the car,
Giving due respect to
Accelerator and brake,
I know here in this car
There is the truth called engine,
Passion and action are there
In fuel and I know all knowledge
And everything is there in tool box
Provided by the company itself.
See my car
I am going with my car
To the service center
As it is not running well
As it met an accident
Though no fault of mine,
All of a sudden it met an accident
With the rain and the sun.
