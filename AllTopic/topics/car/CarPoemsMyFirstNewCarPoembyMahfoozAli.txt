I will never forget the day I bought my first new car,
And had a date with a girl that lived not too far,
We drove out into the suburbs and parked under a full moon,
And listened to the car radio play a brand new tune,
And if my neighbour would ever ask who the girl was,
That was in the car,
I will tell them it was my late mother
who's on her way to heavenly abode,
The day I bought the car.
