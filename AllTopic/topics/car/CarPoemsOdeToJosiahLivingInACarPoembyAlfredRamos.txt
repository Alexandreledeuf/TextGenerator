He ran
Fast as anyone can
Away from home
He chose to roam
Didn’t get along
But he took his song
He ran far
Now living in a car
Not much company
Such an epiphany
Freedom rang
Every time he sang
Sleeping in his car
His pillow his guitar
Song his creation
The road his destination
Dreams he has many
Doubts, no room for any
His heart so large
His soul in charge
Living in a car
Guided by a star
As if blind
He left so much behind
Stubbornly he wanted more
Wind beneath his wings to soar
Fast foods, fast times
Hard hills, hard climbs
Living in a car
Healing of a scar
Like a baby bird has flown
Alone into a zone unknown
Why he made a dash
Was he headed for a crash?
He made a hard choice
Hoping for one to hear his voice
Can this boy sing?
To him it’s everything
And it will do him good
He’s going to Hollywood
