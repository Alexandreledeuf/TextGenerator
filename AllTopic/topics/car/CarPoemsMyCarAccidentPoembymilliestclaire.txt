Driving on a cold winter night,
drove with tears drowning my sight.
Didnt know where to turn
Drove into a ditch and felt a burn.
Lights blinding me in my eyes,
You could see the fears i tried to disguise.
I never thought i would make it out alive,
but God was there to help me strive.
So many thoughts going through my brain
I loved you once, but not again.
If i didnt get out of the car soon
I wouldnt live to see the shiny moon.
I was hospitalized for 2 weeks, in a coma for one of those weeks.
You never would have none, because you didnt ask,
While you forgot my name,
I forgot how much i cared about you.
But while in the hospital, i was thinking about dying,
I was thinking about you, and how you forgot everything you shared,
i got in a real car accident, but in the end, the only accident i got in, was letting you in to my heart and life.
