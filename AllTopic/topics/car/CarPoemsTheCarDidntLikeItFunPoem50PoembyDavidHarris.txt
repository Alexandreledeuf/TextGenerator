I went to a party
just the other night.
The meal was atrocious
and a bad time was had.
Just to add insult to injury,
the car didn’t like it neither
being left alone out in the cold.
Therefore, when I went to start it,
it didn’t want to go.
The protest was duly noted
and a jump-start was given.
Finally, we got home
cold, tired and weak.
Went straight to bed
and could have slept for a week.
Unfortunately, I had
to get up early the next morning
for work I had to go.
I think I’ll treat the car
to a new battery this year,
so it will start first time
if the weather gets severe.
