Are you born to be a race car driver?
Even if not, many of you are a race traveler.
Many are ambitious, would like to beat the other,
On any cost became a winner.
When one is a winner, there are many loser,
Competition, hatred, anger & jealousy, but never laughter.
Is it worth to push for winning?
And became the most envied hated being.
