inside the car one rainy day
one sees the scattering of people
who do not have anything
tears fall on your cheeks thinking
that you are miserable
you finally wipe them and look
at those other miseries of
children pushing carts to
hide their wares
of drivers looking
for their hard earned money
of women disappointed for
loss of customers
tonight
this damn rainy day that finally
gives you the comfort that
at least despite all your
self-invented sorrows
your
own chaos
you are still one
God damn lucky guy
