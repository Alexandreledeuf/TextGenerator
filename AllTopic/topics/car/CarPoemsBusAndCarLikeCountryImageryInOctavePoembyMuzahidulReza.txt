Suddenly accelerating the running state
The leaders unexpectedly braked hard
As they treat it a bus old and unrepaired
The passengers like citizens got jerked
Some died, some wounded, some injured
Fortunately the state was not crushed
But stopped partly for a few days
The citizens sighed through sufferings.
