Once apon a time, long, long ago
Daddy's car broke down when he bumped into a doe.
Mummy got her mobile, and called it to get towed
But when the fella came he said it was too big a load.
Brother bought an Ipod and listened all the while
Sister in the back put all her toys into a pile.
Daddy had a little fight with big man with a truck,
Mummy held a little tight to sisters toy pet duck.
Brother started singing when his favorite tune came on,
Daddy got a bruise when he said big man wieghed a tonne.
Mummy in the back looking for a big band-aid,
Sister saying help as she got on her knees and prayed.
i live in a family of nuts, so what more can i say
Other than i was surprised when that dead doe ran away.
