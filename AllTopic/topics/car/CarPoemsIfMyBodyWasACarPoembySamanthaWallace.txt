If my body was a car,
I'd trade it in for a newer model.
For I think I need a towbar,
From the dents I've endured in battle.
My paint job is a little dull,
My headlights are out of focus.
I'm no longer very mobile,
My body's an old aged carcass.
My bodywork's full of varicose scratches,
I'm in need of cosmetic work.
My brakes make nasty screeches,
That stops me with a jerk.
My traction is not as graceful,
I slip and slide and skid.
I have to drive quite careful,
Never mind what weather I'm in.
It takes me hours to reach a speed,
My fuel rate burns inefficiently.
I need some TLC to succeed,
And nice accessories that are costly.
Every time I sneeze or cough,
My radiator leaks.
My exhaust backfires a lot,
And my tires now tend to squeak.
Yes, if my body was a car,
I'd trade it in for sure.
I think I'd choose a jaguar,
With a body all slick and grandeur!
