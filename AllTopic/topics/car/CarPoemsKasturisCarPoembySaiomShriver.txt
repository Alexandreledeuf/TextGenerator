English professor and poet Narayana Kasturi
was an employee of All India Radio.
He had in an Indian humor magazine
made fun of Sathya Sai Baba. After
a series of miracles involving his
family, he became a devout follower
and editor of Baba's magazine
Sanathana Sarathi (eternal charioteer,
a reference to Krishna who would not
fight in the Mahabharata war but instead
was charioteer for Arjuna.)
One day a car caravan as often happened
was following Baba's car to a destination.
One after another, parts fell off of Kasturi's
car. When they arrived Kasturi took the car
to a mechanic who said it was physically
impossible for the car to have arrived.
Kasturi went to Baba and asked 'Was it
because we are good devotees that you
did this miracle for us? ' and Baba replied
'The car, the car is a great devotee.'
