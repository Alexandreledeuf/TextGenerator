You are a brown dumpster
With wheels. And me smiling,
Wearing my new sunglasses
Driving you crazy sitting on
Your rubber wobbly
Roof.
I drink another diet coke
And throw it in the back
With the other 500 cans
And the papers, and the gum
Stuck to the carpet like it’s
Got teeth.
Burrito bell smell attacks!
68 empty mickie D bags.
You can slide your steel
Door to let out the animals
And insects that call you
Home.
Sitting on a trash receptacle
I chuckle as people stare
At us scraping up the road,
Chewing concrete like cupcakes,
Our sparks screaming bloody
Murder.
I throw a half a Whopper
Into the back seat as we
Pull up to the drive (threw)
And you, monster dumpster,
Breathing heavy @ doesn’t fit.
Too rusty.
The lady screams at us.
Get the hell out of dodge!
Gotta make it to hardy’s
Though. Need some lipids.
You’re a brown rubbish bin.
Overflowing.
