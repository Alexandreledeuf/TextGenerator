Car is taking me,
whose car? I feel
not necessary to know,
it is not mine, I am sure.
To truth, I want to go,
with the car but where the truth is,
that is not known to me,
and the car is taking me on its own.
Is the car under my control?
I am putting this question to myself
and the car is dithering
and the company is taking steps
for servicing and replacing the parts
damaged so far.
