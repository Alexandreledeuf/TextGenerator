Walls of white surround
Constant beeping is the only sound
Can’t move, I cry out in pain
Then they sedate me again
Lights are flashing
The ambulance is arriving
I can see the sympathetic looks of the crowd
My eyes close, and I pass out
I’m flying backward
A door bends inward
There’s a deafening sound in my ear
The car is impossible to steer
“Watch out! ” I scream
But my dad did not heed
My cry, he just drove ahead
To the crash that awaited
We were on the way
On the road for the day
Driving to the end of the path
With a weeks worth of luggage in tow
“Are you ready? Let’s go! ”
My dad’s face glowed
As we ran out the door
Hoping excitement was in store
