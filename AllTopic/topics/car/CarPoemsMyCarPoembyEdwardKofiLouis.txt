A fool stole my car and damaged it!
And, when he was caught,
A wise man said he will pay twice as much for my car;
Hoping to repair my care and take care ofthe thief.
Then i said: ' I will give this care for free to the thief'!
The thief then answered: 'Oh! If i knew then that, this care will be mine as a gift, i will not have stolen it in the first place';
However, in this life, 'It is better to ask than, to steal'.
So, i got the value of my car being paid twice as much from the wise man;
And, he took the damaged car and the thief away.
