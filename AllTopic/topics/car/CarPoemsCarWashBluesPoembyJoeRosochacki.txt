Well, I should be sittin in an air conditioned office in a swivel chair
Talkin some trash to the secretaries
Sayin, here, now mama, come on over here.
Come summer the work gets kind a hard
This ain't no place to be if ya planned on being a star.
Let me tell you it's always cool
And the boss don't mind sometimes if ya act a fool.
Did a dentist named Dr. George Trusty could have done it?
Did dentist don the disco dance that put Brandy Fanning singin’ the blues?
Did the dentist know what has he done, his moves of body that do not quite fit,
His moves that would jeopardize his patients health as I heard today on the news?
Croce wouldn’t have done this, neither Rose Royce,
Kickin’ their songs about car washes,
But Trusty knew he had choice,
About doctoring the person in his chair,
About being serious, when you drill in to their mouth,
It is though he couldn’t care,
About his dentistry, may all his patient, beware.
He cracked a bit in nasal cavity,
He told her to sneeze,
He said something gone wrong,
She should blow out with ease.
NOT! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
It not snot! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
May Brandy get more than 600k that is hers rightly so,
May you not have a dentist tell “It’s going to be alright if you blow”.
