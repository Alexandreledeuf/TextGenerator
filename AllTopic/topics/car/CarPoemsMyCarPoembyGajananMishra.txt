Here is my car
The driver sits in the car
And moves as he desires.
My body is a car
The car-body is moving
By the control of material nature.
My body is a railway train
The railway train-body is moving
Under the direction of the controller.
But I am a spiritual spark
Part and parcel of You, my dear
It is Your kindness that I am here.
