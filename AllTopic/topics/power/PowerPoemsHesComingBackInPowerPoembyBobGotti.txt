Jesus is coming to set all straight and you may have no time to wait.
For no one knows the day or hour when He’ll return in all His Power.
And every eye will see that day when all His power He does display.
The power He set aside for me when He chose to die upon that tree.
He had the power to save His life but He chose to be our sacrifice.
But unlike a sacrifice that lay dead, The Lord my friend rose again.
And in the view of many men, back up to Heaven Christ did ascend.
As they looked intently in the sky, they may have asked how and why.
Then two angels appeared on the way with the following words to say,
This same Jesus that did ascend is coming back the same way again.
From this you and I should learn we should be looking for His return.
To believers Christ sent His Power to teach about that awesome hour,
Although Christ died, He rose again, to become the Savior of all men.
The power He could have used was a power that He could not lose.
Jesus Christ set aside His Majesty, but as God, retained His Deity.
He will return in Total Majesty and again, every single eye will see.
Many on that day will perish refusing to embrace The Lord we cherish,
As Christ destroys the man of sin, with the brightness of His coming.
While men who wait in every nation, to them He brings His Salvation.
It may be today or tomorrow, so embrace Him now and have no sorrow.
