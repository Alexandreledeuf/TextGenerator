A Word is capable of anything
It is capable of changing enemies
into friends.
It is capable of penetrating
the impenetrable.
It is capable of changing the impossibility
into possibilities.
It is capable of uniting man and woman into
husband and wife.
It is capable of changing the Atheist into
Christian.
It is capable of changing illiterate into
professional.
It is capable of changing political crisis into
independence.
Beginning today let us not just utter words
but live by them, let your words be sweet and
caring to  all those around you.
Because we never know how far reaching
something we may think, say or do today
will affect the lives of millions tomorrow.
