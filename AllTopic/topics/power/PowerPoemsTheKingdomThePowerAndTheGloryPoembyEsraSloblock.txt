When you look at your life
With your trophy wife
Do you feel fulfilled?
In your comfort zone
Are you bored to the bone?
Has your spirit been killed?
Do you dance in the rain?
Do you feel the pain
That makes you know you're alive?
All things work to a plan
You're a corporate man
For wealth and power you strive.
Your materialist god
Has an iron ruling rod
No room for free thought.
In the Brave New World
Your flag is unfurled
Your status you've bought.
All the things that you've promised
Have you really been honest?
People's lives are your tools.
And when you are wrong
You then sing a new song
I think 'Who are the fools? '
Have you ever been loved?
Is your handshake steel gloved?
Can you really unwind?
Have you drank to excess?
Is your true happiness
In your business like mind?
A blip in the market
Turns your mood very dark, it
Puts your nose out of joint.
Who do you want to be?
All the best things are free
You're missing the point.
