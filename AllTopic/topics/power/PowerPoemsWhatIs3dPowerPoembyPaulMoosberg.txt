V-8 engines pushing tin
Up and down to run and win
Circled race yet powers in
Belt and shaft in 2-d spin
Fins of fans are ran to pound
Wind with fin to spin around
Blowing gusts at me I found
2-d borders power bound
Atoms bound to different blight
Breaking in from left to right
Up and down from any sight
Front to back the powers fight
This would seem to beam the way
How power rolls in wild stray
So why do we confine its day
To running in this 2-d way?
