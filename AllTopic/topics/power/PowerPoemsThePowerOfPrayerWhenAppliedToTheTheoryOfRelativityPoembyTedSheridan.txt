The old man had been channeling Albert for days
He had managed to make contact with him
while taking his morning constitution in the back
behind his custom built plywood paneled trailer
His wife's (actually his cousin's)  garden was doing extremely well
The sweet corn was high and the beans were really coming in...
The old guy had been unable to sleep for weeks up till then
This one burning question kept eating at his psychic
and the old man thought only an Einstein would know
If when in a person's life there is a spiritual void
Will Evil then be all which can fill his heart?
Or was there power enough in prayer to save him?
The answer came as a shocker....
When Albert who had taken the liberty of enlisting some help
from six of the twelve Apostles...
Spoke to him late last night....The old man was
taking a piss on the rhubarb and collard greens
He claims it keeps the varmints from eating them greens
'Old man' the voices of the combined seven called....
Bartholomew acting as spokesperson for the group....
Said....
'Two protons stuck together have less mass than two single separate protons'
Perplexed the old guy scratched his head with his free hand and asked,
'What does this mean to me?
To which there was only the sound of dead silence
and that of his stream hitting the broad leaf of the rhubarb....
