Where the world goes
Where the power goes
Power the great power
Makes the powered arrogant.
Power can make wonders
Ruling power so mighty
Where people are subjects
Submissive they try to achieve
Humans challenges the power
Absolute power of autocracy
Opts for people's power
where people's will triumphs
Emperors lost, kingdoms gone
Collective will beautiful ever
Collective power always nice
Power the great power
World goes with power and problems.
