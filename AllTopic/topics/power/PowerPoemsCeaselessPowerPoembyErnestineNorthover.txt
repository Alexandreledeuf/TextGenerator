The sea invades the coastal cliffs,
Battling against its stalwart stone,
Devouring its surface bit by bit,
And leaving it gullible and prone.
The rocks hit back with warlike will,
Facing the churning water's rage,
With ceaseless power, the ocean spars,
And tries, at all times to upstage.
So firm and strong the crags were formed,
And tough and sheer its rock face stands,
But slow erosion there will always be,
As the bluff gives way to the deep's demands.
