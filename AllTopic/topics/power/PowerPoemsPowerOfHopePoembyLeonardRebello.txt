Looking into the distant future
something my stupid past didn’t see.
May the outcome of my experience
allow God to transform me
I Long to be alive
for within I was dead.
Darkness emptiness was my company
and each day I dread.
Walking with a long lost soul
Understanding nothing at hand
I once had a goal
my dreams turned to sand.
I seek the face of soothing comfort
to captivate my vast distressed mind.
I can’t give up on this beautiful life
Hope, I must find.
Thank God I found hope
In the midst of this eerie dark
Pursuing, struggling to find some light
until it penetrates right through my heart.'
