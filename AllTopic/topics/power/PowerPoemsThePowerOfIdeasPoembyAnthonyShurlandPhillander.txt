That they are more precious than diamonds
Ideas which may seem insignificant
Has tremendous power within them

Of all invention and everything which
Is created by humankind

They have got the power to move mountains
To overcome any obstacle and to make
The seemingly impossible possible
Ideas are the levers which moves and the axis
On which the world revolves
The power of ideas are immeasurable
The power of ideas...
