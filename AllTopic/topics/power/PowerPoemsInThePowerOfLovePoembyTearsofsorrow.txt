There cames a time
When you face the tougest of figths
Seaching for a light
I'm lost in the darkest of nights
The wind blows so cold
I'm standing alone
Befor the battles begun
But deep in my soul
The future unfolds
Is bight as the rays of the sun
You got to believe in the power of love
There's a light that falls from the heart
It's a chian reaction
There's nothing that will keep us apart
Stand by my side
There's nothing to hide
Together, we will fight to the end
Take hold of my hand
And you will understand
What means to be friends
You got to believe in the power of love
It's what hearts are mabe of
