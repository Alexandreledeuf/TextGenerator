I must love her more than she does,
The husband wants.
I must love him more than he does,
The wife wants.
This is power of love
I must hold her more than she does,
The husband intends.
I must hold him more than he does,
The wife intends.
This is love of power.
Power of love is breeze.
Love of power is storm
