How change of chairs makes human beings queer!
That power corrupts minds is truly true;
No lion can ever become a deer;
Nor can any elephant like cows moo.
How men in power behave so different!
Power alone cannot command respect;
How men settle old scores with mind so bent!
The Power-Bug can any man infect.
And very soon misuse of power begins,
The man his doom in much unconceived of ways;
Unless level-headed, be they earthlings,
Prematurely, ill-fated end their days.
The humble man in power stays for long,
Desisting all his life from doing wrong.
