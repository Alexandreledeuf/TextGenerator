I am beyond the help of prayer...I am in the abyss of a double life
One which I brought upon myself and another Fate has dealt me
I was preyed upon and cast into the belly of the Beast
Its lies and deceit washed me in a digestive saliva
Breaking down all of my defenses and leaving me ready
To become nothing more than excrement...
Prayers can't help that kind of shit....
