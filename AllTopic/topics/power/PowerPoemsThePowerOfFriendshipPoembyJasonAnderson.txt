Pain is the feeling you endure when you are alone,
It is great torture when you have no friends at all
Pain is the feeling you endure when you break a bone,
You endure great humiliation and pain when you slip and fall
However, you possess the spirit to get back on your feet,
Even if the path in front of you becomes too rough
There will be friends along the path that you will meet,
That will help make you become strong and tough
Also, they will help cure you when you are sick,
They will be friends with you through thick and thin
And they will never think about playing a mean joke nor trick,
Your friends will be as close to you as your own kin
Now I know I cannot quit during the fight,
Because I know my friends will help me see the light.
