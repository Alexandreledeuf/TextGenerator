U Fooled me
U Cheated on me
U let me go
U made me cry
U forced me to believe your lies
U tried to control me
U betrayed me
U did not love me
U never knew me
U never understood me
even you have never ever  tried
Finally, simply u left me
But now all I can say is
I love you
because this is something I have no power upon to
and I just cannot stop thinking about you
because this is not something I usually do
