come
lets kiss and rejoice
you..
in my ingenuity,
and me,
in your feeble ability
to forgive
such deviltry,
as
mine
come
lets play blindfolded
you..
will still envision joy
and me apathetic,
oblivious
to the  tears
turning red
blood
as wine
come
lets wear deaf plugs
you..
can then sing along
with my loud booming
rythym..all the while
as the moans of
tattered,
torn,
children..
................die.
just sad...
marriot; islamabad; pakistan..the question is no longer why.
