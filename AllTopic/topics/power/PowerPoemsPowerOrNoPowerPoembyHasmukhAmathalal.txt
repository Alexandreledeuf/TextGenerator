Power or no power

Power or no power
Your words carry it further
Your image, in public eyes, gets it stronger
You become recognized and acceptable figure
You damage your own personality
And get nowhere to the reality
Your artificial leanings worsens the image
No one takes you seriously in terms of critical phase
The dynasty rule goes in your disfavor
Your public utterances don't earn you any favor
Your party line in terms of policy matters
Creates you as an unimpressive figure
To take help from like-minded parties is alright
But to cash on unholy lines makes your position not right
You are guided by people who are causing your fall
Create sagging image and no one responds to call
It is clear from your move
In any way, it will not improve your position
The party may gown further
You shall be seen nowhere
The regional parties have their own agenda
They have only one plea
Remove the B.J.P from power
They want to use you as cover
They have no intention to accept you as leader
It will get harder and harder
You shall be compelled to comprise
And accept their man as a leader with promises
