When the rain falls from the sky above,
It is God showering you with tears of love.
When the sun shines on a  bright sunny day.
God’s angels are coming your way.
When the wind blows, and the trees sway.
God speaks and has much to say.
When the snowflakes fall and glisten.
God whispers, we must listen.
When the earth trembles and opens to swallow.
God tells us, there may be no tomorrow.
When the sea lifts and the waters tower.
God warns all of his great power.
When the sounds of thunder are heard.
God insists we follow his word.
When the funnel winds shatter our existence
God gives us tremendous resistence.
When we witness the forces of nature.
There is no doubt of it’s creator.
God reigns in heaven and rules the earth.
We shall remain in awe, of his worth.
