In silence the flower buds gently bloom,
In silence they waft their sweet perfume.
In silence grows the blades of grass,
In silence I pen down my verse.
Speech is silver, silence gold,
Good deeds silently performed,
Is more eloquent than  words!
In silence lovers cuddle and sleep,
True love communicates through
oceans deep!
Look at the mountains towering so high,
Clouds kiss their tops and silently
float by!
In silence the monks move  their  prayer
beads,
In silence  they perform their charitable deeds.
In silence  the  sun  rises and shine,
In silence the moon beams softly  smiles.
In silence my God I invoke,
In silence rise my incense  smoke.
In silence my inner-self  unfolds,
In silent prayer my hands  I  fold.
In silence, with Him I communicate,
In silence I surrender to my fate.
In silence I beg Him to make me whole,
In silence to Him I surrender my soul!
In our noise polluted world, silence is
difficult to find,
But I know, one day, this Silence  shall be
mine!
