Seeking the healing power of sleep,
I find no respite in my dreams...
Sinking into slumber deep,
It's not so restful as it seems.
Agony's relived time and again,
Magnified by the helplessness
I feel in my dreams and then
I mourn lost love and happiness
I find more relief in time than sleep,
Although I still relive my loss,
I feel the pain less acutely,
Still there, but not as it once was.
