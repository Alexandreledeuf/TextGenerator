Power is love and strength
Showered on others at any length
Power is a woman
Standing delicately like a flower
Power is intelligence
Without pretence that is so intense
Power is knowledge
We all acknowledge
As politicians take the oath and pledge
Along comes the usual greed
With the desire to feed
On weaknesses with speed
So careful, take heed!
Before you dry up and bleed
Power knows no friends
Powers shows and sends
A message of uneven ends
Power is spoken words
When battles and wars are won
Without the need of the gun
Power is the human touch
That soothes the heart so much
While we observe, stand and watch
But on the whole
Power is control
Its one and only ultimate goal!
