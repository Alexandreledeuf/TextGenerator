Litter of puppies
Glitters the garden.
Slither and snuggled
The warm protective body.
Sucking in, the warm nector
Oozing out, just for them.
Eyes were still shut
Could see and sense
The air of comfort.
Somehow, knew – The Predators
Are not to be worried
Mother’s eye was always on them
No matter where they withered.
Growing up with
The Power of A Mother!
