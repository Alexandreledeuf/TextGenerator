One second might not tell
When held against an hour
One hour might not count
When weighed against a day
One day may not matter
When considering a life
One word may mean little
From the conversation whole
One line may not be missed
When stricken from the book
One thought may be dismissed
In comprehension of the mind
One flaw might be overlooked
When evaluating character
One mistake means little
When summing up a man
One sin may be forgiven
In the judgement of a soul
So how is it a single glance
Can make one wither so?
