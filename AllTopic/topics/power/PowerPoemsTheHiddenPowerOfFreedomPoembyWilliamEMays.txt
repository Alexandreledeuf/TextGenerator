To have the right to dream
and to follow it each day
until some tiny part of it
is you in every way
gives zest to all of living
and lets you dream some more
'til at last you are near heaven's gate
as your thoughts lift up and soar.
This, then, the freedom that I seek
for you and all mankind
the spark of real achievement
capturing heart and soul and mind.
To strike off lingering chains of doubt
look out on a new day
where freedom holds you to a task
that asks your best in every way.
