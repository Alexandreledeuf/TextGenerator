You-
Stand by the ocean, shouting, trying to
drown out the cry of the waves
with your voice.
Neptune, god of the sea, powerful while powerless,
in your human psychology
promises you your failure.
You-
Throw yourself to the waves, let go
of all you hold to be true,
find yourself floating.
Power in the waves, in the sun beating down, in the
wind whipping along the shore,
throwing sand like a child throwing a tantrum.
You-
Leave the shore, laughing at jokes
of no importance, leaving behind
a place of power.
