When a tiny melody catches your breath
And wonderful lyrics impound your brain
The clarity of a voice stirs your heart
You know you've finally come home
A climbing spirit bursts through the clouds
Sharing emotions without constraint
Turning the key that opens the chambers
Making you believe again
The combination touches your soul
You feel, you explode, you're soaring high
How does this wonderful journey
Affect you so, make you live?
A rare gift stirs the senses so absolutely
A beautiful breeze to make you fly
This my friends is how it feels
It always amazes me, this ride
