I happen to be terrified
By cut-throat competition
And sinister backroom deals
Rendering all treasures and rewards
To the obscenely decadent and rich
While the land I love
Descends into a trash heap
Where the poor and dispossessed must weep.
.
There has to be revolution
And the turning of everything
Upside down!
The politics of cruelty
Must be supplanted by compassion,
There must be an underground reaction
To the overt violence and greed
Of those in devastating power
Who currently hold the keys in this dark hour
To the prison cell of this existence.
