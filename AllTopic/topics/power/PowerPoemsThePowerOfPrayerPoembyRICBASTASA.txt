You pray a lot and take pride
That your prayers are granted
And you pray some more
Like a monk like a priest,
Sometimes I think about
Prayerful dogs, what if their
Prayers are granted too
Bones and more bones
Would surely rain from
The heavenly skies.
Oh yes, I pray, but if my
Prayers are not granted,
I still know that God loves me
He thinks my wants are not the best
For me, and he reserves the rest.
That really suits me best.
