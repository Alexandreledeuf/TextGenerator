I drank and feasted on the table of love
They laughed, cried and shared
They stood in unity and cared
Behold a new baby was born
Into a world of love
Together the moved mountains
Together they frooze fountains
to build bridges of support
Behold I was mesmerised by its power
To which I was no unfamiliar stranger
Together the vigorously fought
for peace and freedom
Together they sang the song of
Love, love, love
The amount of energy in one space
I could not possibly put a finger on to trace
But it held the ultimate power to light up my face
There is nothing more powerful than
Love, love, love
