The power of truth is in the belief
The power of love in the heart
The power of faith is felt in the mind
With every member of your being a part
Yet the power of change is hard to adjust
Because temptation is so hopelessly strong
While the power of right is substantially hard
You must overcome the power of wrong
But the power in you is much greater than all
In you, his power is born
So when the unfairness of life takes your power away
Remember to whom the power belongs...
