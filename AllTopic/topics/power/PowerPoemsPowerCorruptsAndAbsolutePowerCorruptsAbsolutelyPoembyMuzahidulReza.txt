Once in jungle a rat was very frightened by a cat
Somehow it escaped from the attack,
There the rat met a Saint and prayed
To be a large cat,
So, it was turned into a cat
And it began to kill rats,
But dogs often used to chase it,
Being unhappy it prayed to be a mighty dog,
So it was then turned into a big dog
And it began to torture the cats,
But tigers began to chase it
So, again it prayed to be a tiger,
Finally the Saint turned it into a tiger,
This tiger began to feel very mighty
That made it so proud of power,
Ill thoughts entered its brain heavily
It planned to attack and kill the Saint;
Some evidences made the Saint understand
Instantly he turned it into the pre-rat.
