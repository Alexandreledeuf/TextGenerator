Tell me:
What came first
Easter or the egg?
Crucifixion
&n bsp;    or daffodils?
Three days in a tomb
;  or four days
in Paris?

Bank Holiday Monday).
When is a door
not a door?
When it is rolled away.
When is a body
not a body?
When it is a risen.
Question.
Why was it the Saviour rode on the cross?
Answer.
To get us
to the other side.
Behold I stand.
Behold I stand and what?
Behold I stand at the door and
knock knock.
