Life is meant to live in the ''moment'',
tomorrow will arrive if tomorrow should,
yesterday are moments lost in real time.
Memories are images for Life's fortress,
re-runs from times non-negotiable motion,
running fast, and never looking back.
Carpe-diem, a mantra so despised by they-
who prioritize possessions over providence,
and mock the Kind in Heart as ignorants.
Life, in the scope of length and worth-
nary be measured...by guess or presage;
all we have is all that's meant to be,
in moments to cherish till death be ours.
