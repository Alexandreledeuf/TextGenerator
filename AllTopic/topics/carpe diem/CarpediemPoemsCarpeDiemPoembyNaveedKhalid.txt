That red carpet half-way between
my lip and desire,
a bunch of stars at e'ery step of the way
to collect by the sea ashore;
of laurel wreath thy myrtle crown
that crow's quill beside,
of plumed hat on knees in ruffled feathers,
a phantom of chalice wings
under the canopy of a hut:
this world in thy presence alone
to a land of fairies abides,
along the pavement of cow parsley;
a foul fawning bay at my door
of unnerved blood in vein,
oft bewails the night through hurtlings of past woe:
e'ery flower upon a barren heath of ages that are dead
from out of the blues in still waters,
agoing, agoing to that day of unaltered eye,
thy gilded monument astounds in modern electra.
