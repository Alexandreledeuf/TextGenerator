Here, my heart is for you to see,
My soul is for you to burn,
Til no one can catch me,
Even the world stop to turn.
My Love, My lips is for you to kiss inside darkness,
And I will wait you for thousands of sadness,
Come and hold me, i'm your sweetness,
Here i sing for you and your happiness,
For you, i can die;
I swear, i will not lie;
Bring my soul where ever you go,
For my love, i can't say no.
