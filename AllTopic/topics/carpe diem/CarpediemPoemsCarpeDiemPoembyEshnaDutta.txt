Go on and forth,  seize the day.
When the tongue is afraid to say.
At that time to take an extra mile,
Let yourself out,  for that little while.
There's no harm in taking a leap downward, .
When it acts as your force to go on, forward.
When the world is trying to pull you down,
Be oblivion,  cause it's the fight for the crown.
The crown,  carved for the greatest glory.
When you get there, writing your own heroic story,
You will be the pronounced winner of the game called life,
As,  to get there, you have fought the battle,  to end the deadliest strife.
And that day,  you shall be called the true winner,
For truly interpreting the words of the leader.
And, so,  shall the honor of the greatest never fade away,
As all shall hail,  Carpe Diem, Seize the day! !
