Seize the moment when the sun shines,
When people ccan only think of happy times.
Birds are singing,
Babies laughing,
Everythings calm and stays in line.
Cherish this moment, fore when it ends,
The world is broken and filled with sin.
People dying,
Babies crying.
The war continues and there's pain again.
