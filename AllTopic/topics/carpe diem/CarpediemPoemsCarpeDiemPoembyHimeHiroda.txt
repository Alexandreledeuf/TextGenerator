Ephemeral eyes of the Eternal soul
Never cease to seek that goal
Whether it be on Mount Olympus' zenith
Or in the depths of Hades' lair just beyond the river Styx.
How could it, something momentary
Strive for something that's wanted by so many?
How could I reach that lofty peak
Without performing an impossible feat?
I guess it all ends in faith, belief in the absurd
I think I just have to want it bad enough
To make the whole cosmos revolve
And make me realize, do what I Could.
