Life is a grab bag,
Never asks that it be fair.
There are no guarantees
anywhere.
Plus and minus, a measure
of talent
And perhaps you make it
on balance.
As for the good life
syndrome,
You lose some; you win some.
Life is a grab bag
No refund, no exchange,
Just a self limited range.
Born into a time a place,
You consume time, expand
space,
Grabbing all you can
of life's repast.
Carpe Diem while the
daylight lasts.
