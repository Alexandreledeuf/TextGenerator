itâ€™s that
sweat soaked
moment
gripped in
the firm fist
of apprehension
when everything
seems equally
insignificant
except for the
heart in her chest
that moves you
in torrents
and
that burning heart
in your chest that
has finally finished
convalescing
and is ready
to be conquered
again
