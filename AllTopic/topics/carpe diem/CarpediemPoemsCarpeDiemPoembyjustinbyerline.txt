when you spend your life fearing death
you'll spend your death hating life
carpe diem
drunk and alone
puts me in a zone
story of my life
being born
bordem
complication growing
medication
mutilation
marijuana< br>long rides in a worn out car
not knowing where you are
confusion
love
hate
finding my gate
traveling
welcome home... get out of my house
trailer park fun
waiting for the sun
debts and bets
walking the line
insanity is yours
but freedom is mine
