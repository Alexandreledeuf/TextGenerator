Having a night without sleep.
What a day, I cannot think right.
I need to boost some thoughts and clear my mind with a cuppa.
Another precious day wasted.
Sleeplessness is such a threat.
I know, not much left.
I try to recall that Carpe diem philosophy.
I must walk around the rose garden again.
Imagine a must, lying down under the gentle moon on the softest grasses.
Get away.
Now I 've got it.
I must sit down and write.
I must be away and free.
