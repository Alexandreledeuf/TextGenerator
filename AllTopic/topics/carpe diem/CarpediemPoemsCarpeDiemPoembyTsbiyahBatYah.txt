Clock strikes 12.
There is no past nor future only the present.
The precious minutes we’ve wasted we can’t get back.
But knowing that I wasted them with you, keeps me here.
Stops time and sticks us together, frozen.
A picture.
A memory.
And you melt into me like candle wax until we can no longer determine where I end and you begin.
But I know that TIME begins and ends inside of you.
When I’m with you I forget about time but years from now I’ll sit back and say 'DO YOU REMEMBER THE TIME, WHEN WE... FELL IN LOVE? '
In fraction of second you consecrate me.
I want you to wake up in the morning right next to me.
It feels like there’s not enough time in the day, though of it we have plenty.
And when I don’t have the time I make it for you.
Every single appointment.
Even when I’m early its too late.
On my calendar your epoch is special event. My time I’ll take it for you.
As short as the time we’ve shared it’s cherished like eternity.
You are the era of horology.
The time flies when we’re having fun but it feels like an eon.
In a matter of days you give me countless infinities.
I will never miss you because of what we do but what we are together.
You gave me the time of day, way past due. The timing is right, and that’s my cue.
On my clock you are the TICK and the TOCK.
And yes there were other times but this time it's you.
All the TIME.
And all we have is right NOW!
