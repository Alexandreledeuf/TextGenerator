Useless ash upon the hearth
That looks out on my soul.
The life, the light, the cheery warmth,
Expires and now lays cold.
That pleasant snap, that glowing flame,
Passed warmth to reverie.
And though my life may seem the same,
Itâ€™s not the same to me.
The flame is gone, the fuel is spent,
As embers fade away.
We sadly wonder where it went,
Our youth and blissful days.
