Carpe Diem
Sunrise, Carpe Diem, seize the day
Life is like a play, so find your way
An infinite maze this reality seems to be
Locked up in your mind, warden you have the key
Fly high in the sky, free as a bird
Life is what you make it, have you heard
Open your ears open your eyes, blinded by the light
Know yourself and rise to a much greater height
Raise the bar, We are cheering you on
Someday both you and I will be gone
Maybe death is an illusion and we'll still be here
Hold your loved ones and friends ever so near
You never know when they'll have to go
Part of this awesome infinite show
So just play your role and play your role well good human
Create as you go, this is your divine plan
You're the artist do you understand
Forward thinking, what do you have planned
Just learn to enjoy yourself today, words of wisdom
Like basic math, add the numbers, what's the sum?
Counting numbers till the end of time
Keep counting till you hear the clock chime
Time a tool for reality, what is your goal?
In this life you must experience depth of soul.
Around we go, The lord of the ring
Flower of life, All of the birds sing
Like our great sun, circling our serene planet Earth
Watching the sunset will help you find your worth
