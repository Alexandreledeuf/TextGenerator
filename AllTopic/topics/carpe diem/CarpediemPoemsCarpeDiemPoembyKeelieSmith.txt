As we live, day by day
Our hopes, our dream’s slip away,
Why not seize the day?
And say goodbye to yesterday,
Grab hold its time to fly!
Take your dreams and let them shine
“So take too many pictures,
Laugh too much,
Forgive freely and love like you’ve never been hurt”
There is only so much time,
To say what needs to be said,
But you don’t have forever
No matter how much you may pray
So live every moment of this day,
Say goodbye to your lifelong fears
“Because every second you spend angry,
Or upset is a moment of happiness you can never get back”
So live with no excuses,
And love with no regrets
Just do what your heart says.
Its carpe deim baby
Why not give it a try?
