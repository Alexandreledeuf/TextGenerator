To those who sing carpe diem everyday
I hope they would live long to unprove carpe diem or life of a lizard
I hope they would smell flowers, big and rosy one
lotuses too.
To some who sing carpe diem all the time
I hope they will forget to sing and by God's grace live on to ninety ormore, with vigor and good health.
To those who are dogged by carpe diem all the time, I hope they will forget one day about carpe diem and live on, free
knowing life, knowing more and wise.
I pray God blesses them with accomplishments.
This is life!
