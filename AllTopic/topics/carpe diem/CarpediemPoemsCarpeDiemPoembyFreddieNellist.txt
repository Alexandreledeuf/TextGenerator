Time no longer recalls past dreams
Now all memories in purple hazes
Time continues in it's chosen way
A crystal ball won't turn the pages.
Comfort empty spaces in your heart
Time does not' wait, seize the chance
Golden opportunity will wait for none
Life's journey can be a merry dance.
The time to do and be is always now
Let fate decide be it north or south
Regard the future with anticipation
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
Be swayed not by the highest bidder
On your life's trek, long or short
You'll find chances flowing at random
Carpe diem success can't be bought.
Don't dwell in shadows of discontent
Dreams come true to those that will
Questions asked should be answered
Yours will be if you climb that hill.
