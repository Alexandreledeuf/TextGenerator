The cool breeze of the dawn
with the slim sunlight,
Followed by the glaring sunshine
the chirping of birds, the song of cuckoo,
What a fresh morning sight to view!
The silent afternoon,
The calm warm air,
The noise of the swaying leaves
A subtle song heard from a far off place
What a peaceful noon away from the usual rat race!
Seated by the seashore
The sight of the fishing boats and ships in the middle of the sea
The waves trying to get on the land, retrace and come again
The sea shells coming along with the water to the shore
Worth an evening to adore!
A gaze at the night sky
The crescent moon
The twinkling stars
If a shooting star also gives way
What a pleasant sight to end the day!
I would long to have a day like this
The soft haze of a spring day
The red fire on a long winters evening
To submerge in this dream land
For a day be freed from the routine errand!
So Come, Lets sing our songs
Dream our dreams
Hope our hope and
Pray our prayer
with a sense of Carpe Diem.
