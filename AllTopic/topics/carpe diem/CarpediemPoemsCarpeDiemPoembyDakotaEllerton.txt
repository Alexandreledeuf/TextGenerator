The first night, the best night,
you had me at hello.
We went to your room,
and it was like I'd been there before.
My heart raced, my smile glowed.
We pulled out the cards,
and opened a beer.
Strip poker was not my strength.
Behind a pillow I hid,
behind my wall.
Your lips, my lips,
touched, my heart raced, beating louder then a drum.
I wanted your hands on me,
my hands on you.
We layed on your bed,
and talked long into the morning.
Our bodies embracing,
rubbing.
We didn't need sex,
to enjoy ourselves.
You sparked my heart strings that night,
my walls shifted.
Each time, everytime,
they come down a little more.
Yours are high,
but crumbling along side mine.
Don't let go my friend.
You and I are quite the pair, you know.
I would not shower with just anyone,
nor would I whisper my sweet nothings.
The things I do with you,
I hardly ever share.
If I was willing to try, are you?
If i put my heart on my sleeve,
would you take care?
How am I to believe you, how am I to love you,
and not think you'll be the same, as my first love?
My first love, my hardest love,
my deepest love.
I've never felt such pain,
I could not bare another such as that.
But for you, I'd be willing to try.
Do you believe me when I say, I care for you?
I do.
More then anything, I want to love you,
I want to be there for you.
Can I have your heart?
Share your thoughts with me.
My hearts racing,
Carpe Diem.
