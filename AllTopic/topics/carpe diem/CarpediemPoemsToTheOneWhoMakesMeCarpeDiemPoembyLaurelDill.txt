Now I have to cope
With all of this
And i´m losing hope
on the one I miss
He must not know
so I´ll go with the flow
they must not notice
that I´m feeling like this
´cause I want to forget it all
and wait for my curtain call
but she comes into scene
and takes my spotlight
with 'no intentions mean'
like 'it´s all right'
but i won´t buy it,
So here comes Pete
who says, 'love the brotherhood'
so, I bought her food.
But, ah! it makes me sick
to see this freak
all around him
preaching so rich
´bout high esteem
when she can´t reach
the least of it
He is her ticket in
to the high seam,
he´s the prize to win,
to get out of her ruin;
and she doesn´t dare
doesn´t have the nerve
to confess in my face
she got us into a maze
And so nice with her lace
puts on her show
but when i come,
apparently the foe
was just with her mum,
and took off the paw.
Now I wonder:
where he stands?
will he go yonder
into this sinking sands?
I know  they will lead him
away from his dream
´cause we broke up
so we could go higher
we ended it up
to be even wiser
Don´t want him to fall
want him to follow his call
God please let him be
the best he can be
´cause this crazy girl
and her never-grown mum
want to posses the pearl
to the cost of some rum
And this heart still aches
my blood fills the lakes
rivers, and the seas
But he doesn´t notice
doesn´t see the red in water
So this people walk by
and I say, oh my!
I´ll give it a try
I´ll open myself up
But they believe
they´re on top
who could relieve
such a behaviour?
Just do me a favor
Stop saying
You´re something
you´ll never be
I just make this plea
don´t accept me
don´t understand me
just be yourself
and don´t put people on a shelf
you can puke on me
but don´t dare pretend
you´re a honey bee
´cause this signs you send
make me puke
and the shot you took
will make you suffer
´cause you got nothing to offer
and you´ll be cryin'
when you see me flyin'
This is gonna be fun
since you´re only a pawn
who was feeling bad and sad
while I was playing with the lad
I really don´t care
and I know it´s not fair
but how can I help it?
You´re the perfect target
you gave me the weapon
so this game is on
This is so much fun!
You´re the little pawn
and I´m on the throne!
So off with your head
I´ll fight and defend
Yeah, that´s what I said!
he´ll reach his best
without your fest
So now it´s over
no need for cover
you´ve given me peace
and this, this is
what I need:
be close to you
like when I was a kid
no longer blue
not needing to hide,
just standing by your side.
