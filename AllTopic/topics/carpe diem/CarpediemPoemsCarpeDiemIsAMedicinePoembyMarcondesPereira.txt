Apollo plays his golden flute,
While children play in the trees, and we celebrate nature.
While children play in the trees, and we love every creature.
Here 'Carpe Diem' is the law, here 'Carpe Diem' is absolute.
A toast to us! Today is all that we have.
A toast to us! Human life is a fragile noon.
A toast to us! We will die soon.
A toast to us! From eternity we're save.
Apollo plays a sad serenade
Finally, eternal sleep came
There is no one to blame,
'Cause our lives shine and now they fade!
