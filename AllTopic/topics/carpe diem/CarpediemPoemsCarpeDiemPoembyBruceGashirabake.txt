Yesterday is missing,
Like a lost treasure in a city,
The dancefloor I tread in a pity.
Forgetting that I am in Philly,
My thoughts wander in a beating,
Time passes and it is but fleeting,
But still, yesterday is missing.
This life has become a blur,
Remind me, did I not come from far?
Wasn't yesterday to my life a support bar?
I feel lost, my mind tossed, like a deluded sir.
My life wagon forgot where it has come from so far,
Who I was, today tries but to mar,
Everything said to me now will be a slur.
Should I think of it as for the best?
Perfection is what my life has had as quest.
Stranded in who I am, should I think of this as a test?
Or should I fight from this trough to the crest?
My east is lost; how should I find my west?
I am being told my present I should not detest,
And while I think I can, I still think it not the best
A fly passes by and its minuteness I see,
To me it speaks of how to be,
"My dear to your status I advise you cling,
Before long, riddled your shape will seem,
Ductility soon your bones will feel,
And yesterday not being here will not like a worry,
But here is today and now, you are in it.
