When you feel old and notice the luster of youth lacks sparkle, don't worry be happy.
Seize the moment and take pride that aging is rewarded with wisdom which the young ones will achieve many years far away;
When you failed to achieve something you thought was designed for you, do not regret or be weary. Destiny had align you for what you are today, seize the moment and shout
victory;
When you drop or forget your shopping list, do not attempt to make another one. Seize the moment and enjoy a shopping spree once in a blue moon while you can;
When you think you are strange or eccentric person, do not feel outcast. There are
millions of us with oddity who are kind hearted free spirited Homo Sapiens. Seize the moment and wear your crown as King or Queen of Oddballs Par Excecellence;
CARPE DIEM, Seize the moment whatever life confronts you. For this moment is like a river you can never step twice. Treat your moments like a poetry in motion where into the depthness of your heart and soul, you and only you, can decipher the meaning behind the rhymes and rhythm.
