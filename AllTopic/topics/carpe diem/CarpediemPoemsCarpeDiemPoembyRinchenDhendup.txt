Upon hearing the Nature's frequent call,
I went to attend the glory of nearby Spectacular Fall.
Away from the mundane and factitious world of living,
In the heart of the nature so replenishing.
There from a height water took its steep down pour,
So natural and captivating  cascade it wore.
Soothing rhythms welcomed me unlike it's summer growl,
With mildness to make me count it wasn't playing a foul.
Right in the midst of the fall a Rainbow rose,
Bestowing me  an ideal  setting for a pose,
Carpe Diem! Right then and there seized my day,
To drop few lines of  my living to portray.
