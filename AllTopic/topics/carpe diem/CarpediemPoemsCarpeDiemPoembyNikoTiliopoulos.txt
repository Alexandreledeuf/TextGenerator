A certain formula on Carpe Diem’s site
gives some swain people a fright,
with its might and frank right
and wrongs, it seems it belongs
to the realm of erroneous thoughts,
false like a healthy day’s snorts
it haunts its twisted creator, a traitor
of academia, with Mediterranean athymia
and psychophemia, he should be ostracised
to that despised space of disgrace.
But yourselves embrace, for the truth’s far more funny,
cause for love or money the equation was a farce
to parse the shallow minds in their disguise,
to separate the fools from the wise,
and what a surprise that must be
when their plea becomes a meaningless decree
and their ludicrous spree nothing but a hollow prize.
