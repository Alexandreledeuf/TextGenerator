CARPE DIEM
L.E.S - Live Every Second
One life -
Enjoy it or suffer
Destroy it or prosper
Follow your internal passion, live out every second
Swallow your mental prison, love without any dead-end
Treasure what's precious, pressure away what's malicious
Measure your worth, through your eyes
Seek pleasure on earth, know what's true from the lies
Peace, be with, your mind
Release, to its pith, what's keepin' you blind
Forgive your mistakes, sieve away past aches
You are not perfect, yet, you are not a reject
Be positive, estrange hatred from reality
Act causative, be the change in society
Smile, sadness is futile, life goes a long mile
Do not despair, prepare for fear to disappear
Grow old and watch the beauty of life unfold
Live in harmony, communally, maintain autonomy
Control your destiny, write your own history
The world is yours
Carpe Diem, seize the moment.
