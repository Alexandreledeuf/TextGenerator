morrow is a promise
today is here
seize it, seize it, seize it
should I live or hope to live?
every man dies, not everyman lives
in living, we fail to live
nature offers  day
so it's lived, not preserved
oh come dearest chums!
gather moola
this night
every other night, let's
sip jiggles of scotch, fume cigars
pluck damsels
oh come sweetest!
let's cover the skies, oceans too
canoodle come dusk
delay not, our stuff will not endure
embrace morrow's promise
but celebrate now's joy
life well lived is suffice
savour life's minutes
dwell in the moment
NOW is everything
