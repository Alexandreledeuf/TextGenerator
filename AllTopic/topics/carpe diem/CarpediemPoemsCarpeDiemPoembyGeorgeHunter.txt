Get up! , Get up! ,
Outta the old fart sack!
Too long have you been
Lying on your back.
Arise, arise and meet the sun
You lazy stupid son of a gun.
You’ve been loafing there
Four hours or more
No wonder your back
Is getting sore.
Do you want to sleep
Your life away?
Get up, get up,
And greet the day.
No more rolling in the hay
There’s beer to drink
And bills to pay.
Let me take another tack
Drag your ass out of that rack.
Don’t stay there another minute
The day is yours and you can win it.
So up, up, up and carpe some diem
It’s time to cause a bit of mayhem.
Do not linger any more
Time to be up and out the door.
It’s reveille, reveille,
Up all hands!
When you sail to foreign lands
Get on your hocks and grab your socks
Is what they used to say to me
When sailing on the deep blue sea.
But that was in the days of yore
And now I’m beached and on the shore.
And have to make a decent  living
Life can be so unforgiving.
So it’s up, up, up,
And off to work
The daily grind
I dare not shirk
I have to make a lot of money
To buy some nice things for my honey.
Life is such a cruel rat race
It’s hard to keep up with the pace,
Time to set the world on fire
If it’s to greatness you aspire.
Another day, another dollar
Will have to wait
Til I hear you holler,
Get up you lazy Ess Oh Bee
There’s worlds to conquer
Things to see.
But all that stuff won’t go away
That is all I have to say.
It will wait another day.
I’ll just have to flunk this test
So it’s back to bed
To get more rest
So I say, to my great sorrow
Maybe I’ll get up tomorrow
I will not prevaricate
I will just procrastinate
As already it is way too late
So I’ll just lie here, don’t have a doubt
And don’t let the door hit you in the ass
On your way out!
