O beautiful you in garden's heart
From point where tomorrow shall start
Playfully giving and receiving
In all this of going amending
Lasting futures impending
When flowers seeds are reviving
The love that comes into night
And sets out its feelings on flight
Where garden roses are true:
In each their approval and lore -
When love gives to become more
Of all that is to renew
