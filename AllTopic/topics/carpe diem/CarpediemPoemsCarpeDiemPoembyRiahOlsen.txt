The circle of life is like a flower,
like people they live then die by the hour.
Live life, use all your powers,
until there are no more hours.
Life is short and filled with fears,
and there's no need to spend it on tears.
Live life - seize the day,
and most likely your visit on earth will be worth the stay.
