I intend to live out the rest of my days
By rejoicing in every fleeting moment;
By courting love & beauty not dark despair;
By praying that vital gods will bless me.
For I know not the day nor the hour
When death will hover over me and beat
Its terrible wings and it will all end.
In a heartbeat; in the twinkling of an eye.
