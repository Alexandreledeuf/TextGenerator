Come stroll with me to the top of Blue Jay hill
Escort me upon this adventurous journey now
We will waltz on the platform of that ancient mill
Free yourself from the city, I can show you how
I will name a creek and a flower or two just for you
This will be our enchanted land, if only for a day
Rule one in this land is to do as you wish to do
Rule two in the kingdom is to cast your cares away
That burden that you carry simply must be tossed
The weight of pain and regret is too heavy here
We will find ourselves by deliberately getting lost
Use a Sycamore branch to joust away your fears
Greet your first sunrise through your watering eyes
Your warming cheeks caressed by those welcoming rays
Surrender to your passions and you will be surprised
The time is now and not just 'one of these days'.
