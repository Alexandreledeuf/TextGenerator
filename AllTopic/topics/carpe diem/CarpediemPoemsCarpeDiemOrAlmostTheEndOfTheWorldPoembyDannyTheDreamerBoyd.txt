I looked around and it was the day,
That again will never come;
I could not help it but to sway,
Away from what would make me glum.
I thought that I've been granted life,
And so did life take but for granted;
I thought that time was yet rife,
And had my soul by life enchanted.
My life has passed before my eyes,
As what's alive was just no more;
I've never thought of any goodbyes,
And still of faith was but unsure.
I've seen the green swiftly fly,
As did the gray and too the blue;
I've felt all beauty at once die,
And couldn't stand that morbid view!
I've looked above and did scream,
At a god that there might not be:
'Look down on this scarlet stream,
And speak but of immortality! '
Though life may but immortal seem,
Whilst everything else ceases to be;
It could be nothing more but a dream,
And on the waking verge's just uncertainty!
I woke up thinking of:
'What if the world ends today?
You've had much mirth but it's not enough! '
Then hoped more mirth won't make me stray!
