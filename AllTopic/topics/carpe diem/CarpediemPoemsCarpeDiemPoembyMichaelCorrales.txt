Why live today for a better after life?
Why waste moments for a fate uncertain?
We've been granted  this existence.
So shall we bow out before the final curtain?
Live today like there is no tomorrow.
For tomorrow does not promise heaven or hell.
There is no paradise or lakes of fire.
And if there was how can you tell?
Live with pride, realise your dreams
and don't waste time on foolish fate.
Because if you die before your wake
are you sure you'll see a pearly gate?
For those who dedicate to follow
rules in the tomes of the manipulative
even if you live in sin
does your God not promise to forgive?
So are we to dine with Gods?
Well I don't not know.
But I refuse to pay pennance
to a landlord who does not show.
I am only assured one life to live
and waste it I shall never.
For I chose to be great today
a goal from which I will not sever.
You can keep Gods and Allah's
You can pray to your invisible friends.
You can prepare for a mythical tomorrow.
But it's in today I shall ascend.
