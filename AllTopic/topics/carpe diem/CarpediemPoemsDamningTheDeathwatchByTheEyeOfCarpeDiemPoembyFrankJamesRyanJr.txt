The river will never catch you
if you understand white water.
Lightening will never strike you
if you heed to distant thunder.
Symbols can never haunt you
if your third-eye eschews them.
Death ne'er be yours to beckon
by year, day, hour, or second.
So go sail a raft, ignore the sky,
as cloud formations symbolize,
before your eyes...as you and I
have finally come to realize...
no matter where your logic lies
we were all born to live and die.
