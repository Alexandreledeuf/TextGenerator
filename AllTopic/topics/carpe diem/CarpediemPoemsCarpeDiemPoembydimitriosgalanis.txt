Leuconoe
do not put the questions and look out to find
when it is to come my or yours end of life
that which Gods have given us.
It is impossible to find out.
So do not try even to tell it through the babylonian zodiacs.
It is better to endure whatever is to come,
the many winters or this only one
if it is the last  Jupiter has prescribed us,
the one just now turbulenting the thyrrenean sea.
Be wise, prepare the mixture of wine,
dwindle the great hopes
to be analogous to the short time in front
pick up each day
[like picking flowers up]
and do not trust the day to come after.
