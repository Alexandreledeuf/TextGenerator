Oh, seize this day, lads and loves!
Take it by the
scruff of the neck and yank
until your spirit lights a fire
that cannot be put out.
Mere flames
burn the heart that
is determined and ready.
Shout, my earthbound friends,
to the rooftops of encouragement! (YES!)
Eager ladies and gentlemen
dash out of prison workâ€¦
and into the freedom weekend.
Seize the day and
waste the infidel night!
Raise your voice!
Get your point across!
We have a choice!
Life beats loss!
Seize the final day!
