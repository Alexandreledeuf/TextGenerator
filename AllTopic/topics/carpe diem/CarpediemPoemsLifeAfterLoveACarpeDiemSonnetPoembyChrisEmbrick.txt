What better day to be alive
To search for treasure in the heart
Why with heartache's memory strive
If Cupid's arrow missed the mark
Time never waits for sorrow's grave
Or asks the rain to take a pause
Not every road through life is paved
Kept manicured to hide the flaws
Dare not allow failed love to anchor
Kept in harbor, dreams unfulfilled
Refuse all thoughts prone to rancor
Press through each day with stronger will
Time's too precious for deep sorrow
Live for today, dream tomorrow.
