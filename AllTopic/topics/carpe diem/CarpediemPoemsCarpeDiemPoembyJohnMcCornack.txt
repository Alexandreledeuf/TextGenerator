Ever so slowly the great wheel of life turns
Mother Earth smiles as we all scurry about
Searching for this and that
But what is it that we wantâ€¦.
A bigger Teepee?
Or another concrete road
or maybe a larger TV
Some even refuse to keep score
While others long for what they had
Yet most keep thinking they want more
