jasmine sends
its mindblowing
fragrance, allure
before it drops
to the ground
stepped on
and crushed
the pretty lass
picks her best
to cloth her years
colouring them with
dreams, excitements,
love, heartbreaks and all
before she loses her greatest asset
lined with lines that spread cancerous like spears
to stab at the heart
grandma's wedding pic
so dreamy her eyes
the man holding tight at the waist
beefing up her best years
jasmine sends its scent to the wind
an innocent pretty lass praying for love to come
inspired by
Carpe Diem
O mistress mine, where are you roaming?
O stay and hear! your true-love's coming
That can sing both high and low;
Trip no further, pretty sweeting,
Journey's end in lovers' meeting-
Every wise man's son doth know.
What is love? 'tis not hereafter;
Present mirth hath present laughter;
What's to come is still unsure:
In delay there lies no plenty, -
Then come kiss me, Sweet and twenty,
Youth's a stuff will not endure.
William Shakespeare
