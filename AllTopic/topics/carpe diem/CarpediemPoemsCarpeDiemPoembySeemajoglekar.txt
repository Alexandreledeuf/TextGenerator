O forlorn heart, so pure and unstained, yet so wary to commit,
Like the pensive bee that hovers over the flower, hesitant,
To seal the deal, burying deep his head in the arms of delight,
Cautious to approach, murmurs his annoyance in quiet.
What holds you back? What question plays on your mind?
An answering smile, to reciprocate?  An acceptance of arms
That carries the burden of your heavy heart? A subtle reprimand
At the dalliance that threw you in the way of harms? What qualms!
The same question plays on my heart. Am I worthy of this Adonis?
Ungrateful, rich at heart. Answer the stony years through which flows
Love’s justification, I draw my strength from that same love,
To stand guilty before you, my witness, stars that the steady sky tows.
My penitence, excuses, to cover your absences at the altar of love,
Shielding you from the sting of those sighing years, her angels
Kept appeased with my songs, its melody to your steady pace impart,
My pulse toiling harder to keep up with the largesse of your heart.
Watchful and guarded against the penetrating intensity of my eyes
Afraid to reveal too much too soon, what veil of words I spy.
As your warm eyes, to contain their depths desperately throw
Shadows, still the hungry eyes devour every emotion on my brow.
Come, seize the moment,
For when I faltered your torch has lit my way in the dark,
If you falter, trust me, pearls of my ardor shall light the spark,
Throw a smile to deter any doubts lurking around,
With a sign of recognition abound,
Wait till the glow hits my heart,
Give me time, for my sense have grown numb in your absence
Then let our understanding hands join in silence,
To finish God’s work, guided by God’s hands through the years.
