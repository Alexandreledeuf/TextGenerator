CARPE DIEM spells MAD RECIPE,
DREAM EPIC to PIERCE DAM, mind's waters flow
as DICE REMAP REMADE PIC, help to see
how anagrams shift focus, need to grow.
Thus what to some 'improvement' may appear
is but perspective, glass half empty, filled,
or hardships role reversed by change of gear,
self-pity sapped, snapped, joy mapped: beans are spilled.
So seize the day, in tune with all around,
both silence, sound, 'hope, faith and trust' are bars
to open mind that fain would leave the ground
of caterpillar, butterfly the stars.
True happiness turns yen of citizen
to zen, yins yang, yangs yin, springs flow from pen.
