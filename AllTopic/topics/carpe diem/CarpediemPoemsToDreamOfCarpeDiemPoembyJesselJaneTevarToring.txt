A corpse condemned to live
I long was lost
somewhere in my painful years
of grief, of doubts, of fears.
Ghost of my own memory
I long was dragged...
trapped inside my overt pain,
isolated, I ever been;
tied by threads unseen
I stay unmoved -
bound by fate unrest
I deem to stoop.
To live a life with life
I long did dream;
to dream to never drown
in woe, in qualms, in tears.
Prisoner of my own history
I long be freed
from ones my soul
played havoc with.
I long to feel my blood to rush
to feel, to touch... be felt, be touched.
Oh how I dream [and wake in it]
to live a life with life.
