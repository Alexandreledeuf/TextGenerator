Carpe diem 'Seize the Day' How bold...
Seize The Day. How does one do that?
Carpe diem, there are days, that like a
thief in the night, sneak up behind me,
and SEIZE ME!
Carpe diem...Seize The Day, how wonderful,
when there are days, that are within my
grasp...and then...I seize them!
Ahhh, now that I have them, I sometimes wonder,
what the hell do I do with that sized day, now?
I always was of the opinion that one should only
size the days, that they have a purpose for.
Now if I planed to stay indoors all day, what
would be the point of seizing the day?
On the other hand, to plan a lovely day, with
someone you care about-now that's a day to size!
Trust me, do not size any day, that you know not
what to do with. For if you do, you're dragging this
day around with you, not knowing what the hell
to do with it.
In all respects to the latins, who coined that
phrase, Carpe Diem, 'size the day, ' most of
them had no idea, what to do, with the day they sized!
Now the next time, someone utters those famous
words, Carpe Diem, 'size the day, ' look them
square in the eye and ask,
'If you size this day, what are you going to do
with it?
