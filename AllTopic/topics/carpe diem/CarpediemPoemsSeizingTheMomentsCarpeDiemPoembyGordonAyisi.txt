Life is nothing but one, a day
Fraught with moments eclectic be.
A breath, a whiff, frittered away
'Midst the drudgeries etched O Ye!
Surly snail, shell of oblivion
Retract you so swift, to flee life;
A shiny arrow quiver-sworn
Shoot forth like a skylark from strife.
What have thee to live for? Today!
Till thy morrow(s)  run dry wastrel
Unthrifty happiness waylay
To love, to live, mournful minstrel.
Seize the day, languishing flower.
Be grateful for every moment.
Carpe diem! Seize thy hour.
Bewail not thy lot ne'er for wont.
