As we grow up, we learn that even like one person that wasnt
suppose to even not let you down probably will. You will have
your heart broken probably more then once and its harder every time.
You'll break hearts too, so remember how it felt wen urs was broken.
You'll fight wi your best friend, You; ll blame a new love for things an
old one did. You'll cry cuz time is passing by too fast, and you'll eventually lose someone youe love. So take too many pictures, laugh
too much, and love like you never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness you; ll
never get back! ! ! !
