I hope you remember
This pretty life’s rule
Carpe Diem,
Mon Amour
Because everything
What exists between
Such a whiles as this
With you and me
Is just an empty space
To fill and feed our souls
By memories and hopes
For the next
Miracle of love
Maybe these are just a few
Whiles like this
Which makes us to believe
That it’s really worth to live
