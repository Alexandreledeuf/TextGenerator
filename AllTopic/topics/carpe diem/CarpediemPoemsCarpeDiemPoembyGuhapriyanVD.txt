Behind every goodbye there is a hope of new hi and
Behind every hi there is a pain of bidding bye sooner or later
The moments of life lies in between that short span
Spread your arms if you long for a hug
Open your heart if it aches for love
Dance and sing until the rain stops
Kiss passionately, if not your beloved at least the wind
Enjoy the beauty of nature in countless ways
Take chances and dare to fail, you will have the second
Forever and never-ending too comes to an end, Wait not
Until the moment arrives, seize and live it.
