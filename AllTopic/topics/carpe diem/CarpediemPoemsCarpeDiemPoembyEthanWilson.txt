Seize the day and do not delay
Or else there be a worse price to pay
For it is your life to waste not mine
I am but a man nothing divine
Be prepared to bear the worst
But just remember to be stronger then curse
I will live my life by this motto
From this day forth and tomorrow
Carpe Diem be the phrase
If every man lived by that we'd know the way
