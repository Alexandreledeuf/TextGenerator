the shadow of today
clouds our minds
forgotten thoughts
of yesterday
hopes of tomorrow
crushed today
memories of todays yesterday
quickly fading away
lessons learned
lost by the time of a new day
every day has its own pain
todays different than tomorrows
the shadow of today
covers our souls in deep gray
for today will just be another
forgotten yesterday
