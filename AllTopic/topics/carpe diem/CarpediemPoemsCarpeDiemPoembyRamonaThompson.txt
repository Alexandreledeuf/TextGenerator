Carpe Diem
Seize the day
Let no hour, minute or second pass
Without living it to the fullest and the best that you can
Linger and breath not where there is no fun to be had
Shed your tears not over regrets and time misspent
Rather weep with joy
For those joyous, wonderous years spent
Gathering forth memories and tidings of good cheer
To comfort you in the days of old that will all too soon come your way
Remember, always remember my friends to
Carpe Diem
