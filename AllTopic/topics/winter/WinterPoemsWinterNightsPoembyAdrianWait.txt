What is this feeling within my heart;
Concealed  by  daylight hours, in  a  shroud of taut restraint.
Winter  evenings  consume,  yesterdays  pursue me,
Smiling, speaking, acting – I can cope, I can cope….
An injured heart bares  healing in the nearness of love,
Yet love becomes frigid  when winter sweeps in, I am alone.
The  world is cold, my heart  laments in  fearful silence
Winter, winter,  where are your friends? ,
Betrayed by the sheath of night, rejoicing in decay
In scornful silence, reflecting on unfulfilled dreams,
Dreading the night, enduring the day. Winter.
Hopes and Dreams,  rest  upon a cradle of love,
Unconditional, fruitful, forbearing, eternal,
Winter  steals, freezes,  and denies.
To be alone in this season, is to be alone,
No voices, no echoes, no gentle memories shared.
A solitary tree yielding to an  unfeeling winter,
Surrendering its leaves  to  winters steel sky.
Fleeting Sunshine, stolen,   lacking of kindness,  or  warmth
Sheets of invasive rain, such unforgiving indifference
Winter is  reconciliation without forgiveness
Yet,  it is the door to Spring, and the resurrection of hope.
