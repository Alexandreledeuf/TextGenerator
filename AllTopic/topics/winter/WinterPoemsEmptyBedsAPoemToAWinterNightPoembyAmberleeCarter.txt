Ok, so I'm sorry.
Isn't that what you wanted to know?
in that case, you win.
I'll send back your pictures and your books,
you can keep the dictionary, some day
you might put it to use.
Assuming you ever want
to look up the definition of
relationship or abandonment.
I'll stop being acrimonious,
I'll stop talking to your sibling.
This year I promise to:
take better care of myself,
to rest more,
to read more,
to write more
and overall, just exist more.
I'll stop blaming you for everything,
though it's all your fault.
I'll accept my own downfalls:
loving you more,
wanting you more,
needing you more.
So, yeah,
I'll send back the pieces of you:
Your voice, the ever present
ringing in my ears.
Your avoidance, my constant worry.
However,
I'm keeping the kiss,
your last letter and the paper cut.
