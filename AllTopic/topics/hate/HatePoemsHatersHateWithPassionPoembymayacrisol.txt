I started out expressing my thoughts...
pouring out my heart and soul
i never planned to look around
i just needed a pad to write my thoughts
but papers get thrown away and misplaced
this site was perfect...just perfect..it felt like home
i thought i could say anything i want
express my ideas without insulting others
refute, argue, agree accordingly
but to never never hate personally
the poser...why because it's not my place
to judge people i don't really know so well
I do rant when poked and provoked
but i don't go chasing the hater
just to dis him all over the board
making me ponder deeply now
I have so much hate inside they say
but never with such passion as they.
