Ouch, to cut my finger...
Pain and blood spills and does longly stay and linger.
To give my sliced append-aged digit a much needed bath...
I won't cook for a living, or go to school for typing or even take math.
Math and onions i do not like...
I'd rather have a tooth pulled or be super glued to a seat-less one peddled
down hill travelling brake-less bike.
I'll only eat onions that are totally cooked...I wont go to a restaurant and look on a menu to order it from the waitress, it will never be booked.
