I hate the way you look at me,
And the way you stand and stare,
I hate how you have a lame excuse,
For almost never being there.
I hate it when you always drink,
And always raise your voice,
I hate it most when you call me her,
You’re leaving me no choice.
I hate it when you turn your back,
And mumble ‘not tonight’
I hate it when you go away,
And then turn your mobile off all night.
I hate it when you sometimes lie,
And keep your secrets deep,
I hate it when you don’t want sex,
Or lie away from me to sleep.
I hate the way you make me feel,
When fit girls give you attention,
I hate the fact my love is real,
And the way you snub my affection.
I hate it when you get me mad,
And when you make me cry,
I hate it when I wake up sad,
Those days I just want to die.
I hate it when you make me laugh,
And the way you read my mind,
I hate that annoying music you play,
And the way you’re always kind.
I hate the fact I don’t hate you,
And how I never will,
Its just you piss me off,
You make me want to kill.
I hate it that you’re good in bed,
When you feel the need,
I hate it when you’re in my head,
And make my thoughts seem easy to read.
I hate the fact I love you,
And how you’re some what right,
I hate it that I’ll always love you,
Forever from morning to night.
