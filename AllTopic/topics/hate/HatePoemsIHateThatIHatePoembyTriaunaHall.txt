I hate the way you treat me
I hate that everything is how you want it to be
I hate all your lies and silly games
I hate how you make them all the same
I hate that I feel this way
I hate that I can't take the pain away
I hate that I'm your back bone
I hate being in the same zone
I hate the way you make me feel
I hate the pain won't heal
I hate that you are too blind to see
I hate that I want to leave
I hate not wanting to be around
I hate your mouth that produces bad sounds
I hate a lot of other things too
But I hate that you make me hate you
