They say hate is another fear
A fear to not love
A fear to not belong
A fear to not be here
A fear that is wrong
I'm consumed with more than enough
I feel it all the time
More than the feeling of love
More than being afraid
Dark thoughts make me cold
Making it a part of me
Until I grow old
Until I can no longer see
I let the evil within
Take over my soul
By commiting this sin
I pay a greater toll
Slowly, now I'm fading
Blurry and freezy
It hurts to be hating.
