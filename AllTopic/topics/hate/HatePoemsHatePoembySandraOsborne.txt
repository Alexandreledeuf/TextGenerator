Somewhere, it must have happened first,
The fear, the anger,
The helpless feeling of guilt.
Somewhere, it must have happened first,
The sarcasm, the malice,
The wearied feeling of shame.
Somewhere, it must have happened first,
The desertion, the anarchy,
The drained feeling of alone.
Somewhere, it must have happened first,
The lost love, the lost faith,
The stoic feeling of the end
Somewhere, it must have happened first,
Somewhere, it must have.
