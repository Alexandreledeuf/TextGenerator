Sad and lonely
Depressed
Thinking about suicide
Not just sometimes
But all the time
I write these words in digust
Upon my mirror
In my own blood
Glaring back at me
I hate myself and I wanna die
Pent up emotions
Ripping me apart
Inside my head is a endless chant
Bugging and never ending
Urging me to just go ahead and give up
Today, tomorrow, and yesterday
Always it's the same
I can't stop it
Not even sure that I want to
All I know for sure is
I hate myself and I wanna die
So many times
I've thought about it
Even come close to carrying my threat through
Cos it seems to me to be
Sad but true
No one here on this earth really gives a damm about me
Pitiful ugly me
The stuff nightmares must surely be made of
Bringing my funeral date a little bit closer still
I write these words that keep on breaking my heart
Over and over and over again
I hate myself and I wanna die
No one's fault but my own
I know that
I accept that
Just not strong enough to handle this life on my own
So soon
Very, very soon
I promise that I will make my final exit
Silently and without a word
So that I don't disturb any of your happy lifes
I'll whisper it to myself one last time before I go
What I would like you to crave on my tombstone when I'm finally gone at last
Please don't be too sad
Cos it's ok
Really it is
Cos the truth is
It was her choice
She hated herself and she wanted to die......
