Don't you just hate it when you lose control?
You try so hard to keep your mouth shut
Then some idiot pushes you over the edge -
And your mouth runs away with you?
Don't you just hate it when you do your best
To be open and nonjudgemental
Then something snaps and the bitch comes out
And you end up looking like a fool?
I guess it's just human nature at fault
Am I really that shallow and crass?
But I tell you some days it's all I can do
Not to kick some dumb jerk in the ass!
Oh..................that felt good! ! ! !
