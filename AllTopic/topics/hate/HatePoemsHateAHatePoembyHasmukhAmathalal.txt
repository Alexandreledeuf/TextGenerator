Just think of hate
Consciously relate
Try to valuate
And think of fate
It shall provide
And divide
Your opinion
For disunion
It burns you from within
Pushes to no more gain
It has restless background
Hat is seen and found
Such is impact
And it is very much fact
We lead hostile world
And invite miseries untold
Why not hate a "hate"?
Why not greet and invite?
You will have sound sleep
That shall always have cheers to keep
