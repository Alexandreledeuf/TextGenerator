I hate the way you act
I hate the way you dress
I hate the way you smell
And you hair looks a mess
I hate the way you tease
I hate the way you beg
I hate the way you talk
And I hate your hairy legs
I hate all you friends
And your family to boot
But i still find myself falling in love with you.
