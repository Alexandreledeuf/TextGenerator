there is so much hate,
and not enough joy
to balance all things out,
and when you get overwhelmed
you just want to shout.
to the heavens above
to the earth below
to everyone around.
but even though you open your mouth,
no one hears a sound.
is it because they were born deaf to the world
or because they choose to be
someone who doesn't give a crap
about what happens to you or me.
i guess what i'm saying is that we need to act,
don't leave it up to fate,
because so many things can go wrong
that we cannot help but hate.
