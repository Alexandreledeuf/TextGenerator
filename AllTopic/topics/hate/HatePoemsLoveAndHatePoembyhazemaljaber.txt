whom i love strongly is you...
whom i hate strongly too is you...
whom i need strongly is you...
who i refuse is also you...
never to be my beloved...
the first whom taught me a love is you...
the first whom taught me a yearning is you...
the first whom taught me a craziness is you...
and you also the first whom taught me a death from over wait..
never to be my friend...
because of you, i discovered a lands` love...
because of you, i rebuild my dreams...
because of you, i recovered my days again...
and because of you, i raised my white flag,
and declared my giving up...
never to be my beloved nor my friend...
i refuse to be your fire...
and you to be my blaze too...
