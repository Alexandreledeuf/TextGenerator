I hate my life and don't ask why
Cause you might think its just a lie
Everyone hates me, Everyone left me
I know that it sounds crazy
But its true, if you can see
Be what you can be
I feel invisible but no one cares
Loneliness is what i cant bare
Tears run down, my eyes start to sting
I'm running out of tears, but i Kept on Crying
No more tears, need to cry more
Blood replaced my tears, but spilling out more
My heart beats slower, my breathing becomes shallow
I fall on the ground, everything becomes blury
I can die right now since no one cares
Yes, that's what I should do
I close my eyes
I'll go to my dreamworld
My heart stops beating
My body stays still, my soul breaks and smiles no more.
