I hate my mom
i hate the way she doesn't call
i hate the way he act like i'm not here child
At least my dad is there for me.
I hate the way she thows me away like i don't belong
But hey i act the parent and call you
o grow up and tart acting like a adult.
So i guess you got your wish goodbye see you heaven 'adios'
