i dont hate you
like i should
what youve done to me
others would
im not angry
but im not happy either
at least you told me
i just need a breather
i need time to think
about what to do
time to think
of my feelings of you
i love you
i always will
after what you told me
i need time to heal
if we decide
never to speak again
ill love you forever
til the end
im forgiving
no matter why
no matter what
even if i die
i wont live my life
going thru hate
God says'to forgive'
to get thru his gate
one day when your watching
the birds in the sky
remember me
after i have died
so i leave you with
these words from me
I Love You forever
and please forgive me
as i have done you
