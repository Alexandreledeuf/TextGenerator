I love you
And I hate you for it.
You made me fall in love with you
I’m not entirely sure why
You are cocky, and self-assured
You are vain, and temperamental
But I love you because of that
Not in spite of it.
I don’t need extravagance
Or anything to impress me
That job is already done.
I just want you.
And I hate you for it.
You show no pretence
Or false smiles
No airs or graces
And I hate you for it
Where is the line between love and hate?
I just want
YOU
