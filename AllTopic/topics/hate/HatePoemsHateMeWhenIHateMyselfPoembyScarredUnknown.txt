Hate me when I hate myself
Hate me when I love myself
Just hate me you know you do
Hate me when I say I do
Blame me for every thing
Blame me for all the lies
Just blame me when something’s wrong
Blame me when you need to
Fight me on everything
Fight me when you’re mad at her
Fighting me makes it ok
So fight me every single day
Love me what I love myself
Love me when I hate myself
Just love me you know you do
Love me when you say you do
