i hate it when u look at me
i hate it when u smile ur smile
i hate it when u say hi 2 me and wave
i hate it when u think u noe everything
i hate it when ur with ur friends
and not me
i hate it when u dont say hi
i dont hate u
i just realized that i love u
i just hate it when u dont do these things 2 me
i hate it when ur not around
i hate u
but i love u at the same time
