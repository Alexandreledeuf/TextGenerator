I am so scared, finding it hard to breath,
my heart beats so fast, I want it to stop.
I can hear your footsteps nearing my door.
I cringe, bite my nails and sob into my pillow.
I can feel the stench of your breath on the side of my face.
Your touch feels like a bullet, sharp, hot and dangerous.
You enter inside me, sharply, with so much heat, penetrating too deep. You are a monster.
You whisper ' I love you '
I silently reply ' I hate you, daddy '
You don't hear my screams or see my tears, for if you did, you would put an end to my fears.
I lay there, my body a dead weight.
I take myself off to another land of beauty and love.
When you have finished your deadly sin, you smirk at me.
Your dark, evil eyes, you're the spawn of the devil.
As you leave my room of torture,
I turn over, begin to sob into my pillow,
Waiting for the pain and fears to return.
I know you will be back again, to-morrow!
I hate you daddy.
