drive me crazy
make me insane
all these emotions
run through my brain.
you make me feel
all these things
i want to hate you
but its not happening.
you annoy me
but make me smile.
you have an arrogance about you
which makes me want to hit you.
i look at you
feel your stare
i try to ignore
these feelings i bear.
emotions clash
hate and love
can you feel both
things at once?
is it possible? is it wrong?
to want to hate
and love you at once?
