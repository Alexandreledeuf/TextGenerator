my tears are flowing like a rain,
when am trying to catch that love train,
my feet fails to move as they feel pain,
through the bad memories existing in my brain.
I remember my life's suffering,
when he took me for granted, i was crying,
A nobody, useless it's hurting
some times it's a crime memorizing.
Testing his knife on my body! it happened,
even the donkey felt sorry for me, my cat cried,
my voice of pain was like a guitar tuned.
I can't believe today am  somebody.
his photocopy standing over me, needs help,
i feel sorry  for her but i can't stop,
she's beautifully on making a step,
but the memories i have i can't help.
