I’m tearing in two
And I’m not sure what to do
My heart is screaming I love him
My mind saying I hate him
What do I do
I love him, but I hate him?
I love everything about him
I love how he smiles
I love how he can make me smile
I love how no matter what is going on.
I love how he will always be there
But all the same
I hate him
I hate everything he means for
I hate how he can make me smile
No matter how hard I try not to
I hate how he can make me cry
I hate how he can make me sad
I hate how he can make me feel
I hate how he looks at me with his eyes so kind
I hate how all of this makes me love him even more
I hate how I can’t hate him
Most of all I hate myself
I hate myself because
I can never hate you
