Love is not hate
Hate is not the answer to everything
Don’t burn your neighbor’s house down
Just because she comes from the Middle East
She is just the same as you
Don’t bring bombs to Afghanistan or Iraq
Bring flowers and love
Because we were created equal not to be looked as alien
We might come from different cultures or different places
It doesn't matter! ! !
We all are humans
We all have 2 hands 2 feet 10 fingers in all
Although we all may be different looking
We are all from the same race
The Human Race
