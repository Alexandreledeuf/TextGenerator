Please spare me your secrets
I am not your best friend
(atleast not yet! !)
‘N I am sorry to break this to you
But …
I am not sure if I would ever be
Not that I don’t like you
But…
You are not my type
Or the other way around
So save your secrets to yourself
I don’t want to hear any, not even a bit
It disturbs me and haunts me
It also ruins my day each and every minute
I know someday you will read this
And hate me like some kind of disease
‘N instead of telling my secrets
I write them down in form of poems
‘N guess what? ? ?
I gain PEACE
‘N I got nothing to lose
So keep your secrets to yourself
No matter whose! ! !
