Daddy, I hate you
Daddy, I love you
Daddy, I really don't have a clue
But, that one time I flew
But, you didn't care
It isn't fair
You never share
What is with you? ?
Do I need to hit you with my shoe?
That is covered with dog doo
You never made me happy
You always said my hair was nappy
Don't you love me
I love you
Wait, no I don't!
I hate you
You made me feel blue
Please, go away
I'm not even gonna play
Or, i'll make you out of clay
Don't delay
Just go away
