a girl named hate
stood at heavens gate
just wishing to be let in
she breathed out sin
and they shuned her
her pain a blur
she walked away
to try again another day
a girl named hate
stood at hells gate
she breathed out sin
and they let her in
they did not judge her
they loved her for sure
and there she will stay
day after day
that girl named hate
broke away from fate
she stayed were she fit in
she stayed with her sin
they did not hate her
they befriended her
things usualy turn out that way
when you tell some one to go away
