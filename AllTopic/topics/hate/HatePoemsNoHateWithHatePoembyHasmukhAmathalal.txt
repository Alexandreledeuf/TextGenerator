No hate with hate
Thursday,10th January 2019
If we can win over the internal enemies
if the answer is in yes, then there lies
the solution for all tragedies
we have the medicine and remedy
Why go outside and advocate?
take the refuge under the guise of lies and relate
the things which are common
for all of us as human beings
Whoever has won over the hatred
happiness has always led
the humanity to the purposeful end
we have respected and bowed to such trend
hate emanates fromthe greed and selfishness
the lines can be traced on the face
the visible displeasure is easily noticed
its repercussions are easily felt but roots not traced
we burn with the rage
write it down on the page
but again return to an old theme
and follow them
