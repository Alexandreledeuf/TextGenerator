I hate myself for this
I hate this person I've become
I hate who I am and who I thought I would never be
I hate my father for making me this way
I hate the selfishness I have now become
I hate the endless pain I put people through
I hate the way I hide myself in this pain
I hate the crazy world Im living in called my life
I hate when my friends suffer because of my problems
I hate the fact that everything I've worked
so hard not to be is what defines me
I hate that people cant see who I really am
I hate that my heart is broken with no one to put it back together
