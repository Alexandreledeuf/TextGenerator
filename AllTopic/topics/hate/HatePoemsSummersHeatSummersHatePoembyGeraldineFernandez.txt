Oh, summer’s heat,
In my life it lit;
In the mind aims to penetrate,
This moment’s flame, how I hate.
Oppressing heat seems eternal,
Breeze that’s cool is but ephemeral;
Sultry nights embrace you so tight,
Blinding you in the magic shards of light.
Hell is the summer’s day,
With the sun’s burning ray;
It destroys thy once magnificent lea,
And turns to mud the beatific sea.
Oh, summer’s heat,
Wane the aches just a bit;
The puissant heat, wind can’t abate,
This moment’s flame, how I utterly hate.
