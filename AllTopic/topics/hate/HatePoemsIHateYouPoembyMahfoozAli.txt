I hate you
I hate you
I hate everything you do to me
everything you want me to be
I hate the way you talk behind me
I hate the way you stare at me as I go by
I hate the way you make fun of me
Every single day
I hate the way you make me cry at night
and each and everyday
I hate the way you tried to kill me
I hate the way you kill my emotions
I hate the way  you hate me more and more
each and everyday
you are the one that I hate the most for all the things you did
I will hate you more and more every single day
and I also hate my father because............
he brings you in as
my step-mother.
