I hate it when you look at me
I hate it when you smile
I hate it when you catch my eye
I hate it when you lie
I hate it when you just walkout
I hate it when you shout
I hate it when you think you know
I hate it when you say hello
I hate it when you think I care
I hate it when you glare
I hate the way you stare
And never look mad
I hate the way you love me
Like I was the only one you had
I hate that I can’t hate you even if I tried
And don’t forget that I only saying all this
b\c I can never hate you
