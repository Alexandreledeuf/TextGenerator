I hate the way i hate you
I hate the way i love you
I hate it that i can’t help thinking of you
I hate the way i care for you
I hate the way you don’t know
Ill always be a friend to you cause my feeling i cannot show
I hate the way i can’t move on
I hate that i can’t even try
I hate that when we fall out why am i the one who cries
I hate the way you talk to me
I hate the way you stare
But most of all i hate how can’t admit that there’s nothing there
I hate that cause of you these tears i cry
I hate that i have no choice but to say goodbye
