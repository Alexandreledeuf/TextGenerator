I hate how you left me without any sign,
I hate that you moved on without saying goodbye,
I hate how your smile makes me give in,
I hate that your always making me want to caress your skin,
I hate how you can't talk to me when she's around,
I hate that when she leaves you look me up and down,
I hate how you made a mark in my heart,
I hate that you let us drift apart,
I hate how when I say I hate you I don't really mean it,
But most of all....
I hate how you know I can't hate you.....
And never will.
