The fate of hate is hate
Hate was his way of life
Humanity he did not like
Killed thousands
Around the world
Taught others
To live in hate
In the name of religion
Called himself a human
Lived like a demon
Spread terror on the earth
Did not get
Two yards for himself
Remains buried
In the depth of the sea
Was cursed by everybody
From a child to elderly
His fate was known
Long before he died
Tried his best to hide
But could not survive
The fate of hate is hate
Hate killed hate
