I hate the way you tease me,
I hate the way you walk.
I hate the way you look at me,
I hate the way you talk.
I hate the way you run around,
I hate the way you speak.
I hate the way you write your words,
I hate the way you greet.
I hate the way you srut around
like you have it all,
but most of all
I hate the way I don't hate you at all.
