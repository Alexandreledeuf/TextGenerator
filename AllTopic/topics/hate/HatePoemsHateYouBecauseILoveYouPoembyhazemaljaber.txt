You run through my life...
and took me away from my world...
to yours, unknown world...
enjoyed with my feelings as well...
and make my heart to gave up for you...
and kept it to sail into your love...
and liberated my heart from every thing...
and became in love with you with unlimited love...
hate you...
because i love you...
because your love drove me so crazy...
and because it spoke to my heart through your eyes...
and gave me unexpected desires...
which i never thought about it before...
hate you...
because you gave me a feelings...
and thought that you were my certain destiny...
and that you will dance with me under the rain...
and you will take me from among all people...
hate you, because i love you...
and do not know why i love you...
hate you...
because you owned on my heart...
and can`t get it now back from you...
and because you snatched my visual...
and became not see any one except you...
hate you...
because you left me alone...
after my heart gave up to you...
and became so crazy for you...
and lived inside...
in my dreams and wherever i be...
and felt with the happiness...
and suddenly....
saw you while you went away from my life...
to keep me to suffer again with my loneliness...
to suffer my pains as i been before...
and to live again with my tears...
hate you...
because you stole my freedom...
and locked up my heart in your jail...
while i don`t know, which sin i did...
hate you or love you...
i really do not know...
but i wish that i can hate you...
because i still love you...
