I hate myself for hurting you
The pain and heartache i put you through
I killed the love that we once had
I took everything good and turned it bad
I hate myself for hurting you
Your pain i wish i could undo
In the end all we did was shout
I chewed you up and spat you out
I hate myself for hurting you
And killing the love that we once knew
I'm sorry for not giving you the best of me
I'm sorry things aren't how they used to be
I hate myself for hurting you
The pain and heartache i put you through
I know that i made you scream and cry
These things i simply can't deny
I hate myself for hurting you
Your pain i wish i could undo
I didn't mean to treat you like dirt
I can't imagine how much it must hurt
I hate myself for hurting you
And killing the love that we once knew
I know there is nothing i can say or do
But i'm so so sorry for hurting you
