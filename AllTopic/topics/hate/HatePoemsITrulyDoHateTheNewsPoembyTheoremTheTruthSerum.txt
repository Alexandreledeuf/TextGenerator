I truly do hate the news
It's full of half truths
And disposable heroes
It ruins the lives of many
The media swarms the story
If your the story
Then stay home and stay inside
Though from the media you cannot hide
They'll look over your fence
Or through your window
For that one snapshot
People say gunshot's kill a person
But so do snapshots
Once your famous
You can never live a normal life
It is cruel how we know more
About celebrities than we do of ourselves
How does reading garbage make us better
A man makes a profit
Off the magazine
Who is unfit to have that money
He ruins lives and me and you
He tells us how to look
And what we should be interested in
I truly do hate the news
