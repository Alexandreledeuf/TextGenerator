Have I ever hurt you?
Hit you?
Pierced you?
Have I ever made you cry?
Scream?
Want to die?
Have I given you shit that screws up your life?
Like drugs, or alcohol, that makes you high?
Have I handed a dagger to you?
Point a gun at your head?
Tie a string around your neck?
Leave you alone with some cold crimson instrument?
Have I ever asked you to sell yourself short?
Did I tell you something was impossible?
Have I ever told you ‘dude, you’re sucha piece of shit’?
Have I done or said something,
To make you want to hurt yourself?
Have I ever put shit on your shoulders?
Prepared you for the slaughters?
Have I said to you
‘there is no way your gunna make it through this life’?
Do I make you think life sucks?
That everything has locks?
Have I made you feel lonely?
Hopeless?
Or immense negativity?
Have I threatened to kill you?
Beat you?
Hurt you?
Made you shed tears?
Blood?
Prayers?
Have I ever made you scream from inner pain?
Deep fears,
That can’t be slain?
Do I hate you?
