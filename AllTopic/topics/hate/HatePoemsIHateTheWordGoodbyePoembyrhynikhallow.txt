no one usually likes the word goodbye.
its a painful word.
that hurts so many poeple
in so many ways.
When your love says goodbye
is that i'll see you later.
or does it mean its 'over'.
goodbye hurt me once
it was the end of something good,
i wish there wasnt a goodbye
why wouldnt it have been 'hi'?
