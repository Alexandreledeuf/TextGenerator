I hate you
I hate that you left me stand stupid for so long
I hate that you thought I could or would take it.
I hate you
I hate that you let me go
I hate that you left me standing alone.
I hate you
I hate that you couldn't prove me wrong
I hate that I was right.
I hate you
I hate that I met you
I hate that I opened  my heart
I hate that it was to you
I hate that I love you
I hate you
I hate that I lost my clear mind
I hate that I lost my direction
I hate that I lost it because of you
I hate you
I hate that I hate you
It wasn't suppose to be like this.
I hate you.
