I try to hide
But you just keep finding me
I try to run
But you are the one I bump
I try to forget
But you just smile and say
'Trying to run from yourself
Isn't going to get you anywhere'
I hide from myself
I run from myself
I try to forget myself
But when I look in a mirror
You stare at me with a smirk
But all I know is
I have to run
but how can you lose yourself
easy
Just kill yourself
I hate myself
