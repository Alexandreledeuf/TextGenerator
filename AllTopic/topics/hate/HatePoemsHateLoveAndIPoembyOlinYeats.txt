Hate by my side,
Wagging his tail
And wanting to be worshiped.
Love by my side,
Walking with stealth
And wanting to be given.
Hate runs in front,
And points which way
Biting and clawing to have his will.
Love by my side,
Walking still so quietly
And wanting to be given.
We come to a traveler
-Hate, Love, and I-
Who is burdened and hurt.
Hate runs on
Love stands by his side
And I am-in the middle-trying to make my choice.
