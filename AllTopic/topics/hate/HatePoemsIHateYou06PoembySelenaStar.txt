You used to call me your sunshine
And you used to be really fine
I wanted to be in your life
And now i am your ex wife
I hate you so bad for that
We used to be really wild
But we never had a child
I was really cool
But i ended up with a fool
I hate you baby boy
I told you i loved you
And you said you love me too
But how could that be
When in the end you said you hated me
So now i hate you too
You are still in my half broken heart
While your car is a one wheeled shopping cart
You always were beggin
You can never enter my heart again
Because i hate you
