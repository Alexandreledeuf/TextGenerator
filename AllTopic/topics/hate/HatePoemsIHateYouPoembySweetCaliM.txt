This poem is to my father. It's a long story, but this is how I feel and this is my way of helping myself feel better after what he did....
I know everyone says hate is a strong word
Hate is a strong
Word
Yeah but in my case
I can use it
I hate you
You bring me nothing but
Anger, pain
Disgust
I may have your looks
But I am not you
I have a brain
I use it, unlike yourself
As a young woman
Almost grown
I know this now
I don't need you
And I think you know why
Why you ask
Because I
Hate you
