I hate the hate that resides in me now
I hate the hate that is so heavy it weighs me down
I hate the hate that keeps my emotions tightly wound
I hate the hate that charges my wall
I hate the hate that lies to strengthen my fall
I hate the hate that has me in chains
I hate the hate that courses through my veins
I hate the hate that is a shadow at my side
I hate the hate that has stolen my mind
I hate the hate that blinds me from the stars
I hate the hate that has created my war
I hate the hate that has stolen my grace
My scarlet letter written all over my face
