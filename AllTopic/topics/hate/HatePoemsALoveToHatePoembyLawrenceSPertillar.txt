Is it getting clearer...
For those who fear to be themselves.
They who have entertained disrespect,
To the point where none is left.
Inspected in depth...
Or quests requested!
Blinded they are like fools on crack!
Using tools of fools to keep themselves back.
Blinded they are like fools on crack.
Or a black cat who can't stop giving 'bad' vibes,
An image to attack!
Blinded they are like fools on crack!
Seeking a shoulder to cry on...
And a pat on their backs!
Blinded they are like fools on crack.
Trying in doped slickness,
But losing themselves...
With weakened backbones attacked!
Is it getting clearer...
For those who fear to be themselves.
With a fear that endears them,
With a love to hate!
Berating unappreciated wisdom at stake!
