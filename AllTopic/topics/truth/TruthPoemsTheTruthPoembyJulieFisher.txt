The teenager blasting his favourite tunes
Drowning his thoughts and feelings
In a muddy swamp of filthy lyrics.
The postman cheerfully whistling
As he does his round
An osrich, stuck in the sands of denial
His wife has just left him for a woman.
A mother wrapping her daughters' presents
It's Christmas Eve
Passively abusing and complicit
As her new husband violates her child in the bedroom
Right above her.
People would rather die than face the Truth.
