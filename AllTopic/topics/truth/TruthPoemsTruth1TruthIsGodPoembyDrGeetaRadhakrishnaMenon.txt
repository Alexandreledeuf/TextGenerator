The wise men of the world embraced
The Truth' as
The most venerated principle of life;
The path of all the scriptures of this world,
The path of the enlightened souls!
The Absolute Truth is attained
Through love,
Through compassion,
Through unity and oneness, for
Truth is God and God is Truth!
