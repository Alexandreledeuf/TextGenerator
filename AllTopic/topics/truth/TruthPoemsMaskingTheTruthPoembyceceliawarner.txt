My life was based
on masking the truth,
not allowed to express feelings
buried throughout my youth.
'Don't tell others
what goes on behind closed doors, '
still masking the truth
and developing sores.
As time passed,
as time always does,
what was masking the truth,
still is, as it was...
I'm not talking about
telling big or even little white lies,
I'm tallking about masking pain
through silence and lying eyes.
If all this seems too confusing
then try walking in my shoes...
It feels just as confusing
because these are not the feelings I'd choose!
Most of my life,
the reason or situation didn't matter,
the mask would go up
as I feel my sanity shatter.
