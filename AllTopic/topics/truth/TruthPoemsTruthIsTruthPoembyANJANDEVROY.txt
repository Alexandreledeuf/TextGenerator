Truth is always truth,
No one can deny it,
No one can defame it,
The sun is still shining brightly
At daytime like a king,
The serene moon is still shining
Like a queen in the night sky,
Gentle breeze is still blowing
To soothe the pensive and weary heart,
Sweet birds are also singing in the pleasant atmosphere
And the spring is still reigning in nature as usual;
So, there is nothing to worry,
Be happy and joyous,
Truth is definitely prevailing in this beautiful world.
