I was so tied to play this game
I never found my situation without pain
Why you put me in?
I thought that we are all to blame
I'm the man from the outside
People think that I'm a stupid guy
I'm a good player in the other game
But why now I feelany shame?
Why you try to put the wheel on the ship?
Why you want to make the unkonws to believed?
Just face to truth
And we'll know what we lose
If you and I could make it better
Let me back to my space
On the start line of my red life
I will rebirth...
...
The world let me down
Should I change it all
Or back home?
...
A man always half to success and half to fail
