so familiar
an echo
an echo
from my heart
i turn to look
and the years
that carve that
emptiness
large as cave
sprout legs to
run to me
and my mind
rushes to embrace the
most endearing ones
so many lines
we traverse
that remind us
of the longing
that has bitten
its way into us
the years that help
lay bare the truth
between us
the truth that has fallen
between so many
painful lines
