For each simple random kind act
A small flower grows in my soul,
For each beautiful flower observed
A random kind act grows in my heart
For each loving smile I give
A dew drop comes to my dreams
For each beautiful dew drop I see
A smile is adorning my face
For each simple truth I speak
My soul is touched by a breeze
For each lovely breeze I feel
A simple truth is revealed
