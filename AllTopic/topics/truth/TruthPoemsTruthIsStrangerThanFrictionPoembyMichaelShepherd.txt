The joy of truth is
that it can be funnier,
crazier,
than fiction.
On September 16 the referee
suspended a football match
following complaints by the spectators
that the players on both
multicultural or should I say
multiracial teams
had been racially abusing each other
with terms like 'black bastard'
a player corrected this, explaining
that it wasn't racial abuse but
'sledging' - to put off
players from kicking penalties etc.:
'Sure it was abuse, but there
was no racism'
well that's alright then, after all
it's a multi, er, cultural society
and the tackling was clean and
good sportsmanship sorta
