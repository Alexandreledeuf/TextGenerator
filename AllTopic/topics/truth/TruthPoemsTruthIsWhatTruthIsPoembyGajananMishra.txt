Truth is what truth is
Truth is feeling, truth is living
Truth is the realization of life.
Let us live in Truth
Truth in quality and in quantity
Let us discover truth in entire forming.
It is a fact, nothing lacks in Truth
Truth is the beginning and truth is the ending
And in between we find only truth
Nothing but the truth.
It is the vision that is truth
It is the knowledge that is truth
The path is the truth, the opinion is the truth
And we find the love and the life-drama in love is only Truth.
