There is no need to celebrate today.
There is no joy,  no promise with the sun.
Days are merely shadows that fade away.
Thoughts of what should have been have just begun.
Our lives were carefree just a while ago.
We had each other's love and it was clear
Our plans were fine and firm; our days would glow.
No folly or no foe could interfere.
In an instant fortune can be changed.
Cruel chance can cut and conquer the sublime.
No accident can be rearranged.
No prayer, faith or money can turn back time.
The Good are taken and their dreams are torn.
Pain rips my breath while fairness turns away.
Now, every path is barren and forlorn.
For you I mourn... until my dying day.
