Truth truth truth
Everything is truth
The earth the water
The fire the air the ether
All that are accepted as truth
You are the original truth, my dear
Everything pertaining to You is also truth
Your body is truth Your knowledge is truth
Your smile is truth Your pleasure is truth
My offering is truth my surrender is truth
Your protection is also truth
Truth truth truth
Everything is truth
My dear, see my love is truth.
