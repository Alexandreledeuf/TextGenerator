A brave face can certainly be misunderstood.
Too soon lonely in the darkness of the night.
Afraid, crying, hurting out of sight.
No one knows how hard one must fight.
Brave they are to those around them, trying
not to break the silence of what is really
haunting them. A pillar of strength for all to be
in awe, when deep inside there is a flaw.
They walk with dignity for all to see, but
oh too soon will fall to their knees
Sobbing uncontrollably, with such anxiety.
Quivering, not wanting to mix with society
Out of their shell, they crawl in early morn
To show a facade that can be adored
The truth must not prevail, what life really
does entail.
Their fear of truth must never be told.
It is a secret, hidden deep within the soul.
The bearer will endure much pain and sorrow
and ponder of hiding again tomorrow
