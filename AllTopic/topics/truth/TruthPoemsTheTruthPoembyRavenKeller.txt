Theres no sense in running
You cant hide from the nightmare forever
Don't you feel the breathe of death?
Don't you understand that you'll never get better?
Can you feel the world watching?
Accusing eyes, plotting your demise
Can you tell that no ones listening?
No gentle hand, to help you stand
Learn to laugh when you're fading
Learn to lie when you're in pain
Learn to smile when you're drowning
Learn to be pretend when you're no longer sane
