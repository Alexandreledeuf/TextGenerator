To see, or not to see, that is the problem;
Whether 'tis easier in this life to suffer
The barbs and jabs of unthinking citizens,
Or to marshal your forces against your foes,
And by resisting stop them? To struggle to weep;
No more; and by struggle to say to assuage
The heartache and the thousand inward struggles
That man is heir to, 'tis culmination
Fervently to be desired. To struggle to weep;
To weep; maybe to think: ay, there's the rub;
For in the weeping that drowns the sorrow
When you succumb to life here on earth,
Must present our cause; There's truth's impact
That makes chaos of so long a life;
For who is left to bear the taunts and jibes of time,
The abuser of power, the educators pleas,
The pangs of trampled truth, the endless trails,
The decisions in smoke filled rooms and the cries
Of those unworthy to think.
Truth will out! Truth will out!
But what is to be, will be.
Just what is transpiring at the Congressional level in our government! I thought that this poem might be worth considering.
