Truth is like the brilliant Sun,
Opens its bright orange eyes,
Heralding a dawn,
A fresh day,
A new revelation!
Truth is like the golden Sun,
Shines without any reservations,
Never hiding nor holding back,
Revealing to the world its mighty power,
Sprinkling its golden yellow rays into the world!
Truth is like the marvellous Sun,
Ever ready to spill out its generous,
Powerful light energy,
Publishing its mysterious vocabulary,
Into the books of earth's mystical wonders.
