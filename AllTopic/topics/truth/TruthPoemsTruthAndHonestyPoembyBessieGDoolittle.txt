What ever God does
Is honest and true
What ever you do
Should be too.
No matter how hard
It seems to be
Ask help, in Jesus name
And be honest in your heart.
Brothers and sisters in Christ
Truthful and honest
Trusting our Lord with all our hearts
As Jesus taught us,
Lean not to our own understanding.
Our faith worketh in Jesus love
His love for us, forevermore
We except it day to day
Hour by hour, how wonderful.
How wonderful we can ask
His will to be done, not thine or mine
How wonderful His love for us
Makes all things right and wonderful.
