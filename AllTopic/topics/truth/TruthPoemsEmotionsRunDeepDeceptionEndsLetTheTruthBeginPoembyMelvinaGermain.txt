Emotions Run Deep
Deep In The  Valley Of Pain.
I fear the pouring of  rain,
radiating deep within my soul
an emotion I can not hold.
Deception Ends
Peering into the depth of darkness,
leaving the light of stars behind.
Fearful moving in the wrong direction.
Lifeâ€™s quality was that of deception.
Let the truth begin
Skeletons hidden in the closet.
fills ones mind with uncertainty.
Release all evil lurking within.
Embrace love, let the truth begin
