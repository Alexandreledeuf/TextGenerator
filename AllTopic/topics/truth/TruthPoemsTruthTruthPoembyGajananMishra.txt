Truth, truth.
That is exactly
I want to know
Both in rain
and in sun.
For truth
I am loving you
Day in and
Day out.
I am dreaming
the truth,
Truth is the reality
of my life, and
Life's imagination.
How can I forget
the truth that is
within me?
I am the basis
of the truth.
Let us accept the truth
that is there already
before us.
Let us forget not
we are here only
for the wise words
of that truth.
Truth is not painful,
Truth is what we accept
and what we reject.
Truth, truth,
that is what
exactly I want to know.
