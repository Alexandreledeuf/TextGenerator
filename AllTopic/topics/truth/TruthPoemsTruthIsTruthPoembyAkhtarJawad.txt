Truth! I shall speak you if I am in habit of listening to you,
Truth! If the society in that I am living cannot listen to you, I shall remain silent.
Truth! I know you are bitter but I shall taste you,
Truth! You are a poisonous wine but I shall drink you.
Truth! If you are my dream bring a Joseph to interoperate it,
Truth! If you are Joseph's beloved I shall love dreaming you.
Truth! If you are love I am ready to die being insane for you,
Truth! I promise I shall not held you responsible for my death.
Truth! If you are a reality why you appear as a superstition?
Truth! Though I am your image but I shall not hide myself behind the screens of lies.
