Truth
Bounded to you by love
Separated from you by life
Young and foolish not able to see
To see, the truth that surrounds me
Pleasant playgrounds joyfully explored
Traitorous life foolishly ignored
Safe in your arms I felt nurtured
Pride in your eyes I felt accomplishment
Youth turning to independence
Innocence turning to experience
Ego ruling me, intoxicating my mind
Other peopleâ€™s favours turning my own
The Beginning of my hatred begun
Your choice, my responsibility
Neglection I choose to squander
Help is not for me to give
Cowardness enclosing my mind
Wanted safety banished from me
Betrayed by your needed love
Loneliness is burden to me
Haunted by you presence
Desperate to ease your pain
Impatience becoming a constant friend
Resignation is all I abide
Despite is all I feel
Love lost in unforgettable pain
Ruined is my life
If this is truth, ignorance I advise
