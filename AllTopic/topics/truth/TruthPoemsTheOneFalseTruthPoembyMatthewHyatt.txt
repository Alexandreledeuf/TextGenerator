The darkness surrounds me
fills the void and caresses my skin
encouraging me to rise and sin
my mind turns ashen and corrupts my thoughts
gossiping about would be not
I was once revered by the sick and the old
now all I have left is the cold
The darkness engulfs me
In my wake I drain happy thoughts
Leaving morals to sit and rot
dealing with those who would rather not.
'Your a monster' they say with a mob at their side
alone by themselves they would run and hide
A wake of destruction follows me by my stride
lands charred black, rivers boiled
The hard work of man soiled
My rise to the top is bloody and fast
The public knowing my reign will not last
Those who oppse are often bloodied
I have been extensively studied
The darkness becomes me
They fear me, hate me, want to destroy me
All because I took away their lives that were free
A bullet to the head,
I rise from the dead
Proclaimed as the one
Deeds like mine are rarely done
So begins my apocalyptic reign
I am the darness
