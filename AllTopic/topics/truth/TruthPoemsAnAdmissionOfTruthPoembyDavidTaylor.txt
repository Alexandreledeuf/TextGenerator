Now here’s a short poem
that I oft thought of showing.
A bit of a lark,
or a thing of the dark?
Above all an admission of truth.
Now I’ve joined you all here
for less than a year.
On this journey so dear,
of poems diverse and astute.
Of feelings sublime that sometimes do rhyme.
Of anger and angst, or a grievance to hoot.
Well I have to admit
that I sometimes do dream,
of the style and the wit,
to make you all swoon, and to gasp,
with each brilliant line that I’ve writ.
I think to myself in a self centred way,
what have I to say that can give,
you all an experience, you’ll never forget.
A verse so sublime
that never with time
will it loose its importance.
Not even in death!
Well if I find it I’m sure
you’ll be the first to endure
the full force of its eloquent depth.
But until then and for now the best I can do
is this sorry attempt, at a poem with serious intent.
And if it cannot aspire to set you on fire,
I hope that at least you’re content.
And perhaps, well maybe, you have to admit,
there’s a poem, or two, you wish you had writ.
