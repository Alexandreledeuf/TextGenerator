The thorns of a rose
Distract not from its beauty,
But causes the hand
To caress with tenderness,
And offer so carefully
To the recipient
The petals
And the pricks.
Such is the nature of truth
For itâ€™s glory is beautiful, no doubt,
But can cause the hearer to wince
Lest with love and light
'Tis offered betwixt.
