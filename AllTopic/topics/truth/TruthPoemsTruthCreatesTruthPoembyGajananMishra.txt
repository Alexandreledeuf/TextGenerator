What is created is also truth
There is nothing but truth
Truth sustains truth
What is sustained is also truth
There is nothing but truth
Truth never destroys
What is destroyed is not truth
There is nothing but truth
Truth is only here there
Everywhere as you see as I observe
And you see truth as I see truth
And truth is the light of all lights.
