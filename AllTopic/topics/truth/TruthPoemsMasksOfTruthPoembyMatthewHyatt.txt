I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
Cast off the masks and let emotions fly
Let the false self die
Hear the sound of the falling rain
The rain to cleanse the brain
Everyone has a mask
To perform a different task
Hiding misery, regret, and pain
With a forced smile or gleam
Hoping it's only a bad dream
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
