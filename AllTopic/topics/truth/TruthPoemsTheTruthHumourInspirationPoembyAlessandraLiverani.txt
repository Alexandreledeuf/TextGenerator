Tell the truth, are you crazy, the truth is for fools
In my clever world it’s lying which rules
Why opt for something as silly as sincerity
When you can easily choose dishonesty
Then you can tell lies upon lies upon lies
So many out there for you to devise
And believe them yourself, very nearly, why not
You weaved such an interesting, exciting plot
The truth, big deal, the truth is nothing but lies
My truth’s so much better, at least in my eyes
My lies versus the truth, so easy to win
Because I can keep lying ad nauseum
I’ll just spout out a lie, how easy was that
Don’t look for the truth in my kind of chat
You think I’ll be discovered, I’m way too smart
I’ll never say what’s there in my heart
My heart was stunted a long time ago
All this lying stopped any chance it could grow
When you don’t speak from your heart, it’s hard to see
The difference between truth and dishonesty
