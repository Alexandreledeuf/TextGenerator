Since time immemorial man lives in harmony with Nature;
But with the scientific inventions and technological progress
Man has slowly drifted from his habit due to domination of
Profit motive of commercial interests spreading far and wide!
Modernization of nations and coming of civilization sans
Touch with human culture have disturbed the course of Nature
Leading to climate changes bringing long droughts and heavy
Cyclonic wind and rain flooding many nations frequently now!
Not bothering about recycling of natural resources in his hurry
In exploiting Nature for raw materials, fuels and foods, man has
Brought upon himself the wrath of Nature that balances itself
With drastic measures by bringing hottest days and biting winters!
Unless man changes his attitude and way of living in harmony
With Nature all things can't be set right to normalcy forever....!
