I find it impossible to understand
How greed and power destroy nations
How its left carry on unabated
People power has to call a halt
The media owned by multinationals
Feed us with what we want to hear
Oil companies don't want competition
Going green is not to them an option
In Ireland a government was defeated
For trying to privatise their water
People there fighting the big boys
Setting an example all over Europe
