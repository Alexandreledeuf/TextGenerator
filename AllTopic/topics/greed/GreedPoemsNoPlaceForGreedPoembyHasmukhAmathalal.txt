No place for greed
Sunday,27th May 2018
let there remain harmony
and not treat people poorly
they are in need
so there is no place for the greed
your country was the jewel in the past
the great culture that remained till last
the greedy men are all over the world
only miseries are there for them to be told
Dear countrymen of the land
consider no one as a friend
when they are doing nonsense
and make the people tense
yes, they lived with luxury
and this added to the poverty
people remained starved
and many died
Let wars are not waged
and people tied and caged
this is cruel treatment
and shameful act at present
the whole of the world may witness
and face
the wrath of the people
who will come out and revolt
