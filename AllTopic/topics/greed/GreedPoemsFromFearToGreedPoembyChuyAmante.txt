There is love and fear
only two diving boards
Guess which gives and
guess who hoards?
From FEAR stems
a survival instinct
Reason soon leaves,
reaction- no think
Fearful they are of death
and the end
Grab all they can
and try to defend
When death's illusion
dies rattling
There will be
cessation of battling
We'll never run out,
there is more than enough
Go with abundant flow
it's really not tough
Drop the body
when it is time
fly the heck outward,
the real YOU, sublime
