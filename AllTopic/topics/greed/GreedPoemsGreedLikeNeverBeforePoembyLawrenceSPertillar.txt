Like never before.
Ever before.
Just to feed the greed of elites.
Just to feed the greed of elites.
Religion and politics,
Are more in the mix today.
Using God to start conflicts.
And doing this at their benefit.
Like never before.
Just to feed the greed of elites.
Leaving people everywhere to weep.
Leaders of hypocrisy.
For profits pocketed to not be ended.
Creating enemies to distract.
A misreading of their thieving acts.
Just to feed the greed of elites.
Like never before.
With a doing to make more people poor.
People are scammed into mayhem.
By fanatics using politics.
And those claiming faith to bait,
As tools to deceive them quick to trick...
Into conflicts!
Just to keep the feeding of elites.
Leaders of hypocrisy.
Religious and political fanatics.
Profiting to pocket and deceiving,
People left on knees to weep.
Like never before.
To not end.
Like never before.
