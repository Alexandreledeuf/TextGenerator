I spread my greed as a tree  spreads  its root
Deep and wide into the ground, straight
To suck upon the sap with its  tip
And send it directly to the  leaf
More I go deep more I get
More sap I get more gets me greed
Behind all of my troubles cause  is the root
The result of my misdeeds   blooms
Into a flower and hangs from every shoot
I bear the suffering as the tree  bears  the fruit
