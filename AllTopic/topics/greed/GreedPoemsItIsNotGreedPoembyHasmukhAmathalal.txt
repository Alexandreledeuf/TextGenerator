That feeds
Alone for some ideas
To request as “please’
“Pick the pen” mind activates
“If object found on read” and elates
Such is the common greed
Rampant in human mind indeed
We re taught
Rather caught
With wrong philosophy
And alter on feel pity
Mind one thing
It is related to something
Any ill gotten thing takes away
Double the value of item in any way
Accept the bribe of any kind
That shall make you restless and blind
You will be filled with arrogance
That money may not allow you peace at once
We have habituated it as normal
Not objected to any time on arrival
We shall accept as if it is blessings
But mind that it is enough for downing
It shakes whole foundation
It makes you corrupt and puts big question
You see gain in each effort
That prevails ship from reaching port
