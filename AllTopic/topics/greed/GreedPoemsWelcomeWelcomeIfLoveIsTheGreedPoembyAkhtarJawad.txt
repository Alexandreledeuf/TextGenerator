As long as his dreams are alive,
Sure, he has a fair chance to survive,
He is moving on a dangerous track,
Why she is shouting, "He is a crack."
Why her eyes are wet, is it love?
He knows, he doesn't fly like a dove,
He knows it's a rope not a bridge,
The teen aged girl is standing on a ridge.
But his eyes are on her pink gown
He, a lover, who never looks down
Journey of his eyes from feet to face
Kissing and embracing her silky grace
It's the midway and his eyes are at rest
To get back his breaths the spot is the best
Looking into his eyes why she is shy?
Prayers for her lover! Looking at the sky!
The same crazy in disciplined naughty boy!
Different metals, can they form an alloy?
May be; love is a magic, a force a might
Anytime can change the wrong in the right
He's close to the heart, a valley to adore
Listen to the beats climb more, climb more
Here he is, he can see her dancing hips
Hands round the neck, lips on the lips!
Writing and stamping a wordless deed
Welcome, welcome if love is the greed!
