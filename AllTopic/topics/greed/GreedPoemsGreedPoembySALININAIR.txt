End of life was in tune
Melody that swings somewhere
Strange mind swish a hope
I need a shoulder to cry on
Long years of solitude
Awed ways that marched lonely
Plead for love in empty corners
Thrash that hooked in vagueness of life
Find love in a deserted corner
Hug it with the disastrous wings
As death admired as its part
Greed of love that sinks itself
Death is a mentor of life and love
Span that wait to seize its spark
Moves to its mouth with empty hands
Contracted love that lilt always
Plea for love is the greatest deed
String that lies in bottom of heart
Sometimes unknown or ignore
But hurts as its greed……
