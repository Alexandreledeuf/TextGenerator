Of Human greed in these tough times we read of and we hear
Company C E O's not paid in thousands but in millions every year
Yet few of their type known for to help anyone in poverty
In a World where some have too much so much inequality
So many wealthy people from our Earth Mother take and take
From her precious resources their fortunes they do make
Her gold, silver and precious minerals, her uranium and coal
The more they have the more they want their greed out of control
For abusing the one we live off of the price may be huge to pay
Of droughts and famines caused by Climate Change we read and hear of every day
For the curse of Global Warming human greed in part to blame
Our abuse of our Earth Mother is only to our shame
The World is getting warmer from north to southern shore
And the greedy from our Earth Mother keep on stealing more and more.
