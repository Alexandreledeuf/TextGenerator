Although America did not invent greed
It certainly made renovations when it purchased that institute
And gave it gaudiness attractive for a car salesman;
No other empire in the world can lay claim to being founded
On the principals of debt, Credit Ratings and Insurance Premiums
As a vehicle to facilitate global supremacy in the economic markets
There's know other country in the world who puts a higher price in freedom
Then America who sells it for a good premium quid pro quo
Infidelity is the beneficiary
Of the capitalistic spirit
Perhaps the Romans would have survived
Had they invested in a credit line
