Greed is such a simple word
Yet rob so many of what they heard
The more you give the more it takes
And does not care even when it aches
Since no one checks what you make
It presents itself with such discreet
You may be mistaken and think it is neat
It demands very little at the start
Just wait until it settles in your heart
And dictates how subtly you can start
The more you get the more you want
And you find you canâ€™t wait to start
You begin to cheat when others retreat
And learn to carry it out on the street
Not knowing you are aiming for defeat
When greed gets sweet you get in more deep
Makes you such a thief you can hardly sleep
You try to be wise with your smart compromise
Little do you know that your boss in disguise
Knows your scheme and planed otherwise
Business he knows seldom will grow
When greed sets in and gives it a blow
Wisdom demands to weather the storm
Confront and disarm before any alarm
Deal with the issue and avoid any harm
Shame on your name brings you pain
Greed can only give you earthly gain
Check out your motive before you defame
You have given talent kept it from stain
Ask for forgiveness and settle the claim
