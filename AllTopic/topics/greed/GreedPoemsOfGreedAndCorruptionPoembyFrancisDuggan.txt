Of greed and corruption we are all too aware
It's happening in your suburb and the big World out there
Many in high places into corporate crime
And more honorable than them in jail serving time
On the scales of justice one must cast a doubt
Big time corporate crims seldom ever caught out
Money speaks every language some are known to say
In the twenty first century it does seem that way
Of greed and corruption the whispers abound
Amongst influential people criminals to be found
To buy their way out of trouble they seldom do fail
The power of their money can keep them from jail
And of greed and corruption we hear every day
Whoever did tell us that crime does not pay?
