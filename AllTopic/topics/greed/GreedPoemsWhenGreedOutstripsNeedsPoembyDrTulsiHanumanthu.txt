When Greed Outstrips Needs (A Rondel of 13 lines)
When outstripped are our needs by Greed
Or love of Fame our still outweighs,
We rush along on mirky ways;
All moral laws we cease to heed.
Traffic signals failing to read,
At break-neck speed our aims we chase,
When outstripped are our needs by Greed
Or love of Fame our skill outweighs.
To harming others should this lead,
So what?  For Fame so strong our craze,
The banner 'buy or bribe' we raise!
We mind not making others bleed,
When outstripped are our needs by Greed.
