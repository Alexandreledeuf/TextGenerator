Limited is the need,
Unlimited is the greed,
Engaged in misdeed,
I ignore your bleed.
Two pieces of cloth and a piece of bread,
Can keep me alive, I'll not be dead,
Shelter of a roof not touching the sky,
I can walk with feet don't need to fly.
But I want the greed,
How dire is the need,
Of a peace making deed,
See the painful bleed.
Peace of hearts and peace brains,
I should have it, no refrains,
Unlimited is this need,
And limited is my greed.
