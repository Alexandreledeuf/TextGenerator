The history of Earth dates back to millions of years ago,
When a perfect engineer, ‘the God’, created this world.
He made life in forms of plants and animals,
And for all gave them Earth - the abode.
The plants and animals lived in ideal harmony,
And there was no trace of agony.
Everybody sought merely what was required,
Nothing superfluous anybody acquired.
The man came at the end
And learnt expeditious for himself to fend.
Soon he realized the powers he had,
And it drove him nearly mad.
For others he had no regard,
With nature he remained forever at odds.
He amassed much more than needed,
“Be Cautious” - the nature pleaded.
Soon the environment was left degraded.
Animals and plants slowly faded.
Towards catastrophe the world headed,
And hasty correction was severely needed.
Mercifully, man has now realized,
The world has sufficient for everyone’s’ need
But if overexploited
It would succumb to man’s greed.
Today he is trying to reverse the cycle
By protecting Mother Nature so vital.
Almighty forgive mistakes of your creation
And give him strength for positive action
To prevent this world from extinction.
AMEN
