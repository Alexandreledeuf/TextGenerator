In the past we felt there was a need for greed
we felt that in order to make it and succeed
we had to win, we had to compete
winning was all, not minding the heat.
But there is a new vision of life:
It involves kindness without strife
we want to share our time and all things
and enjoy the sheer happiness it brings
There is no feeling good in abuse and greed
No joy in the feeling of an ever increasing need,
If we cannot change our old views of success
we 'll forever chase but never achieve happiness
Soon greed will survive only in a small minority
since more and more of us start seeing the superiority
of practicing kindness love and simply sharing
of living a life filled with compassion and caring
There are some old typists who still want to use
only old typewriters since computers, they refuse
There are still people clinging to greed and division
not willing to accept life's new kindness filled vision.
Obviously old typewriters are absolutely obsolete
Soon this will be true also for the stupidity of greed
We will all value that happiness and peace of mind
only originates from love, sharing and being kind.
