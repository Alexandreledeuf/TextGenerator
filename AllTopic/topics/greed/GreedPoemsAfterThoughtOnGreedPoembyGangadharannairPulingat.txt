Humans always in craze for wealth
For accumulation of wealth he runs fast
The thorny ways, deep pits and hills
No matter what becomes to his soul
The greed always shuts the divine ways
Slowly it becomes the habit
No matter what others sees in him
The material enjoyment he prefer always
The charity to the needy for namesake
Greed destroys the wise character
The greedy seeks the way of narrowness
Where ultimately it is self destruction
The destruction of the humanness
When in ultimate reality awakens him
He is on the horns of dilemma, that hounds
Only legitimate creative action saves
To lead a comfortable life of enjoyment.
