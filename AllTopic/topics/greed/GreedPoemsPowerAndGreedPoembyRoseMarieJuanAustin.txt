Some of us think they are too powerful
They can smash the mountain
They can divide the ocean
They can control the flight of the clouds in the sky
They can align night and day.
Some of us think they can manipulate
The hands of time
And people's minds
Taking all the great opportunities
Leaving nothing for others.
Their misdeeds will follow them
Cling onto their lives
The hands of time
Will run after them
And exact payment
More of what they claimed.
