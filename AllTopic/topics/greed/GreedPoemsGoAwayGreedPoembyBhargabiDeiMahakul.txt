You are unseen but also captured
In minds of many you are featured,
You divert the child well nurtured,
On grazing by you animals are pastured.
Watching the innocent baby new born
You wait and hide to catch with turn,
While child grows little you blow horn
He starts telling things are my in morn.
You are just like colour changing lizard,
You fill in man really negative wizard.
In minds of many you do bring blizzard,
Fishes and birds enter food to gizzard.
By getting you animals loose a steer,
Birds fly with tending to fall with fear,
They fall in confusion who live in sheer,
You motivate for crime and sticks smear.
You do spoil life oh go away oh greed
People fight for hand of land, and seed.
Please do not stay for negative breed,
People are with God now and in creed.
