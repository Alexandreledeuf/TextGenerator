Spat out of the mouth of Satan
Comes forth a needy demon
With desires exploding
Out of proportion
On the souls of selfish Victims
His ambitions forgets good morals
Hunger fuel in rage
Passion burns insane
His thirst should be quench
Craving fed, yeaning comforted
Give him more, give him more!
His hunger is driving him insane
His thirst must always be quench!
Yearnings well comforted!
Give him more! give him more
Even if he takes his victims to hell
His hunger will never be fed!
