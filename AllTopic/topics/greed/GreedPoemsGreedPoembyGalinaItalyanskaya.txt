Catch the sun
And lock into the cell
To offer it for sale…
Guy, you're still not happy.
Make a sound,
Declare: ‘It is mine,
So you can buy it here,
But do not dare to copy! '
Let your thought
Be signed as solely yours,
Certificated, patented
To fill your bank account.
You forgot,
If you have ever known,
Guy, what you really own
Is what you care about.
One can swear
The land belongs to him,
And he can build his firm,
He has all needed papers.
He's a liar.
He only takes and leaves
Polluted air and rivers,
Exhausted soil and people.
When your heart
Looks for another heart,
It tries to reach the stars,
It sings to someone dear.
Does it hurt,
If songs are spread for free?
Is that your only creed
To sell and never share?
Tell me if
It came across your mind:
Your greed would make you blind,
Your greed would make you poor.
You believe
That wealth is worth your soul.
Thus you will mute its song
For sure.
