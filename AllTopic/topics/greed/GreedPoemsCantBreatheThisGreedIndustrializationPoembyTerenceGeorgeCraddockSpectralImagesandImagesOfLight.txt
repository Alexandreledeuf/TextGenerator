atmosphere

carbon dioxide
atmosphere provide
for plants animals
seal in an ecosystem
atmosphere
guardian part
of water cycle
complex interactions
elements in atmosphere
without atmosphere
there would
be possible
no life at all
give me a little
of my God given air
of my God created air
give me a little
so i may breathe in renewed
complex wonder of creation
pollution sticks in my throat
burns eyes throat burns
mankind is burning creation
can’t breathe this
greed
industrialization
give
me less greenhouse
gases
earth pump
as God created
engineered
give me
a little
clean air
