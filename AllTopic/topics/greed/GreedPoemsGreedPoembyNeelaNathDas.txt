Let me dive into the
crystal water of the
river which flows by
the side of the blue
hill and deep woods.
I wish to play with the
fish swimming in the
shiny water under the
sun-gifted pure light.
I want to touch the
wings of the birds
flying high in the sky
without grief or sorrow.
I love to sip from
the cup of Nature
and lie with the
grasses beneath tree.
I have greed for the
best part of this world.
So, set me free from
the greed of human society.
