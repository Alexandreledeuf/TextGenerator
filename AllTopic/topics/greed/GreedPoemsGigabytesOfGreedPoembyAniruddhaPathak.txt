Oh this vain world, gigabytes of greed seized,
With more ever the more, less and less pleased,
Pitted as is with marginal returns,
A goods train of greed trudging on loose tracks
Truth paying tithe to logic it much lacks,
From need to greed, to coveting when turns,
The vulture1 vies when voracity kissed.
And lo, if greed on wings falls way behind,
Forget if learned lament recession,
The world would fairly well-off itself find,
Call it a benign cooling of passion,
Dampening of red greed and blas√© desire,
That fueled markets to a raging fire,
O at last on a greed-starved way to wind
In a world void of vultures with greed blind.
