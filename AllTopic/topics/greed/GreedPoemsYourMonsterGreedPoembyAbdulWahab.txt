One you bought
A beautiful one
I know the second one
You bought with much hardship
You could not get the third one
Even with hardship
But you strongly desired it
So you picked it up
Now you are under my supervision
Under my captivation
I kindle a fire
Of more and more
I am the fuel myself
And help it to burn
I live on it
And it is my staple food, too
Even if you wish
You would not be able to douse it
I would prevent you
Even to meet with peace
Then I would drive
Your happiness out
Who are you to talk like this?
I am no one but your monster greed.
