I established lead
But failed to read
What was actual need?
To cater friends and feed
I got simple answer
The key lies with fewer
It is sweet coated offer
With clear aim to differ
I am number one greedy person
I make relation for selfish reasons
Greed is rampant in mind
So I act very kind
Greed shall pay dividend
And bring happy end
But I am mistaken
The peace, in turn, shall be mistaken
I shall die as unhappy man
Considered not fit to be human
It shall or should remain endeavor
I shall die hungry but not with greed or dishonor
