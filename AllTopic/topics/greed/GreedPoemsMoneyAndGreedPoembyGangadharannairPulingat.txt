A man of prosperity
He was having dexterity
Enough he earned in money
Little he gave to the needy
Or relative and friends
Those who were very poor
Even to his kith and kin.
He prospered in such speed
Together he was in greed
For money and gold gained
But still unhappy and bad mood
No one was devoted to him
Even his best half in dejection
Still he loved his money
All was well for years
Hypnotized on influence of money
Delectable events slowly lost
He became ill for ever
Even to drink water difficult
Swallow food was not easy
The day came, his death time
People says his eyes were not closed
May be looking for money
The safety notions in thoughts
Even the last moments of journey.
