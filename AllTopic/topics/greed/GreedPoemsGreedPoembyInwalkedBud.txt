The world's wrapped up in politics and loves big finance too
I find it quite depressing in large quantities, it's true
It's good to have the knowledge, and to know what's going on
But when it starts to rule the world, then everything goes wrong
There's so much hate out in this world, It's such a crying shame
People pointing fingers and so quick to place the blame
Intolerant of others, and unwilling to diffuse
With sociopaths in charge, war is always in the news
I wish that we could coexist, respect our fellow man
Quit hating other ways of life that we don't understand
But in politics and finance, war profiteering, grows and thrives
Yes, it's all about the money, not at all about the lives
I am not apathetic, I just can't stand it any more
I do not wish to witness so much suffering and war
If I focus on the travesty of all thats going down
I can not breathe, I suffocate, my spirit starts to drown
