The money greed is not a simple greed.
Yes! One needs money to live,
Only to live a contented life,
Not to get wrapped in avarice.
The greed that envelops
To hoard and collect,
To possess much more than one needs,
Verily, is money greed!
Avarice for possessions is
A serious habitual trait,
A grave hindrance,
To the practice of 'Ahimsa'!
A fanatic desire for material goods,
To acquire more and more,
By fair or foul means,
Leads one astray!
Accumulating, enveloping oneself with
Innumerable goods, articles and structures,
Leads to much confusion,
Leaves little place for vital air!
To stand or sit -
Does one require much space?
To sleep on a bed -
Does one need more than a few square feet?
Do we ever think or reflect?
How much space we require when we die,
To be buried or to be burnt?
Just a bare strip of earth!
Yet, we forget this fact,
We continue in our material pursuits,
Ever greedy and avaricious,
Hounded by hundreds of things!
We spend our quality life
Pursuing money and material!
In this race of life,
Does â€˜Ahimsa' ever figure?
On the contrary,
In the pursuit of pleasures,
It is infliction of pain, misery,
Careless and callous!
