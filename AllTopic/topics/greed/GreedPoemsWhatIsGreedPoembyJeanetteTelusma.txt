Greed is black in color.
It is selfish in every aspect.
It is normally one sided in nature.
It's glory is only for a moment.
It is like a deflating balloon.
It eventually catches up, watch.
Greed is dark.
It thinks only of itself.
It is very imbalanced.
It's happiness is fleeting.
It gets real small in size.
The seeds sown will soon reap a harvest.
