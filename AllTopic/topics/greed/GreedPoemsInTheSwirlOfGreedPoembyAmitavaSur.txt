Knowledge teaches us
How much  is our need
Vices inundate
In the swirl of greed.
Increasing knowledge
Lessens the needs
Guides the  soul
Towards wisdom and  peace
Vices are like
Cancerous germs
Increases the greed
To destroy oneself.
Goal of life
Is to attain love and peace
With greed
We can never reach that place.
Greed is
Like a hunting trap
It allures, attracts
And ruins at last.
Increasing knowledge
Lessens the needs
Guides the a soul
Towards wisdom and  peace
