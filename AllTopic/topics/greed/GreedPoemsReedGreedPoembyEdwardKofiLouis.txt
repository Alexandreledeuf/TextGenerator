Reed, greed!
Greed like a pride is the curse of mankind;
Purse, curse!
And to buttress our inalienable rights.
Stress, buttress!
But, i am dressed like a school boy waiting for my teacher;
However, realistic is my name.
Feed, heed!
And, you are dressed like a school girl on my love;
But, in truthfulness is the eloquence of your muse.
Note, wrote!
But, the pride of greediness is the curse of mankind.
