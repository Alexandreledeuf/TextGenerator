A gun in the hand, a bomb in a bag,
Hundred lives, hundred souls in death to drag;
Amidst a square, where families come to play,
At a train station, at a club, night or day;
No one is safe, ask those who survived the blast,
No one knows how much more the shooting will last,
Yet from all I see this I know to be true,
No God, nor yours nor mine, could ever order,
Such pain and such tears, such a gruesome slaughter,
Nor crave for others' blood, nor show such a hate,
I see human greed put religion for bait;
I see men and women dying for a cause,
That knows no borders, nor obeys to our laws.
Alas! This hatred must now find an end
Alas! Let no more lives to be lost and spent
Alas! Listen not to the words of those few
Who thought lives don't matter, lying is what they do;
Open your eyes and for once just stand and see,
Monsters are born as strong as they could be,
You know them well, you've seen them many times before,
They aren't called Religion, nor Race, nor War;
No soul, no mind, they cause innocents to bleed,
These monsters only have one name and that's Greed!
