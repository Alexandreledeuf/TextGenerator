As you grow up in this world,
the facts and stories that were untold slowly unfold.
You are forced to bear a lot of pain
and you just can't complain.
Your endurance is repeatedly put to a test
and you just can't protest.
You are left wounded at the end of each day
and nobody is bothered while you bleed.
When this human heart is devoid of love and filled with greed! ! !
