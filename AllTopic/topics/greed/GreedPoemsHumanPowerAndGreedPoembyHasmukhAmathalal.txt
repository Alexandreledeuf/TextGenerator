Human power and greed
Saturday,28th September 2019
What makes them bloodthirsty?
when they try to spread the hegemony
over the poor country
and manage control over the economy
nothing works
when greed exceeds
national interest is compromised
nothing goes as promised
it is a mad arms race
and worst scene if faced
innocent lives are put at stake
no one is in position to apply the brake
the world may face another risk
upon receiving the kick
in the form of threats
and it shall turn into the war theatre
no one has to cry
only humanity has to be given a try
the precious lives are to be saved
and the world community has to sensibly behave
