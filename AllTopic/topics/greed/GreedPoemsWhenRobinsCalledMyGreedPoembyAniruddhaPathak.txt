Through windows' widely open frame
Two robins once to my house came
And surveyed everything they saw,
I watched them whilst with wide-eyed awe.
From one corner to the farther,
And from sitting room to the â€˜ther,
Flying from ceiling fan to fan,
Wondering on greed of a man!
Why on earth they need such big nest?
She seemed to tell to her boy friend,
I don't think they expect new guest,
We as do our chicks this month end.
Wonder if we can our modest
Nest build inside their sprawling nest.
Stop building castles in thin air,
He said: tree's fine for us and fair.
