Greed is certainly a disease                                          That is risky, absurd, and gloomy                                     Simply because it makes someone on                                    The wrong path all his life...                                       It kills one's inner feelings and                                     One's pretty emotions anytime...                                     There is only that distrust between                                   The greedy behavior of a sick person                                  Who looks only for his selfish benefit anytime and others...                    Greed itself is the biggest evil ever                                 Simply because it kills that pretty spirit                            Inside us anytime, anywhere, and everywhere.                         _________________________________________________ _____________________
