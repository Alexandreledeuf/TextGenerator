I dream a scene
Where a baby falls asleep
Having sucked a pair of breasts
Resembling two pomegranates weighing ten kg.
I desire a blue sky
Which is not adulterated
By vulture-like coquettishly killing planes.
And, o my Love,
I bear the inborn greed
To stare at you in the open corridor of life
By sitting thousand years together.
