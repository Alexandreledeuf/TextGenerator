This is what many fall in trap of it is greed
For many desires it originates does breed.
Seed is the attachment towards all matters,
For wealth, money or food it always flatters.
This is a vice originates from a clumsy mind,
Nobody understands it opens branch in wind.
Like spreading of spider's web it does catch,
Person who falls in its clause does not fetch.
Many do crime falling in love of greed here,
People get tortured by them and get fear.
They bear fruits of sins as do in greed later,
Even they do not like to leave know better.
It is truly said sins are acquired from greed,
Sins with bondage take towards death seed.
Richer to richest fall down and commit crime,
Greedy persons think only wealth is the prime.
Not only the greed brings sorrow but also pain,
Due to capture of illusion, wrong things we gain.
Matters are the motivators and are cause of sad,
Greed is a deadly vice pauses life and really is bad.
Greed goes away while we all do meditate God,
Mind stabilizes rules over senses catches pod.
Greed nods before pure mind and leaves place
By grace of God we gain purity and win the race.
