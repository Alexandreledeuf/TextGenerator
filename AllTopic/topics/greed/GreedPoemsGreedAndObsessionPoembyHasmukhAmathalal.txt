Greed and obsession
Money has lot more roles to play
And hold sway
Over men's desire
To remain admired
It creates position
When relatively found good relation
Consolidated enough clout
And talked about
Not only have you become greedy
But get ready
To perform any thing
That is unworthy of something
People resort to murder
When find no means to alter
Economic condition
And social position
So prosperity has become yardstick
With strict
Inclination and possession
And obsession too
