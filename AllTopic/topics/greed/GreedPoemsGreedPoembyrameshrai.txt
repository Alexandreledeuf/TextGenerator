Greed  is  fire
its flare is strong
as much as to burn
all commodities
from heaven to hell
it has no end
it is never saturated
nor it is ever quenched
it can kill spontaneously
any living kind
never does it mind
justice, sin and always blind
they are curse for this world
they never repent on their deed.
