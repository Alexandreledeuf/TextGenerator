Greed is a twin of graveyard
Its never says enough
Never ever filled to the brim
Its never contented
Greed is voluptuous
Always quest for self alone
Like vultures haunting for caracass
Greed is restless for more
Ever tight-fisted
Ever wanting to amass more
Till it becomes bloated
With materials unneedful
Always seeking vanity
Until its labour is naught
