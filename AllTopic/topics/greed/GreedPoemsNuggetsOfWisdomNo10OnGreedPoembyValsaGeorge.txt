Greed of all kinds, specially for power nâ€™ pelf
Drive men to play many a mischief
It enters our world like an invisible elf
Making one demean his esteemed self
Greed is like an uncontrolled steed
It might gallop in reckless speed
Any time it can kick you down to bleed
Sometimes even causing a stampede
Running after wealth is often a wild chase
The snobbish, wealth can easily entice
Often they have to pay a heavy price
For greed generates greed and many a vice
Money is seen by some as master and Lord
And they compete, everyday to hoard
Even if a lot of wealth is procured
Alas, one never feels fully secured
The root cause of many a malady is greed
We witness the ills, it does everyday breed
Minimize the wants and focus only on the need
Thus from monstrous greed, let us be freed
