Greediness for sensual pleasures -
Most obnoxious and low!
A man becomes a brute
When he follows
His base, animal instinct!
He chases the evil which secretly resides
Within himself!
He knows no better
Than his treacherous passions
And to awaken the immoral mind!
When the mind focuses only on sex,
He becomes a slave of undesirable passions!
His mind refuses to think,
His brain negates reason,
He loses his sense of balance,
And above all,
He wastes his vital force,
The power of the universe,
The wonderful vitality,
Lost in immoral actions!
Sexual misconduct like rape is a grave sin!
It becomes unpardonable,
When forced upon,
Or brutally imposed upon on an innocent soul!
A sexual misdemeanour is
The most horrifying act,
An act of grave violence,
To be condemned!
For a sexual pervert â€˜Ahimsa' is
Totally alien and incomprehensible!
