because politics by
nature is greedy
voters conclude
election must be based
on greediness
when election is based on
greediness
politicos and voters are
both happy
becoming more greedy
politicos buy
voter's suffrage rights
voters sell their rights
to cast wise votes
when both parties
the politicos and voters
are busy in buying and selling
the sacredness and sanctity of the votes
then Philippine politics is
ever evil and dirty
