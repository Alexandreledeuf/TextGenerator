With pain in neck he walked around,
all alone with just a frown.
All he wanted was there,
but reaching it seemed unfair.
All he wanted to do, he could,
But always wondered if he should.
What could he do with all his money?
all his expensive belongings seemed funny.
He had a mansion, garden a car,
but all the love was really far.
With pain in neck he walked around,
all alone with just a frown.
He deserved it, he totally did,
it was all because of his greed.
A young man, when he was,
he never even tried to measure his loss.
Now creeps him a pain,
when his dungeon walls are old and stained.
His billion pounds now have no use,
all he has lost, now what is there to loose?
With pain in neck he walked around,
all alone with just a frown.
