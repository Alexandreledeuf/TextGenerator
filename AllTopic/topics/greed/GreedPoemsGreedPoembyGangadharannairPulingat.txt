The predecessors of humans lived in forests
The hunter gatherers they fought with nature and wild
But seldom they destroyed the wild, flora and fauna
In such vast terms of events the world witnessing.
They killed the animals for food and skins
And also to protect themselves from their attacks
But we the civilized ones opted it for pleasure
For making money out of the ill gotten ways
By continuing the killing spree as poachers.
The bison, wild boars, elephants, and tigers
The king of wild the Lion, and the hippos
The rhenos, sambars, and beautiful other wildlife
Slowly and purposely destructing by fire arms
In fact the human being acts as the destiny makers
Of all the wild life which is to be objected.
This beautiful world and forests are entitled to all
For the humans as well as the wildlife we know
Save the world from perishes and protect the wildlife
As well as the forest which have immense wealth
Not only for today or tomorrow but upto the infinite time.
keep away from the greed and make us contented.
