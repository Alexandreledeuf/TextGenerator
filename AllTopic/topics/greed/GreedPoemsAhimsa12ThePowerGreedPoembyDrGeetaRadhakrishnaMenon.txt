The most vicious and dangerous
Is the power greed!
This stems from an enormous
Ego!
Not an ordinary sized ego
But much, much bigger than
A mountain!
It is not like a solid structure either
Because an ego keeps growing
And expanding,
Moving and leaping
Into gigantic proportions!
It seldom diminishes,
It is like a balloon filled with helium,
Bloating and floating high in space!
The power greed stems from the
"I" sense.
Not the simple,
"I am the owner of this house"
But the notoriety of
"I want to be the owner of this earth."
The power greed is never satisfied,
It asks for things, again and again.
The greed plans the strategies,
As how one could be crowned as
The Dictator!
To be dreadfully important,
Powerfully holding everything under the thumb,
Not just people or countries,
But Mother Earth too!
All along the way,
Of becoming a powerful emperor,
The greedy pursuits are accompanied
By various ‘Himsas'!
Each thought, word, or deed
Is a game plan,
To cut and wipe out,
Annihilate and destroy,
The innocent ones!
When each cell of the body
Pulsates with power greed,
How can ‘Ahimsa' be practised?
To demolish the power-greed
One has to scorch the seed of
The violent and powerful ‘I'!
