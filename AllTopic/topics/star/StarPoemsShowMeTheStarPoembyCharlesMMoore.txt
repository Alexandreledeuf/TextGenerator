Show me the star
and I'll show you the lover
for lovers they oft speak
of stars and of moons
passed down through the years
from mother to daughter
and father to son
these words make a heart swoon
And so it remains
in this love of a game
that starlight and moonlight
are not something new
I fear we've learned nothing
but then did we have to
for moonlight and starlight
still do what they do.
