'star light star bright'
eons passed by
into earth's womb
sunk into oceans
diluted into galaxies
and you're the same
'twinkle twinkle
little star...'
when the ancient me
roamed the length and breadth
of the expanding space
and intriguing earth
you were the one guiding me
now with not much wonder
left in life
earth bound woes
never allowing a gaze
'spent and tired'
night after night
i dissolve into
the dark spaces
you traverse
before you shine
