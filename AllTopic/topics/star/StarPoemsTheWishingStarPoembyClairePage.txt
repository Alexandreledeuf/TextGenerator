I see a wishing star up in the sky,
I start to make a wish upon that wishing star,
Which was so beauitful in my eyes,
but by the time I'd finished the wish,
The wishing star was starting to move away in the sky,
So I dipped my eyes & turned away,
For someone else to have a wish,
On that wishing star.
