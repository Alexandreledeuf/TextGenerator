Will you dance with me?
Will you set me free?
Will you love me true?
and I'll be there for you.
Will you care for us?
Without any fuss
coz Im in love with you
and you love me too
Will you stand by me?
Will you stay not flee
Will you pray at night
That I'll see the light
Will we be forever?
Now we are together
Your my guiding star
You know who you are
