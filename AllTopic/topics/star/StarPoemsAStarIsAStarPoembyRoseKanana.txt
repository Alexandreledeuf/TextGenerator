A star in any other dialect remains a star
Stars give hope for a pleasant night
As they retract into their cocoon
They pave way for a pleasant daylight
They leave promises that they will be back
And we gaze at them as they vanish
I have a star that guides me
In matters of life and love
The star depicts humility
The star depicts soberness
The star is promising
The star is bright
With a little excitement
Do stars get wet when it rains?
May be in a shower in socks
When star-heart throbs faster
In ecstasy and the joy
of conquering the world of the sky
We love stars
For stars have a biblical symbol
Of a journey led by God
And my star is led by God
To a destination where it shall meet a heavenly moon
My star, my life, my love, my anchor and my morning blessing.
