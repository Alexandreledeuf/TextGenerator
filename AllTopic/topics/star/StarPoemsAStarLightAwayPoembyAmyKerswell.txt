Your a thousand stars away.
The brightest shining star in the sky.
You are the glisten of the rain.
And the glistening of the stars.
Your a thousand starlights away.
But still you live in my heart.
I love you still the same.
If love could of saved you.
You would still be here today.
Love lives forever
So reall you did not die
So I never will forget you.
Well untill my time.
I will keep you in my heart.
When my time comes.
I will see you again
