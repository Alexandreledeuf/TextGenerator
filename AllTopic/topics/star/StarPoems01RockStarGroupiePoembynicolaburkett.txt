Back in black I hit you hard
With my classic rock chick style
I shake my hips to zeppelin hits
And watch you as you smile
If you want blood you got it
I’ll bleed and give you mine
I’ll let you taste below my waist
And drink my vintage wine
I shook you all night long
With the classic guitar groove
I lean back in the white snake sack
As my hips start to move
Purple rainbow straddles above me
As it drips on my naked skin
High like a free bird in the the sky
I knock back tequila & gin
