If winter, you wake up at four
From behind the closed window-door,
Whilst struggling to fight wintry chill,
I'm tucked in my cosy bed still.
At six no sun still, nor dawn's clout
But day's diurnal reign's not in doubt,
Dawn slowly shows up crimson red,
Reluctant I stir in my bed.
But you still rule early dawn's sky
Heedless of that cockerel cry
Announcing the reign of the sun,
And at that rooster's rant you yawn.
Seven, you nearly kiss zenith,
Whilst sun shows its bright tip beneath,
And prepares to rule all the day,
You curtail your magical sway.
And when at tall zenith you set—
Not that life's horizon you met,
We of East whilst give you a pat,
In West perhaps they doff their hat.
O brightest morning star, Venus,
As twilight star you're loved no less.
