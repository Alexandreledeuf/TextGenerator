I walk over to the place we used to visit,
Where laughter filled the rims of each cup,
Flowing over with desire and subdued embraces.
Blue flowers floating on crimson waves
Making its way into the enchanting waters.
I reach for a petal,
The beauty of it stands visible,
Accepting rays of golden light from the sun,
Extending her arms out to sprinkle kisses upon
The silver sand below my feet.
Wind from the east brushes me with thoughts of you,
And the place where you once sat lit up from a falling star,
I hold on to the passion within,
And close my eyes to see the light on your face,
Only knowing that deep inside me,
You reside.
