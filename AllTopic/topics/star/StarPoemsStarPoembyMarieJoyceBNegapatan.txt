You’re like a star
In a vast oblivion
Sparkling more than ever
Than all the earth’s diamonds
This velvety crown
Of royal curtsy
Kissing your path
From where your feet
Touches the ground
As I catch miracles
From the noble one
In this candle
Of purity flame
Muttering hope
And courage
That one day, I’ll meet
A divine glory
In your soul
From where it touches
My own.
