Wings of dreams
And shine of pearls
Away from worldly schemes,
That’s where we’re perched-
Up on a shining star,
Where senses are stirred, by-
Saccharine fragrances, twang of guitar,
Taste of ecstasy, touch of skin and
Gazing at you, my sweetest sin.
Up on a shining star, the
Moonbeams shine on us
Glowing in approval of our sacred love.
The sky erupts in a show of dazzle,
Because,
Every love story is special and
Every love story is worth of
Growing wings of dream and shine of pearls.
Every love story is worth of
Escaping worldly schemes and to be perched
Upon a shining star!
