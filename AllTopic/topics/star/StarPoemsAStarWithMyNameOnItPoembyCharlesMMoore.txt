This morning's passed so peacefully this morning
the time has come, I must be on my way
I only hope that when the fightings over
I'll be able to return to you one day
A long time since you kissed me with such passion
it makes me feel I'd really like to stay
we'll let the kids sleep on but when they waken
don't say I'm off to war just gone away
If the longing nights will make you sad and lonely
look up into the sky and you'll be saved
in  the heavens there's a star with my name on it
if we gaze at it then contact will be made
So brush away the tears that fill your eyes now
don't cry sweetheart I must be on my way
in the heavens there's a star with my name on it
if we gaze at it then contact will be made.
