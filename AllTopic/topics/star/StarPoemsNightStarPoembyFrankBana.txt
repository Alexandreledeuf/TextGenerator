I saw a shooting star, a falling star tonight
All green and gold, a peacock tail
(Perhaps it was a satellite)
Anyway it made a sign
Impressing the silent night upon me.
And I knew only that I loved you
That I was in love, that I love you -
All my knowledge deriving from that
I could be young and brilliant again
Upon the flight
Of falling full in love
And rising still, once more
To live beside the solemn sign.
