What kind of woman do you want
Star boy?
My intellect was never strong enough
to keep you.
You could never understand
the soil, the grass wasn´t  for you,
busy howling to the stars and the moon.
That map isn´t  mine, Star boy.
Is independence really a virtue?
I can hear you howling,
as I´m  laying in the grass.
I want to forget you,
but your fingerprints never left my body.
