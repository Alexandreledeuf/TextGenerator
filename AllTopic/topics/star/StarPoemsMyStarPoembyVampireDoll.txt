The darkness I embrace
For there is nothing else to do.
A star, my star has crashed down
Into a peaceful lake of memories,
Into the cold land.
Her name no men will ever know-
Her beauty is now dust.
How did she deserve such pain?
Why did she past away?
Though answers won't come on angel wings
Nor they will ever speak her name;
My star is fallen in the deepest corner
Of my soul.
And there she remaines to stay,
For etirnety.
Till the Last day.
