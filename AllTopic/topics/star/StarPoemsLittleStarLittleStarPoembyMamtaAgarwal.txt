Little star, little star
Why you live so far?
You really look so naughty
When from afar you wink at me.
You shine so bright above the hills.
I watch you when all is still.
Keep waiting for you in city,
Live in high rise, it’s a pity.
At times when I fly at night.
You look evermore bright.
I look and look and look.
and sketch in my book.
I truly, truly miss you.
Somehow I know you too.
Please come and say hi,
Oh now am sleepy, bye.
I’ll go to hills on weekend
Stay up late, talk, my friend.
Little star, little star,
Oh, why you live so far…
For you, of you Anika, my grand daughter.
