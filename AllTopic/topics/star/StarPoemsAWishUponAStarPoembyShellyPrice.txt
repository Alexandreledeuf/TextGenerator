Once upon a shining star,
I made a wish and it came true.
I wished for someone for me to love,
and then I was loving you.
You quickly became my everything,
my hopes my desires and my dreams.
Though we had our share of problems,
they were never as bad as they seemed.
But apparently they were bad enough,
you decided to part and go your own way.
Life for me has been an empty void,
since I couldn't convince you to stay.
In all my life I have seen so much,
I never imagined there could be more.
But trying to face each day without you,
is the toughest thing I've had to endure.
The saddest part about you being gone,
is that I no longer have my trusted friend.
I guess I always thought you would stay,
and we'd be together until the end.
So today I'm searching for another star,
one that I can wish upon once more.
I'll wish for you to come back to me,
to be the lover and friend I so adore.
