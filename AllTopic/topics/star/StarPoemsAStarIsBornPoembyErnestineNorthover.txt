The leading man walked onto the stage,
the house lights dimmed, a hush descended,
the play was about to begin.
A drama, powerful and dramatic.
Breaths were held, not one body moved.
Suddenly, he spoke.
'Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm afraid to have to inform you,
that our leading lady has been struck down by laryngitis,
therefore, the show is cancelled'.
Mumblings, rumblings, getting louder and louder.
'Not good enough' shouted someone.
'Sit down and shut up', shouted another.
Uproar! Pandemonium!
'Where's the understudy then? ' came from a third.
'She's also indisposed, I'm sorry to say', but your money
will be refunded in the foyer'.
'I know the part', a voice called from way down in the orchestra pit.
'If you'll give me a minute,
I'll go and change, and this show can start'.
Everyone sat down in amazement! '.
This small tiny girl, was bravely taking on the big leading role.
A hush descended in the auditorium,
and the curtains parted.
As the finale ended, there was a standing ovation.
The audience were thrilled.
The girl took a bow.
The orchestra played 'God Save The Queen'
and everyone clapped and cheered.
For here on this stage, this night, a star was born!
