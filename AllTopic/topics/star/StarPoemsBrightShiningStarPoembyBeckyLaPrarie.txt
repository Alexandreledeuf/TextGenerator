Star, star, you shine so bright
Lighting even my darkest night…
You make me smile
If only for a little while…
You remind me of the presence
Of my Lord most high,
As you shine so proudly in the sky…
I love a star lit night so true
It causes my emotions
To drift away
It makes me feel less blue…
When I am down and feel so out of place
Gazing upon your beauty causes a smile
To return to my face…
May I make a make believe wish upon you tonight
And can you tell me if my future will be bright
Stars, stars forever shine
For you are all favorites of mine
