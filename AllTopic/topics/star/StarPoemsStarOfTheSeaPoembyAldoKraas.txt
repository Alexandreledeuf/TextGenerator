Star of the sea
Your home is the sea
On the bottom of the sea
You live
The sea is clear
Just like a window of a house
You can see through it
At the sea
When you look through it
You can see the bottom of the sea
Very clear
And it is
Also like a window
Star of the sea
There in your
Home are other fish
That belong in your home with you
So you all have to share it
Star of the sea
I hope nobody steal you from your home
Because that would be ashame
In the sea is where you belong
Sometimes there are scuba divers
Diving down in your home
I hope they leave you
All alone
Let me tell you something
If the sea didn't existed
None of you would be around
Good bless you
Star of the sea
