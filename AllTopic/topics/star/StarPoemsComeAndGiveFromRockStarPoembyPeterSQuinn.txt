There you are in front of this
All the times are coming on
You are a night of sweet bliss
Twilights setting before it's gone
Flower in its earthy twist
The stream going by my feet
Everything in love I've missed
Loving you is love indeed
Come
Come and give
Everything to live for
Confusions are inside my heart
Going steps to other directions
Save me - come on do your part
I'd want so much your affections
Upon every clearance above
There you are standing for me
Giving me much of your love
Setting every directions free
Come
Come and give
Everything to live for
Come
Come and live
Everything and nothing more
Inside my heart I love you
Inside my heart I love you
Inside my heart I love you
You are confusions
Clearance above
You are - inclusions
Everything about love
There you are in front of this
All the times are coming on
You are a night of sweet bliss
Twilights setting before it's gone
Flower in its earthy twist
The stream going by my feet
Everything in love I've missed
Loving you is love indeed
