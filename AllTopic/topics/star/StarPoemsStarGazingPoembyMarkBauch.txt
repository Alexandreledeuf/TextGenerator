I was staring at the midnight sky
Star gazing
I realized life and space is really
Amazing
overall breathless with universal
Devastation
Tonight it’s a simply sky
But it will keep changing
Letting my mind grow beyond further horizons
Looking at constellations from Virgo to Orion
Shooting stars and burning galaxies
This universe isn’t filled with fallacies
It’s filled with nitrogen and hydrogen gas
Expanding it is, but how long will it last
We love to stare at it endlessly
But do we really appreciate its beauty
