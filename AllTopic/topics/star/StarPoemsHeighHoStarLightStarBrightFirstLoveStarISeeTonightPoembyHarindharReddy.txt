I watch the sunlight dance across your face of elegance,
And I've never been this swept away in romance......
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms......
The whole world just fades away in nothingness;
The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart, oh tess!
Heigh-ho! Star light, star bright! First love star, I see tonight!
Ding, ding, dong! Ding, ding dong! Love bells jingle in my heart!
I can feel magic floating in air, being with you gets me that way
I can feel you breathe, itâ€™s washing over me, oh baby love empress
I'm melting into you, I can feel your charm, oh baby love countess
Nothing left to prove much, just to be caught up in your touch,
I can feel you breathe, just breathe, the slow and steady rush as such!
Keep me warm, Kiss me hard, hug me lot, feel my heart anyway.
Heigh-ho! Star light, star bright! First love star, I see tonight!
Ding, ding, dong! Ding, ding dong! Love bells jingle in my heart!
I love you love for the love you gave and for time we had....
I love you love for the tempestuous thoughts and happiness I got;
I love you love for your support and for loving me a lot.
I love you love for teaching me love and making me beloved.
I love your for living with me 24/7 and seventy times seven!
I love you love for liberating my soul and lifting me to heaven.
Heigh-ho! Star light, star bright! First love star, I see tonight!
Ding, ding, dong! Ding, ding dong! Love bells jingle in my heart!
