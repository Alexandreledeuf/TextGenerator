Morning star from where you are
Can you see my tiny heart
From so many
Can you see the only me
Can you see me way down here
Making a wish, oh can you hear
Oh morning star
I am wishing with all my heart
All I want in all my life
Is someone to walk beside in life
So lonely, Iâ€™m so lonely
Can you make it right
Grandpa had always told me
The first star that I see
Make a wish upon the morning star
The morning star will answer me
Morning star, morning star
Can me down here you find
Would you take away the loneliness
Could you ever be so kind.
