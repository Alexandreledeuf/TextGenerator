Breaking the waves to finally know,
What is the truth in this old game;
Places to hold come to and grow,
Bring some thoughts give it a flame.
Close in a place just like this,
Anything goes down to its start;
Blinking your eyes making a wish,
All roads lead to your own heart.
Somebody told me rumours and lies,
You had it going for too long;
What looked so natural is a surprise,
Inside and out rightly or wrong.
Bring it all back - bring it all back,
I never thought it came so close;
What I did miss was just a crack,
Anything comes and anything goes.
Breaking the waves finding the spear,
I feel tonight more confidential;
It took some years to be so austere,
For love and life are so vulnerable.
Peace with yourself all is forgotten,
What was or ought never to return;
Feelings like roots sometimes are rotten,
Passions like mornings ever to burn.
Bring it all back - bring it all back,
I never thought it came so close;
What I did miss was just a crack,
Anything comes and anything goes.
