I found it at starry night.
It was tiny like a dot -
Against a black background – white.
“It’s impossible” – I thought.
I could see it in the sky.
It seemed unattainable,
And too distant, and too shy…
But it was undeniable.
I wanted to give you it
To make you feel my love.
Yet, I still delay, still quit.
Are you ready enough?
