I wished upon a star one day
As it went shooting through the sky,
I wished upon a star one day
As it passed me by.
I wished upon a star one day
That my prays come true,
I wished upon a star one day
And then i thought of you.
I wished upon a star one day
And realised i was crying,
I wished upon a star one day
Then dreamed that i was dying.
I wished upon a star one day
But my wish never became real,
I wished upon a star one day
And realised what i feel....
Nothing!
