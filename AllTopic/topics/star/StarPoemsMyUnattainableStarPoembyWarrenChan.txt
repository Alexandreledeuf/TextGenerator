Star light, star bright,
The most beautiful star in my sight,
I wish I may, I wish I might,
To be with you for just one night.
To shoot through the sky in an endless flight,
To bask in your grace-
Yes, just one night.
But unfortunately you are but a star in the sky
And no matter how hard I try and try,
Youâ€™re still a star-
In that yonder sky.
