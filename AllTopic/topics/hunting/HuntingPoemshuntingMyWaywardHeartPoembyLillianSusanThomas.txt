I am hunting my wayward heart.
I can feel that steady drum beat,
Following the ruby river
With fingertips like bloodhounds,
Tracking it to the source.
But continually the heart flees,
Running from this pain
That only ardor can inflict.
We all know it is only amour
We must armor ourselves for.
Love is a machete
Slashing on both sides -
As you fall into love,
And as you fall out -
All the time while under its spell
We are like sleepwalkers
Balancing on the single edge
That does not cut.
