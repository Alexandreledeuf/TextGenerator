A Golden Eagle stands tall upon its perch,
with keen eyes, for its next victim to search.
Suddenly it spreads wings, is off with a lurch,
sweeping low o'er groves of aspen and birch.
A jackrabbit stirs near a clump of brush.
Silently toward it the eagle does rush.
The rabbit's life-ending cry breaks the hush.
Too late!  The eagle, its backbones does crush.
With rabbit in tow it flies to its nest
where its chick gobbles warm handouts with zest.
With its mate the parent shares all the rest,
preparing themselves for the next hunting quest.
