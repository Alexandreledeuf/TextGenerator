I Hunted Words Of Skill
To Make Your Insides Feel
Joy and Peace and Love
From Fantasy To Real
I Sought To Express
Genuine Care and Gentleness
Tho’ It Takes Stones To Build
Bridge Of Togetherness
Beneath A Darkened Sky
Sometimes It Seemed Pages Would Cry
But By Moonlight, They Would Rise
and Laugh With Skies
As Each Star Would Twinkle Yonder
And Wink Down In Knowing Wonder
Giving Words To Ponder
Of A PoemHunter …
I Looked For Words To Speak
Each One Sweetly Bold, Unique
To Shoot The Soul’s Mystique
A Bow’s Arrow Feat
… and I Looked For Poems
With Power In Their Storms
Words That Warm Or Warn
Or Rock In Hugging Arms
I Hunted Words Of Skill
Thoughts To Make Us Feel
That Love Is Real
And So Is  GOD’s  Will …
… and Thank You PoemHunter
For The Thrill …
