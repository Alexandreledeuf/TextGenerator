Soaring gull, against the sky
I, on wing, to circle high
On a path to seek, begin
All the crumbs you lay quite thin
On my search to strongly feast
On your trailing beauty beach
Diving fast to steal a taste
Of Your quicken discarded waste
For one morsel in the sand
Not the waving of your hand
In your growing shorter shadow
On a passing breeze to straddle
Eyeing pieces of your promise
Set coordinating compass
Steering straight my downward spiral
Fighting off whomever rivals
My catching and consuming
As the crimson sunset looming
Makes your tidbits left so tempting
A retrieval task, lamenting
My feathers flash their bunting
Headfirst falling while crumb hunting
