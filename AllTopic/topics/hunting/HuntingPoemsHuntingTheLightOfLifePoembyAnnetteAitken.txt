Hunting The Light
Travelling down the sewers
of this ungrateful soul of mine
as the sickness becomes a squatter
taken over my body and mind.
The torment that's unleashed
upon the unsuspecting visitors
who just happen by chance
to cross paths.
Thrown into the abyss
without a care or second glance
discarded, rendered useless
left to die, a lonely death.
As vibrant colours dissipates
as their sparkles are dying out
life has lost its meaning
only inner struggles remain.
But,
I'm sure I heard it mentioned once
of a light that still remains
a tunnel with an exit light
I'll search for, not in vain
to find this elusive tunnel.
Where life begins again.
Hunting for the light of life.
