Sun comes and goes
So desperate, my mind is spinning
'I am single' the wind is singing
I can't clamp a toe on the ground
Moving like goats searching around
For a mate, someone to heal me
Always on mini-skirts in the street
My dressing hides nothing secret
I contemplate love for a kob
Where I hunt them like a cub
Everybody likes me, they lust me
I touch clouds, I thought they love me
He left me, he left and so they kept on
I can't recognise my mistakes
And they can't tell me
They don't love me
I want to be loved
This time I won't look for love
Let him get me at my parent's home
I wait for the right person!
