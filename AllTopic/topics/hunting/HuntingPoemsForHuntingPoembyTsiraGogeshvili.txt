For Hunting...
Heart is given only with heart...
Nobody can fly with one wing.
I feel with  smell, snow will begin.
The dog oblivion - will start to bark...
You do not miss in winter's nights.
You'll prepare the  horse for  hunt's...
Only - is cautious, is  on each  step...
Traps are awake for you  in forest....
