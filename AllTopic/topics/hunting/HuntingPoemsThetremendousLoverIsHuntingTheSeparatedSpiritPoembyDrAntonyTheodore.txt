There is the remorseless, tireless seeking
and following of the soul by the Divine Life.
The inexorable onward sweep of this
â€˜Tremendous lover' is hunting the separated spirit
that flees him down the nights and down the days.
Our natural will is to have God.
The good will of God is to have us.
We may never cease from longing
till we have him in fullness of  joy.
The mystic vision is of a spiritual universe,
held tight within the bonds of love.
