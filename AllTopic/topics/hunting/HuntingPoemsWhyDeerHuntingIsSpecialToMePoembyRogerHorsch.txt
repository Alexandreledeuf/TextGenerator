It seems like we thrive from the adrenaline flow
While hunting the morning of the very first snow.
For all the mornings that we practically froze
When we can't feel our fingers, or the tips of our toes.
Yet, we still hunt day after day
In anticipation of the moment we can finally say
'I GOT A DEER' with a cheerful shout.
As we jump up and down and run all about.
We think it's skill, but it's mostly luck
That feeling we get when we get our first buck.
When we talk about the hunt, or the antler size
No one knows the real truth, 'cause everyone lies.
It's remembering our first hunt, as a girl or a boy
When we felt the excitement with a heart full of joy.
It's the fun that we have with our family and friends.
It's the sharing and experience that we hope never ends.
So, go deer hunting...just do it some day
Then you might understand what I'm trying to say.
Hunting deer is special to me
So, try it sometime and you'll find out and see.
