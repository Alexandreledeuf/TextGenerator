good will hunting
hunting down answers
begins with knowing
asking right questions
i ask questions
questions are good
first the questions
then the answers
next applied an art of reason
where is truth where illusion
where deceit where delusion
where fabricated stealth collusion
jigsaw pieces found misplaced or lost
trail cold warm hot or made of frost
written data primary secondary forgery
forensic clues credibility elementary
preconceptions prime misdirection
story written story read is between lines
audience appeal sharpens attention
truth plot blind thickens deceit quickens
the truth the whole truth nothing but truth
testimony corresponds to facts accuracy
true sincerity true statements error made
life stories real misty truth untruth reality
