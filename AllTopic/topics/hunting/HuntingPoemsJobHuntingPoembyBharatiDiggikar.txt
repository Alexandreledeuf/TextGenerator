Job hunting
The interviews are on |She is unadorned
Whirling fans creak.
Her red cotton saree |A black bag to carry
Yellow walls stare.
She does look chic |No make-up, lipstick
On her young face.
But kajal in her eye | Clouds in her sky
Clock pounds beats.
Back home aging father|Young siblings gather
In traffic-jammed space
The job seals her fate|Silent sighs escape
Her turn coming next
In vacuum of her heart | There is a tiny spark
She must put it out.
