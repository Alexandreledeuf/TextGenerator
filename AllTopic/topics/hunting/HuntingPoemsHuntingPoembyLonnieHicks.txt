'Where 'she said
'does love live? '
Is it in your eyes?
I have looked there;
I look there every day.
Is it in your heart?
I know it beats
but some days
it is so faint;
In your mind?
That is opaque.
Tell me where does your love for me live?
I said
'I am taught
that deeds and providing
are where my love shows;
in being sure everyone here is safe
and that there is enough
for what everyone wants or needs.
I am not good at flowery words;
at affection even.
I wish I were better.
for you.
What about you?
Where does your love for me live? '
She said
'It is everywhere with me
in my heart, it pounds you know still
for you.
In the house.
I place my love in flower vases
in the vacuum cleaner;
in dinner
in the wine served.
In my thoughts and emotions.
I remember everything
we've ever done.
He said:
I wish I had that ability you have.
I think I am made for the hunt.
But now
there is no hunt.
