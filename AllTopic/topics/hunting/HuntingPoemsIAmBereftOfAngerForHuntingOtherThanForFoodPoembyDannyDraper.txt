I am bereft of anger
that has passed through rage
For the empty humans that
Cannot share or partake in this one Earth
They have removed themselves
from our greater ken
and the union of all life
They can no longer return to us,
not due to being out laws
But due to being outliers
from the sum of our potential
and better nature to know right from wrong
and respect inherently
the dignity of all life.
