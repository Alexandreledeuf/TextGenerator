Hunting season is coming up
And deer is your main prey
Wear bright colors, so you wont get stuck
Taking your life away
When sitting in a tree stand
Or walking along with others
Make sure what you see is not a man
Waiting for deer in a gutter
Safety is the most important thing
When hunting with a bow or a gun
A terrible tragedy they can bring
When using them just for fun
So take my advise and play it safe
Hunting is not a game
Take your time, it's not a race
The results will still be the same
