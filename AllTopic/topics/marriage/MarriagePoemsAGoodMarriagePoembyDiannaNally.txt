A good marriage is made of equal respect
And the ability to communicate
You have to be able to talk to each other
You have to be able to relate
You have to show each other every day
How much in love you are
It takes two people to make it work
Together, not from afar
Some say you don't have to work on a marriage
Marriages work out on their own
Those are the people who live in denial
And usually end up alone
And don't forget we all have our faults
stay strong and feed off each others strength
Worry about being happy in your marriage
And less about it's length
All I can tell you is what works for us
And it's been working for over 30 years
We've shared love, respect and a wonderful friendship
And we have even shared a few tears
I wouldn't trade marriage for all the money in the world
I would never trade the man that I love
We are an example of what real soul mates are
And our marriage was blessed from God above
I LOVE YOU CHUCK
