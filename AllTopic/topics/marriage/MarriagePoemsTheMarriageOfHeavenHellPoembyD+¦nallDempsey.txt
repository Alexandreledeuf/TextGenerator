'Oh well...why not
...I suppose! '
she said stripping
shyly off her
clothes
'Oh you...dirty little devil! '
he laughed
grabbing her by the calf
as she toppled & fell
on her back & squealed:
'Oh...Heavens! '
a frilly froth of
discarded panties
crawling across
the shag carpet
he fallen to his knees
trousers trapping his ankles
'Jesus! ' he gasped
'Oh Christ...! ' she almost
prayed.
They took each other to the cleaners
(& other misdemeanours)
went all the way
to Hell & back
(going like the clappers)
he beside himself
she all in a flap.
It was...Heaven
