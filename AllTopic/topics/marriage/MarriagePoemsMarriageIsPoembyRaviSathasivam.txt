Marriage is a fulfillment of dreams
It is an oath of life between two loving partners
It is the most beautiful thing that can happen in your life
It is a feeling to be cherished, nurtured and care for
It is promise today for tomorrow together
It is bond to hold each other when love bloom
It is caring each other life time
It is an understanding between two hearts
It is willingness to step forward without being afraid
It is sharing, forgiving and compassion
It is mysterious but ask you to share the secrets
Trust each other and the journey of marriage will lead
in to a great love forever.
