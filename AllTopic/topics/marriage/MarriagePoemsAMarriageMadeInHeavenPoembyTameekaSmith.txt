When God brings together,
Two people in a marriage,
He encourages,
Many things along the way.
To never be afraid,
Of the steps,
That are directed by Him.
Fellowship daily,
Be in a hurry for nothing,
And always open to learning,
One another,
Have much prayer,
Lots of patience,
For this is necessary,
To have a marriage of greatness.
Know the time for fruitfulness,
As well as gentleness,
And always be prepared,
For a lesson in forgiveness.
Keep in mind one another's feelings.
Be willing to give all that,
You can possibly give,
Doing all this,
Will help with faithfulness.
Especially when you realize,
The best part of a great union,
Is having your life long,
Friend for all eternity.
These are some of the keys,
For a marriage made in Heaven.
