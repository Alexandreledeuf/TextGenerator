This is a new odyssey
The new beginning you’ll see
Don’t let it drowned into the sea
Hold on tight and firmly
Marriage life is beautiful
Be mindful and thoughtful
Sleeping with each other is rightful
Caring for each other is soulful
If something awful stir your pleasantry
Take it seriously and wisely
Work it out with honesty and integrity
Then you’ll find your ties a victory
When you’re blessed with children
Give them love and education
The combination to excel with distinction
To prepare them for prestigious institution
While endure to your new world
Don’t neglect your beloved parents
Should you not, it’d be cruel
For they are your past and present
Remember the wisdom of relationship
The bloodline is the lifeline
Like an entrepreneurship
Don’t cut it off until you’re resigned
