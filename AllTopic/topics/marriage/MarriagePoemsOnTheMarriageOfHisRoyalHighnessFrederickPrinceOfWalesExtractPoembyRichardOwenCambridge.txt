Nor did there on the other side, I ween,
Forms though more soft, less heav'nly appear;
Conjugal Love and Concord still were seen,
Becoming Meekness and Submission near;
Next Truth, a window in her naked breast,
Modesty and Prudence ever judging right,
Piety, adding lustre to the rest,
And heav'n-born Charity appear'd in sight;
Blest is the Maid whose paths these virtues guide,
Happy! thrice happy He possess'd of such a Bride!
