A bough bent young
To fetch an ideal dream
Swinging in its bow…..
A wooden plank
Roped and rigged
Sparrow’s chirp
Fill the air
Vacant the swing no more………
Child in marriage
In pockets of society
Swings the swing…..
With offspring’s
Sweet and many
Myna’s chirp solitary
Duty done well?
Vacant the swing no more………
Bleak, dark clouds
Waters of vapour random gather
That sustain the heat could not!
Flew up droplets, up in the air so blue
To cloudy dreamy clouds
To tease till tears trickle
Rains! Down pour!
Swing;
Vacated in haste in down pour!
Children in this bonding
Sweet innocence
Pressured till
Stolen dreams were pacified
Bend at will
As soft clay still
Half the days in toils glare
Shaped to ends
Duty doubtfully lingers….
Swing;
Vacated in timeless life’s outpour
We are sinners
Saved by grace
Patient the lord
Watching us with no haste!
