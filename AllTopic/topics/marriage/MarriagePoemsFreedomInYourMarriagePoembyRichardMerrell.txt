Is there freedom in your marriage?
Or is there bondage bringing woe
Is there freedom in your marriage?
This is what I'd like to know.
For marriage is two people
Each sharing the others love
Not telling each other how to live
Nor giving each other the shove.
For each is an individual
With free-will to be such;
Giving and receiving in their talents -
However much.
Having freedom to enjoy at times
What each may like to do;
Pleasing each other by attitude
Being happy for each too.
Standing by each other
When outsiders shoot the tongue
No matter what the cost might be
For freedom you're among.
So, is there freedom in your marriage?
I pray there is today,
For only in love's freedom -
Marriage will be for aye!
