“Do you...
(Donall Donall)
take this woman’s body
to have & to hold
to totally transform
by the bliss
of loving her? ”
“I do...I do! ”
“Do you...
(Janice A. Windle)
take this man
to tease & to tempt
to tantalise beyond
all human endurance
so that he almost
expires from the ecstasy
of your loving arms? ”
“I do...I do too! ”
“You may now
make love.”
