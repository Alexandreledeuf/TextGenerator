What those marriage worth, I am already yours
We have marriage by heart not by rituals.
Our marriage is pious then those done by priests
And those other who are eyeing are big fool
Those who tell that I have no right on you
Donâ€™t know that we are lovers by heart
Our children have already started to play
Not those physical children but our love has passed third anniversary.
Is physical marriage bigger then natural?
Even god believes in original heart marriage
Who dare to discard my say can anyone tells me?
If not then why dismay in her physical marriage
I am already husband of yours and you my wife
That crimson in your head, necklace in your neck has not value.
