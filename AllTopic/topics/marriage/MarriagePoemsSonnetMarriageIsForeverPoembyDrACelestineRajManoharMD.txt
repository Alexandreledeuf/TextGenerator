When once your single state of life is changed
By sacred Marriage vows and carnal ties,
You never from spouse ever be estranged;
The nuptial bond before God never dies.
To each other, you owe your fidelity,
And mutual understanding reigns supreme;
The union is for life’s eternity!
’Tis real and never becomes a dream.
And Marriage is a Sacrament for man!
No power on earth dare separate the two;
The hearts and bodies harmoniously can
Withstand all things attempting to undo.
With how many hearts can one heart unite?
The Sun has just the same Moon every night!
