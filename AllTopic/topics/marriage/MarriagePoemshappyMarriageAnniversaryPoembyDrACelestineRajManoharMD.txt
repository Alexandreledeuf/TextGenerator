Full seventeen years have rolled off now
Since marriage; only God knows ‘how? ’
We may have had our years of strife;
But on the whole, ‘twas nice a life!
Our children are our wealth;
The Scripture gives us health
Of body, mind, heart, soul,
Till we fulfill our role.
The morrow seems so good;
So is our spiritual mood;
God cares and us provides;
Our future, He decides.
Let worry, never us worry;
Our failures past, we must bury;
For sins, let’s say to God. ‘Sorry! ’
En Road to Heaven, let’s hurry!
