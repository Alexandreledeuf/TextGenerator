Year 1
Launching our boat
On the lake of life.
Two eager shipmates
Going wherever the gentle breeze
Takes us
Too caught in each other’s arms and eyes
To see where we are
Or care
Where we are heading.
Year 10
Rowing furiously,
Back to back.
Focused
On opposite shores
Trying desperately to free ourselves
From the other’s grip.
Year 25
Now we sit
Side by side,
Synchronised strokes
In our battered boat.
Basking in the warmth
Of unchallenging
Companionship
As we enjoy the view
Of the journey we’ve shared.
