Because, I have found that one person in a million,
that one person, who I love to the depth of my being,
and who loves me more,
Because, I have found that soul mate,
who understands me, better than I understand myself.
Who can anticipate, nearly always, my intricate moods,
And either, join the party, or pass the tissues.
Why Marriage?
Because I want the whole world to know,
that we have found each other.
That the search that drives me out of bed each morning,
through floods of heartaches, sorrows and pain,
can have an end.
There will still be heartaches, sorrows and pain,
But now I have someone to share them with.
Why Marriage?
Because I know that from now on,
we will not always be the vision of loveliness we are today.
I might be less than perfect, you might be, the housemate from hell.
So I want that thread of hope and promise, that binds us together,
to keep my love tethered until storms departs.
I know that love is not something you can build a wall around,
something that you can fence in, and guard.
Love is a butterfly, which constantly flies towards the light,
and when a gust should blow our love of course,
I want our marriage to be the solid candle that burns brightest.
Marriage is my declaration of commitment,
and my hope to grow old with the one I love.
The one, I can no longer imagine life without.
The one, with whom I want to share a smile,
and in that smile say a hundred years of shared memories.
Someone whose arms will never tire,
if they are around me.
I want, all that went before, to be considered waiting.
Waiting for the fates to drive us together.
I want the time we spent together, outside marriage,
to be the time we built and tested our relationship,
and now fully proven we move forward.
Why Marriage?
Because I want the world to see that we have become one,
a union bound by our love and the love of our friends, all encompassing.
Andâ€¦ most of all, because we want to.
