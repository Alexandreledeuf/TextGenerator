Marriage is the joining of two bodies and two minds
Past mistakes are unwanted and better left behind
From this day forth you must take care of each other
You’ll learn to draw strength each day from one another
The first year is hardest but you must learn to adapt
Find your middle ground and the rest will work out
It’s a beautiful journey if you are dedicated
Time is your friend and will keep you educated
Learn from mistakes and heed this advice
Never bring them up and never try them twice
Appreciate each other and be verbally kind
Each day when the sun sets leave your anger behind
As your journey progresses and the children arrive
Remember to keep your marriage alive
Your children will grow up and leave the nest
Make sure your marriage doesn’t die from loneliness
By following these words you’ll find marriage is bliss
And you’ll find there is no better place than this
Home is meant to be your soft place to fall
And the love you project will envelope it all
