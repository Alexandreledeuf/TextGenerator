Is marriage a forced prostitution?
Or part of noble institution?
Why there be irrelevant question?
Or even stress and specific mention,
When tied a nuptial knot,
No question of no or not,
After so many wrangles fought,
Beautiful creature in vision is caught,
Many argue it is decided in heaven,
Not facing odds but some situation also even,
When marriage is over, happy ending then,
Question arises how to begin new life and when,
Initial days pass with happiness and joy,
To keep bride happy all tactics employ,
Each passing of day may add happiness or gloom,
Flowers also may fade after initial boom,
When wife starts distancing self,
All utensils make noise in shelf,
Soon to realize reality and gravity of situation,
Days may be over marking end of infatuation,
With issue of one or two more kids,
Most of the time spent on feeds,
Slackness in relation emerge to surface,
Wife may feel as if going near to furnace,
All this lead to scuffle and unrest,
Real time comes when relation to test,
All try to avoid and keep it as best,
Everything now done is at their behest,
Legal pundits say marriage can be termed,
Forced prostitution may be but canâ€™t be named,
Court may term it as torture and atrocity,
Life can be in doldrums and not remain as continuity,
Whether willing or unwilling she has to submit,
Though not to liking but surrender and admit,
But it is long and painful debate,
Matter should end and nothing more to relate,
