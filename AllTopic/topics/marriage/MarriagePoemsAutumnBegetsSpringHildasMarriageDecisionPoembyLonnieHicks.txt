You have no seasons;
you are an undifferentiated
whole with no seams:
Guarded or Integrated?
I can't decide.
You whole life seems
well, so together.
And you love me.
I think you really do.
You are my Eternal Summer
well-off, a famous family
and persistent
in your interest in me.
There will be no seasonal
changes with you
and you and your mother
have already been shopping
for the children's wardrobes.
I have another suitor too.
He is Winter, chaste and unsure
of everything
except me.
He loves me too.
He is all future-
the dreamer.
He sweeps me up
in his beingness
for hours on end.
I adore him;
he brings things in me alive.
So what is it to be.
Endless Summer
or uncertain Winter?
I am stick here in
my Autumn
wondering
what I can do to get to
Spring.
