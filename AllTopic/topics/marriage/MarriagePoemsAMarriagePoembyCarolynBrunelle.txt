In some force of nature
He reaches for her
Time and time again.
And time after time
She soothes his fevered brow,
Calms and strokes the fury in him.
A marriage of sea and shore
Embracing only one another;
And yearning for nothing more
They thrash and crash about.
The going has always been rough but
They cling to their life in one another;
Knowing separately each would die there.
But together, their dance continues
Painting a mesmorizing beauty;
Timeless and enduring
Through sunshine as well as storm.
