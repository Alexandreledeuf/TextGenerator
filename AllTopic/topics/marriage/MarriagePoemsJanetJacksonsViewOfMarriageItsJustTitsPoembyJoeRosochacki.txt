Janet Jackson is allergic to marriage,
Imagine that?
Her brother is Michael,
he hangs around and lets little boys sleep in his bed,
Is there a kind of perverse genetic disorder that is involved their respective genomes?
I think their whole world is malfunctioning;
Whether it may a super bowl wardrobe or plastic surgical face.
Michaelâ€™s propping of his offspring on the outside balcony,
in Germany,
Janet affinity to her pop star status makes one wonder and convinced,
Yes, I am really blessed and lucky.
