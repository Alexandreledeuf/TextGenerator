Depression is like a wave pulling you further in
You don't feel up to facing anyone or anything
Depression is a huge emphasis on feeling sad and low
You feel like you're in a dark place with no where else to go
Depression is like you're falling deeper into a blackhole
Your mind feels violated and as though you have no control
Depression is having little energy and lack of motivation
you feel tired and don't want to engage in conversation
Depression is used in the wrong context by naive people
They don't understand the seriousness of how it affects people
Depression is isolation, withdrawl, low self-esteem, and much more
You will never understand it unless you've been through it before
