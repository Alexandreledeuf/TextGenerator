I am loosed, I am free
I have no responsibility
No longer to be found
The shackles and chains that had me bound
A new life waits ahead
It is the unknown what I most dread
Though I'm free as a dove
I'd surrender if bound by your love
Let not go is my plea
Please bring again my captivity
Without you I am lost
Hold onto me no matter the cost
