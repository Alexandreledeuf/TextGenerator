Depression sets in
When you wanna die
You're not willing to try
Depression sets in
When you cant take it
And all you wanna do is cry
You're seventeen
And all you can think
Is this life is long and hard.
There's gotta be something
There's gotta be a way
To stay happy
And never have to cry
Never have to be so upset
Where you just wanna die
But nothing is like that
Nothing can make you happy
And depression sets in
