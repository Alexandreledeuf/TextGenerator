Staring at the walls...at the pictures that hang there
each photo...of it all
each step of our relationship..that started, with lust, wanting and care
the last picture that is hung
showing the ultimate happiness, of us being in love
I GET THE DEEPEST DEPRESSION
just staring at these things...
the photos on the wall
and the finger that holds my engagement ring
looking around the room, looking at it all
now just filled with dread, n, doom
the dieing roses in the crystal vase
marks the symbol..of the day
when it all was lost, n, went away
the photo album that we made
starts with the pictures of our 1st date, where it started
the last picture is of us, in love
3 days, b4 love was departed
is of the day you proposed, look at it, we are so in love
a red box that had matched
the teddy bear with the red herat attached
in which you gave to me b4 the proposal, inside it held the ring
to unite our love, to bring
us 2gether, from now til 4ever
I GET THE DEEPEST DEPRESSION
JUST LOOKING AT THESE THINGS
the 2 wine glasses,4m which we drank, sealing the deal
a begining to our new fate
n to our proposal, we gave, love cheers, and thanks
the card thats hung,4m the dieing flowers in theyre crystal vase
that you gave.....to me..b4 you kneeled onto 1 knee
uttering the most 4 words a man can say...
all of it is now gonn..just taken away
just in such a short time....3 damn days
I GET THE DEEPEST DEPRESSION
JUST HOLDING THESE THINGS....
the pictures, the wine glass
the teddy bear with the red heart attached
the photo album, the 1st photo, in which we started
the courtship, that blossomed into a beautiful relationship
the last photo, hung on the wall...its left me so broken hearted
the cards i kept in a shoe box, from you, giving to me through
no reason @ all, my birthday, holidays, n anniversary
each card filled with words of love, each card, having its own diversity
I GET THE DEEPEST DEPRESSION
JUST HOLDING, N, TOUCHING, OR LOOKING AT ALL OUR THINGS
to the life we had, the home we made
that just vanished...poof, went away.....
DEEPEST DEPRESSION OVER EVERYTHING....
ESPECIALIALLY THE FINGER THAT WEARS MY ENGAGEMENT RING.....
