I scream but there's no sound,
I cry but there's no tears,
Is this life,
Or am i isolated with emotion.
No one is listening,
I dont think anyone cares,
Is this life,
Or hell with normal people.
I try to act normal,
But no one know's the thoughts inside my head,
My so called life,
Filled with thoughts of being better off dead.
