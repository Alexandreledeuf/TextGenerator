Depression hurts when you grow old
And life  has passed you by
No more dreams to think about
Or even wishes to come true
You lose a friend and then another and
There's no past to talk about
No laughter, only tears to shed
That others cannot see
Depression hurts no matter what you try
It breaks you down till nothing matters
Life doesn't matter either
You come or go, who cares
No one that really cares too much
No friend thats left to tell your troubles to
No love that puts its arms around you
And holds you close.
Why stay and sit in this old chair
With nothing to do day after day
Smoke cigarettes, why not
Its too late now to care
Goodbye to this life I would gladly say
Why God won't take me now
I do not know because he knows I want to go
Home with others that I love
There's more up there than down here
More love from friends in heaven
No friends do I count down here
Depression hurts, it hurts down deep inside
It breaks your heart and destroys your mind
Your thoughts are eratic and blown
Until the thoughts that used to come
Are gone forever,  depression hurts
