I just feel so down
I only frown
I have no smile left
Depression is a theft
I hate that I feel this way
I wish my feelings will go away
But I guess they're here to stay
I feel like I don't care
But I swear
That I can't bare
To be without feelings
And my heart isn't healing
Like it should
But I would
Do anything to take the pain away
I'd do it today
I wish I could talk about it
But my parent's would throw a fit
If they found out my reasons
It's just not the right season
To tell them how I feel
But I'll make you a deal
I'll tell you
If you believe it's true
Do you?
Good because you should
Now I could
Tell you all about it
But please don't throw a fit
It's because of my dad
He makes me so sad
And then he gets mad
At me for nothing
And I'd do anything
To make him proud of me
But he can't see
That I try too hard
I play the wrong card
Because he has no clue
That I'm sick with the depression flu
And my mom
Tries to play dumb
She says she'll love me no matter what
But she still treats me like a mut
I still have feelings
Even if my heart isn't healing
I can still feel the pain
That they're making me gain
I want you to accept me
But you can't see
That I am what I am
And you side with them
And you don't accept me
I just want to be me
And I want them to love me
I wanna make them proud of me!
