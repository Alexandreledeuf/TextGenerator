Depression has taken over me..
Gobbled up my soul..
Will I ever be happy again? ..
Will I ever be whole?
Why can't it just leave me alone?
Why can't it just go away?
I just want to be happy again...
Leave me depression, so I can feel again today...
I don't want you here anymore..
Dont want you hear to stay!
Go!
Just Go Away!
