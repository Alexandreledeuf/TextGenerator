If you say you're upset because you're tired....
At least you're not depressed.
If you say you're upset because you're depressed...
At least you're not in physical pain.
If you're upset because you're in physical pain...
At least you have your mind.
If you're upset because you're tired, depressed, in physical pain, and in danger of losing your mind...
At least you're alive.
And, if you're upset because you're dying...
At least when you're dead you won't have to worry about all of the above.
