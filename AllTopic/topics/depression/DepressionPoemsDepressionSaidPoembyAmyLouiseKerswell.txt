Do you no who I am?
I am no saint I am no lamb.
I make you live in terror.
This you can not sever.
I live in your head.
I must be fed.
I need the taste of your blood.
Filling me like a flood.
I love how it flows like a river.
Always making you quiver.
You thought you were so stroung.
But you couldnt of been any more wrong.
I am your soul.
I am keeping you whole.
I love to watch you drool.
You are nothing but a fool.
I will never go.
This you must know.
I am your history your now and I am the futer.
I am your second minute and hour.
I am an insane cannibal.
Just like a crazed animal.
I will eat you from the inside out.
This you will have no doubt.
Do you know who I am?
I am no saint I am no lamb.
Have you become wise?
That I am the devil in diguise.
