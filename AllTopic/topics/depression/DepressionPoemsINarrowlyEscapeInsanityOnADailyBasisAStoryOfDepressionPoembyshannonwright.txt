My heart askew and my brain out of place
I narrowly escape insanity on a daily basis
fuzzy clouds of sorrow and regret
that I lay my head on each night
unable to concentrate on anything but my pulse
I will myself to numbness, nothingness
in a walking coma, I hear voices but no words
I see faces but don’t recognize my reflection.
I want to scream but haven’t the energy,
so instead I bury myself under my blankets of despair
and pray that the world will go away.
