A black hole, closes in
Blocking the light, cold within.
A swallowing mass, empty and black
Tears me apart, supermassive attack.
Icy hands rip out my heart
I’m so messed up, i’m torn apart.
I cannot breathe, it’s suffocation
I’m on my own, in isolation.
The darker it gets, the less I see,
I’m trapped, there’s no way out for me.
Behind a smile, in me hide,
No-one knows, i’m dying inside.
Yet I wake each morning and carry on
I will not cry, i must be strong!
