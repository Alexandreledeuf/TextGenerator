Oh!  Depression!
I love you
And you love me
You are my life and my need
You are my love and passion too
You are my soul
The light through which I see this dreary world
Oh! Depression, Depression!
Together we shall die.
All at once, jostled by a thunderbolt
Lo! Behold! A ray of light
GOD said, Do not fret my child
What my child want, I give
Tears of joy and ecstasy streamed down my eyes,
My prayers were answered.
