When you try to make it better
With the truths you hold so close
And the lies made up apart of you
To the ones you hate the most
Something screams inside I'll never change
When your thoughts are painted black
Someone chose for me to be this way...
And there's only me to thank
And when your heart falls in the way you think
There's really no turning back
And the ones you think you thought you loved
Could never judge the way you act
You've played this part for way to long
Now the center stage is clear
Grab my wrist and hold it tight
Tell me nothing's left to fear...
I thought words could explain the way I feel
But now I know that's just a lie
Grab my wrist and hold it tight
I'm coming home tonight
When I go just leave the door unlocked
I'll make it worth my while
When the high gets low
And my conviction stands
Just look at me and smile...
