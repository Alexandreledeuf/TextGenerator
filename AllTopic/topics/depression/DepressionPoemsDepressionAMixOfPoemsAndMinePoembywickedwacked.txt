Depression is a fight
Depression is a flight
Depression is a thief
That should be locked up
Depression steals your view on life
And even your very life
It brings to you seclusion
Worse than that of a grave
And darkness
Worse than that of a cave
It keeps you away
It doesn’t allow you to be gay
It keeps you back
It doesn’t allow any comeback
It keeps you pressured
It keeps you shattered
It brings to you tearing tears
With depression there is no in-between
You’re in a dark tunnel
With no light to be seen
Depression we say is a selfish state of mind
But when we get depressed there is no other we can find
Depression is predator and we’re all its prey
Tick tock tick tock goes the clock
Its only a matter of time
Before the ultimate climb
