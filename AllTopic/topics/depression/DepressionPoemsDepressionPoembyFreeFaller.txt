Life is all lies
Borrowed for cries
Tears are all shy
Like wings that won't fly
Like eyes that won't see
Like lips that won't speak
Like lungs that won't breathe
Like freedom that's not free
It won't just pass through
It is really stuck on you
Like glue
Like gum on a shoe
It's like an eclipse
Let the words pass through your lips
Let the tears in your eyes stick
Making the stress in your mind slip
I know it's like being raped
Like all your thoughts are being taped
Like you have to keep your fists shaped
Like the tears in you have turned to rain
Well this whole thing is not your fault
Your life is not at a stop
There is a way to crack this vault
There is a word you could call
Your life is not all flat
There's a chance you could catch
There is a way, that is a fact
Depression is what caused all that
