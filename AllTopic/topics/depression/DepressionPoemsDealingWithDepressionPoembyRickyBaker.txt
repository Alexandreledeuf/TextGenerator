Depression is being lonely in a room full of people
Depression is being constantly tired but never able to sleep
Depression is longing to be with others yet not being able to cope with company
Depression makes you lose your appetite and eat yourself fat
Depression is smiling to hide the pain inside
Depression is when the soul dies but the body keeps on living
Depression is forgetting who you used to be
Depression is not knowing if you could survive without it
Depression is being sad when nothing is wrong
Depression is not caring whether you live or die
Depression is having no interest in the things you used to love
Depression is lying awake for hours in bed at night contemplating the best way to kill yourself only to realise that you canâ€™t be bothered.
