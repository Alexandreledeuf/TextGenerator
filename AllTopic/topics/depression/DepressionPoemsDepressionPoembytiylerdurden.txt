it tortures and consumes me
I can not see a way out
I scream and shout
It dwells within me
How can I stop this insanity
This truly dark thinking
I always end up drinking
Myself away
or is this just some weird vanity?
Darkness consumes
I feel used
the dark hand looms
Depression will it ever end?
