Depression is like a tidal wave pulling you further in
You don't feel upto facing anyone or anything
Depression is a huge emphasis on feeling sad and low
You feel like you're in a dark place with nowhere else to go
Depression is like you're falling deeper into a black hole
Your mind feels violated and as though you have no control
Depression is having little energy or lack of motivation
You feel tired and don't want to engage in conversation
Depression is used in the wrong context by naive people
They dont understand the seriousness of how it affects people
Depression is isolation, withdrawel, low self-esteem and more
You will never understand it unless you've been through it before
