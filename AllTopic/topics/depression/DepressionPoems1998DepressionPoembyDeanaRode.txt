Stab me with your rusty knives
I don't care
I've given up my quest for acceptance
Left my dream of peace
Cut me all your evil mind wants
I beg you to let me die
I want to lie here on the floor
Bleed to nothingness in the night
Perhaps then my soul will fly
Unite with the wind and muggy air
Feel the warmth of joy's arms
So do what you want to my useless heart
Chop me to pieces or burn me alive
If death is my only way to salvation
Then I want to open the darkened door now.
