Depression hits you
Like a ten-ton truck.
One minute you are down
Then you are up.
With depression
there is no in-between.
You are in a dark tunnel
with no light to be seen.
You try to pull through
Try to cheer up.
You are sick of people
telling you:
'Enough is enough.'
It's energy-sapping
And you're always feeling rough.
When you're feeling worthless
friends and family you can't trust.
They are hanging around
Making a scene.
You know that they are worried -
still - you want them to leave.
Depression
is a very selfish
'State of Mind'.
But when you got Depression
no other 'State' can you find
When people say to you:
'It's time to cheer up.'
That is when it hits you
Like a ten-ton truck...
