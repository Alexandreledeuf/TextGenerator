depression is when you are sucked into a cold lonely world
where you don't have anyone to love
no one by you're side
you wish you could die
cutting with tears
you want help but no one can say anything right
you're words are cold
depression leads you down a broken road
you keep walking forever down that road
you're heart is bleeding from all the pain people has caused
its a disease from people you love
they hurt you so bad and they act like they care
they don't know what its like being you
they never dealt with anything like this
depression pulls you under
drowning in you're own tears and blood
not even a single rose can fix whats been broken
you're so alone so far away from paradise
wishing that death would soon arrive
depression hurts like hell
