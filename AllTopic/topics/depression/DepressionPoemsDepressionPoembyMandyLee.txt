I'm scared that I have fallen,
into that rift yet once again.
The black hole that I had feared,
the one i rotted in as I lain.
Even worse to me is the thought,
that I never did ever climb out.
And all that I have been,
is merely a voiceless shout.
From a depth too far to reach,
in a land too far below.
A place I tried to run from,
Yet is a place I always go.
