Depression is the sorrow in your heart…
Depression is the feeling of being alone…
Depression is knowing your best isn’t enough…
Depression is knowing no one cares if your dead or alive…
Depression is the hate and anger you get when life is too hard…
Depression is when you feel like the worlds on your shoulders…
Depression is the feeling that you get when you get when you know
That what ever you do no one cares and it doesn’t matter…
Depression is knowing when you tried tried and tried again but failed…
Depression is knowing that when you are dead no one will even remember your name…
Depression hits hard and harder every day…
Depression is the feeling of dying slowly every day…
