The unnamed feelings
Eating me alive, and depression
Is lying inside....
As the thin dark ropes falling from the sky
The brown knots are dancing in front of my eyes
I quickly closed them and pray
'God, am I losing my mind? '
I hold my blade and cut my unloved wrist
It's bleeding still but I can't feel relief yet
I ran to the balcony as am looking down and wondering
If the height is enough to smash my head over the floor?
Will it be enough to break my out through this door?
The monster inside my head is calling my name
And asking me to suicide...
It screams inside and then orders me to die
Die dying...
You are not alive
Just cut it deeper and die...you don't want to survive
'God, I'm screaming for your help
I'm begging for a relief
A moment of inner peace
Did you forget me I'm still here living in this empty shell f grief
Can't you remember me....?
