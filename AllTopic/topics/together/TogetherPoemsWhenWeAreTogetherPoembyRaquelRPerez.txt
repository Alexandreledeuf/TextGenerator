When we are together,
we forget about the world
and we go into paradise
in a world of our own.
When we are together united
as one we speak no words
For our bodies say it all.
We take our time to explore
the wonders and rejoice the
moments when our bodies have
surrendered.
We laugh and we talk until
Our bodies refuel with our
passionate kisses and our
love so true, we continue
to explore the wonders in
a paradise of our own, a
place we call home, when we
are together.
