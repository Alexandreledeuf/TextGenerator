Why does mankind hate people based on religion and race?
Is it ignorance, education, or governments deciding our place.
For people are people regardless of the color of their face.
And the love in our hearts is an example of God's grace.
European people are the most powerful people under the sun.
Asians, Blacks, and Jews are constantly under the economic gun.
But people should not be exploited because of the color of skin.
White people must reject racism for a world of love to begin.
But are not Blacks, Jews, and Asians also guilty of racism?
For some of their religious leaders are advocates of separatism.
Now all people, whites, Asians, Jews,and Blacks, live on earth.
For racism will show God how much our souls are really worth.
All people will die and their bodies will stink becoming dirt.
And the devil will have the souls of all racist to forever hurt.
For Love is the most powerful force throughout the world.
Conquering all obstacles and causing racist minds to whirl.
We can't take money religion family or hate when we die.
But we can take love, and send it back to those who will cry.
For only love will cure any grieving and lonely heart.
And cause a no-good son or daughter to give life another start.
People are just human beings regardless of their ethnic pride.
So people should try to constantly look spiritually inside.
So forget about religion racism and discriminating government.
Because only Brotherhood will eliminate all bills and the rent.
