Let us you and me be together
living in happiness
and nothing would disturb us
whatsover.
Let us run away from this society
and live our life without worry
Let us get rid of this anxiety
and make a lovely story.
Nobody would keep you away from me
cause i will endlessly weep
till the tears turn to a sea
that would drown everything deep.
I wish our dreams come true
and one day be together
The only one that i love is you
and you will stay in my heart forever.
