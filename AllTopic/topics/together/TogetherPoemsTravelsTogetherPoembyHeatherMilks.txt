I could never be without you in our lives,
Because you are our life.
We are on a long voyage, a journey, a path that is uncharted.
There are hills that will tire us and valleys that will amaze us,
Cliffs that will frighten us and oceans that will almost overwhelm us,
There will be times for resting and healing our wounds
And time for working to just make it through,
We will ache and face sorrows,
As well as celebrate triumphs,
Some nights will be dark with nothing to guide us,
Others bright, as the moon will shine on us,
Days that are frigid that chill our deep bones,
Followed by afternoon breezes that warm our souls,
We will take turns, One can lead and one can follow
filling the other when hopes seem so hollow.
Mount Everest is a beast but well worth the climb
as life is a tower, we must follow time.
Today may not be the same as tomorrow,
it may bring us hope or it may bring us sorrow.
But one thing I know that I can assure you,
I promise you this, I never will leave you,
I may fall behind, or get far ahead,
But I will always wait, or catch up instead.
We are partners traveling together.
Even if we get lost we will still be in good company...
