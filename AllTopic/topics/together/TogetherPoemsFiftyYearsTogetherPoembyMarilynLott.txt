It was over fifty years ago
They met and something clicked
After all the folks they had met before
They found the perfect person to pick
Larry and Lois had a purpose
They knew the direction they’d go
Nothing would stand in their way
Because they loved each other so
So marriage was inevitable
In time the couple had three boys
Working together to raise their family
Patience was always employed
They took their vows seriously
Trudging down life’s worn pathway
Keeping that strong firm direction
Always meeting one another half way
Of course there were a few hills
And at times some stormy weather
But the main thing that was important
Was they climbed those hills together
And now those fifty years are past
And their happiness isn’t just a rumor
Their beautiful smiles are evidence
Along with a great sense of humor!
