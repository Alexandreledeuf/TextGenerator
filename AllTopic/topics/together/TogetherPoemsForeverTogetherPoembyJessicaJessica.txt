He's often sad, rarely smiles for a reason,
Heâ€™s always numb, even in the summer season.
He loves the cold, the wind and the rain,
He does not sleep, he's in so much pain.
He wants to leave this life behind,
But there is one girl who stays on his mind.
He tells her he loves her, then whispers goodbye,
He grabs the rope and hangs it up high.
Tears start to run as she grabs the knife,
And on that night they both took their life.
