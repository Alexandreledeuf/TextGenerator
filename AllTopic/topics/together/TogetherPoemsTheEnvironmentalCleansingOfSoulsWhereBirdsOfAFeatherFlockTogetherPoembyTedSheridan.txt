There were church bells ringing
and the sound of their beautiful music attracted
flocks of people who looked like pelicans and quail;
some with web feet and others with talons,
some with strong beaks and others with broken wings;
some came to sing and others came to dance
but all were in need of someone, someone to love
and care for them. And the church bells guided them
into the sanctuary of the Birdman; where they could
be washed and cleansed of the crude oil. Even those
who were like crows and whose sheer nature it was to
scavenge on the weak and dying, even they
had been thoroughly soaked in the evil sludge.
But blessed are all who call his name.
From the sparrow to the vulture,
by his promise all shall fly once more…
