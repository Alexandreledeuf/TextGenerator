I am bored
With love
And it's passionless limbs
That drape over my bed
In a lethargic state of impotence
While wearing the same red heart
My soul picked up
Hitchhiking off highway
Now here we are
Alone in togetherness
Trying to build dreams
With two by fours
And glue
But even a home
Won't tie us together
When our hearts
Live alone
Poetic vows clinched
Into nothingness
Like all words do
Eventually
And we allowed
Our bodies
To become another pair
Of hollow shadows
That make love
To a wall
Instead of each other
And we wonder why
The roses are dying
