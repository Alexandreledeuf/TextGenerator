Let us sing together, Love
I want you to drown in my songs, Love
And be lost in me...
But how do I sing...
My flute is only a hollow pipe
My harp is with broken strings
My numb fingers on my drum
Nor have I got a nightingale’s throat
Come and be with me, my Love
Let’s sing together...
from those unheard melodies
To fill our nights....
with the music of the stars
and the humming of the moonlight
To fill our days...
with the song of the breeze flirting with the flowers
and the murmur of the wind seducing the leaves to dance
Are you not listening, my Love
I am singing...
from the music of  raindrops falling on the grass
from the soft sound of buds blossoming into flowers
from the murmur of darkness embracing our love
and the soft sound of light enveloping us
And from the last dance of the falling leaves.....
A fleeting smile on your lips...?
Heard my songs, Love...?
Are you not intoxicated...
By the sweet and enchanting music of our love
