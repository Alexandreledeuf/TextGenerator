Love.
Indeed the strongest word ever.
Love + You = Our Life Together.
Now I know it's obvious.
That you love me more than ever.
Let's cut the small talk & be together.
On a candlelit evening.
I imagine us together.
Happiness & good weather.
All the good times with you get better & better.
But the bad times with you.
I'm still glad that we're together.
So love me in the morning, noon, and the evening.
Forever.
Always stay true to this.
And we'll always be together.
