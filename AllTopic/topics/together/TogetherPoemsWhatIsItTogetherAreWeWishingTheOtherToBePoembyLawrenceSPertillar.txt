If it isn't about me
Nor is this about you...
Then what on Earth are we attracted to?
If I like what I see...
And you say the same of me,
Then what is it together
Are we really seeking?
You say I don't listen,
To your scattered conversations.
I want to understand...
But you take off with new sensations.
And I'm to comprehend,
Which one ends before another begins?
If it isn't about me
Nor is this about you...
Then what on Earth are we attracted to?
This hasn't been mentioned...
But I think you are seeking attention.
And I wouldn't mind,
To receive that from you sometimes!
If I like what I see...
And you say the same of me,
Then what is it together
Are we wishing the other to be?
