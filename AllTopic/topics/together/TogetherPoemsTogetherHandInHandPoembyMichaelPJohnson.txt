“Be quick and give your chocolate kid
Or else you’ll feel my toe
Let’s stay off school and spend your quid
Don’t let your mother know
Well that was you! Remember how
You always played the fool?
But here you are a preacher now
From all us kids at school
So rough you were, you’d always fight
You used to pull my hair
You scratched my face. You’d kick and bite
My clothes; you’d often tear”
“Yes that was true, I’m sad to say
Though no one ever knew
When first I saw you kneel and pray
‘Twas I who envied you
I knew you always thought me rough
In truth! I’d just pretend
Outside I only acted tough
Because I had no friend
But praise the Lord, you’re preaching too!
Yet when I heard you phone
I gave no thought, that that was you!
Yet all to God was known”
“Yes looking back, it now seems odd
From you; I’d run a mile
But now we’re brothers serving God
And all we do is smile”
“I’m also pleased, I won’t pretend
Yet now; I understand
So come! Let’s praise God’s name dear friend
Together! Hand in hand…..
