We'll have a get together for to welcome the new year
And Jill will bring some sausages and John a slab of beer
And David will bring lamb chops and Jean a kilo of sirloin steaks or two
And we will have a sing song around the barbecue.
And Jan will bring some dessert for to have with our tea
And Ian will bring his guitar for to lead in the revelry
And Carol she will bring her voice she has the gift of song
And we'll all join in the chorus and with her sing along.
We'll have a get together come rain or hail or shine
And around the smoky barby we'll sing For Auld Lang Syne
The grub and grog won't cost us that much and the entertainment's free
And Joe will make us all laugh with his jocularity.
We'll have a get together and Jenny will be there
And the beautiful Belinda with blue eyes and golden hair
And foxy haired Jimmy Rucker one quite fond of his beer
A twenty year old who enjoys the party atmosphere.
And Fiveways Dave a happy sort now showing his years in gray
Will join our get together for to welcome New Year's Day
And we'll eat drink and make merry around the barbecue
And sing farewell to the old and welcome in the new.
