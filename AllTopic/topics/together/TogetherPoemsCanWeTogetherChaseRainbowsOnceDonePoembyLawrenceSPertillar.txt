What we use to do.
And what we now can find no time,
Together.
Chasing rainbows once done!
Neglecting the Sunrays...
To prefer sitting under clouds,
Expecting rain and thunder to come!
Did we welcome that?
And when did it begin?
I wish what we use to do,
Could return back to us again!
But that would mean,
We would have to forgive and forget!
And revive the love,
That swept us off our feet.
And remove the dirt...
Kept swept under the rug!
Can we together,
Chase rainbows once done?
Or are we here...
To victimize each other's dreams?
