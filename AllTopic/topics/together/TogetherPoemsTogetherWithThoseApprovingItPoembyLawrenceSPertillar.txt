If you are not sure what you are looking for...
What makes you think you are going to find it,
Stumbling through life?
If you can not identify what it is that makes you tick...
Why get on someone else's nerves,
Putting up with something you haven't dealt with?
There are many who blame others for what is not right,
In a world uptight!
Everyone is looking for solutions to 'quick fix'!
But few are willing to sit down to admit...
Pulling tricks out of a hat to create magic,
May be great for amusements...
To 'shock and awe' those who sit!
But this doesn't cure a search for purpose,
Or heal those in disturbing conflicts!
Because they find in their minds this is okay....
And gather together with those approving it!
