His eyes are fixated on her soul
Her scent lingers on his clothes
Her lips want nothing more than a kiss
His hands want nothing else but her
With nothing to say is every word
They're meant to be forever entwined
No matter the scene no matter the world
T'was love at first sight no plan no time
The beauty inside is for eyes he holds
Behind his looks what her heart desires
Only had he ever lusted and dreamt
Until this day she's in his arms
Didn't want her for lust or her sight
He wanted her heart he knew t'was right
He questioned not once on how he felt
He knew t'was love and nothing else
So pure and so gentle he'd never pick fights
Unless t'was for his lover his wife
Met young and grew old together hand in hand
They found their love in a grain of sand
It came out of nothing though some may say
It came from the stars where the moon doth lay
It came from their life their love in their hearts
Apassion in soul a love in an art
Together and always
Soulmates forever
