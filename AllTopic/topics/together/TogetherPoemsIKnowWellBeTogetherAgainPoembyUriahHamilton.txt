Neither the sun at noon
Or the soft breeze at dusk
Nor the dizzying midnight moon
Is required when I see you smile,
I’m child-like beside you,
Always whispering love
Into your ear,
Wanting you to hear
The rhythm of my heartbeats,
Never doubt what you mean to me,
I saw you growing up,
Adorable and dream-like and laughing
With your older sister,
And I cannot resist saying
Time has been your ally,
Your beautiful, feminine mystique
Only increases with intensity,
I know we’ll be together again
On café streets
Reciting sacred poetry
As small birds serenade us
On an avenue of trees.
