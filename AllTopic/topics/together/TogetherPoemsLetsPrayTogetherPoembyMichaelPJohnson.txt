Come join me now in prayer my friend
Unite our souls in praise
Together let our knees now bend
To The Ancient Of Days
In spirit let us be as one
Let’s bow before God’s throne
Let’s thank Him for the victory won
Upon The Tree alone
In gratitude let’s raise our voice
Let’s celebrate and sing
Let love within our hearts rejoice
That Christ is truly King
Salvation’s come in truth my friend
God’s Spirit dwells inside
Now life for us will never end
Beyond the great divide
Let’s pray our friends and families see
Our selfish world may hear
Let’s pray The Truth their souls will free
And learn their God to fear
Thank God that death has lost its sting
The devil’s seen defeat
That soon as if on eagle’s wing
We’ll join His royal elite
We’ll fight the fight as none before
In armour shining bright
With victory through our Father’s door
We’ll sit arrayed in light
Let’s praise The Lord for all He’s done
Let’s thank The Holy Dove
Let’s lift up high God’s Lamb & Son
And thank Him for His love
