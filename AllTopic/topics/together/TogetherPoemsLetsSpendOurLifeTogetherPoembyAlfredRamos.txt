The quiet moon in its entire splendor
Sails across the starlit sky so tender
I hold you in my arms tonight
Everything feels so right
Our love transcends into a higher plane
Hearts beating fast like a runaway train
I wouldn’t want it any other way
The moment’s right for what I got to say
Let’s spend our life together
Make the hours last forever
Let’s walk down the aisle together
I’ll promise to leave you never
Nothing can divide us
We have hope to guide us
That aura that surrounds us
Gives a glow that astounds us
All the colors of the rainbow shining through
Bringing paradise closer for me and you
Our love is elevated to the highest star
And getting there doesn’t seem very far
You came into my life like a flower
Full of color every waking hour
You came into my dreams like a butterfly
With kisses soft and sweet as pie
I get a fever of high alarms
When I wake up in your arms
Because you wake up all my senses
You break up all my defenses
Let’s spend our life together
Let’s dance the night away forever
Make happiness our new endeavor
Let’s spend our life together
