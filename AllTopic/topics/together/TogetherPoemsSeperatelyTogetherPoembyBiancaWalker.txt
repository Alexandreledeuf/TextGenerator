We arrived at our home that night separately in the same car.
He needed to speak.
I needed silence.
He needed time together.
I needed time alone.
He needed to prove a point.
I had nothing to prove.
He said he was leaving.
I said leave the key on the table.
He asked did I even care?
I just stared…
He glared…
He wanted to fight.
I had no fury.
I have nothing left…
We've been through this before.
Another battle in an on going war.
It's time to put down our bags,
And wave the flag.
Love did not win.
She may live deep within, but's it's too long of a journey to the surface.
He says I'm moody
And after all this time  he'scompletely blind
How? ? ? ? after 6 years can he not understand me?
We wasted so much time,
But still produced beautiful memories.
We don't have to ask what happened to us.
It happened...and now we will deal with it.
We'll heal.
Grieve.
Cuss.
Spit.
& blame.
Be ashamed, and have to explain,
to family and friends who will takes sides.
Your family will blame me because they can't see,
The side of you that lives with me, and vise versa...
It could've been something beautiful
I gave plentifully
But even completely, at times is not enough
We've tested the weather
Yet still live separately together
It's time to live completely alone.
