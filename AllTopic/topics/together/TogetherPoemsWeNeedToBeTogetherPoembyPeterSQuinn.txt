The hour is falling free
Into the reflections
Of going mood
Purpose and work about
For you and for me
River of words life's food
Everything coming to go
Passions of feelings loss
Enormous ways you'll know
Getting day's music across
The times of being here
In our answers to find
About the thoughts
We give and share
Through the echoes
Where we together
Are entwined
