Admire those who stood with beliefs undaunted.
Those who did not choose to flaunt correctness.
Or exposed a weakened disposition.
Some have rode as passengers...
Seated with sights that ignited clearer perceptions.
Others have been treated to a scenic view.
Either way...
All will arrive at the same destination.
Not at the same time!
However,
Everyone will have opportunities...
To describe their journey.
And the picture observed will no longer be in pieces!
Once complete and put together to share!
