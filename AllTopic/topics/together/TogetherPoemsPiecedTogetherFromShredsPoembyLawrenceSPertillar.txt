You say you don't understand,
What it is I am trying to convey?
And you read again and again...
Still not comprehending?
In a way you think,
What I've said should be understood...
For a quick dot connection,
To determine if it's bad or good!
To digest after reading?
For an analyst it...
Or I may be needing.
But I like the thought of bleeding...
A multiple meaning instead.
I love it when that double entendre is done!
And whatever I have said,
Gets to be a memory in one's head!
I'm not going to make an interpretation easy.
Especially after I have to sit and wonder...
What is 'it' that I mean?
And if I've said anything,
I may later dread.
This 'Rubik's Cube' of teasing thoughts...
Would be more acceptable,
If presented to readers...
Pieced together from shreds!
Maybe I should introduce,
A variety of colors one could use?
'Blue' would be confusion.
'Yellow'?
Too far off track to get!
'White'?
Neither one of us are right!
And 'red'?
Something has been fed...
That can put this 'mess' to bed!
