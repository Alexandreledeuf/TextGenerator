I hung the decorations
and I trimmed the christmas tree.
What really means the most of all
is that you're here with me.
You make the season special
without spending lots of dough.
Your neverending friendship
means more than you could know.
I can't say what it means to me
to share this special time.
I thank God for another year
that He's let you be mine.
Let's deck the halls and celebrate
with family and friends.
But, lets take time for you and me
before the season ends.
