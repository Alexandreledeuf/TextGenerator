Up in the sky
I wonder why
The clouds are fluffy and white.
Down on the ground
All safe and sound
The sun shines 'specially bright.
Out on the sea
I wish I could be
With you, wrong or right.
When I'm at home
My dreams often roam
And we're quietly alone together.
When I'm with you
All night through
I hope we'll be friends forever.
Why can't I see you?
Why can't I see you?
Why can't I see you? .
I hate being far
I hate being apart
But I hope I'll see you soon.
As soon as the sun shines over the moon
Then I'll see you,
I'll see you soon.
