We work together
We work as one
Though there may be times
When we don't 'get on'
We may not always
See 'eye to eye'
And sometimes we feel
Like saying 'good-bye'
When this happens
We shouldn't lose heart
For of 'something greater'
We are all a part
Each one of us
Has a role to play
In making this
A brighter day
We work together
For the good of all
It's in our hearts
Where we feel the call
Gods love lives within
Every heart that shares
and every soul
that really cares
So whenever you feel
like going away
Just listen to your heart
For it wants you to stay.
(Dedicated to all who work together for the benefit
of a Church community and for the 'Greater Good')
