There is not a stone that cannot be hauled,
There is not a crisis that cannot be solved.
Together we laugh, together we cry,
Together we live, together we fight.
United we stand to fight all odds,
United we cheer our victories out loud.
Together we shall rise, Yes we shall!
We move forward towards our goal,
We strive ahead as ONE and whole.
There is no stopping the fire in us,
There is no killing the life in us.
India is our land our heart and soul,
India shall fight back with all her force.
Together we shall rise, Yes we shall!
