Someone put me back together!
I seem to be falling all apart!
It started when my lover went away
leaving a hole in my chest
where once there had beat a heart.
I'm feeling like the Straw man
In the movie, the Wizard of Oz!
Where all of the straw mans straw parts
all fell off, his legs, his arms, his schnoz!
My head can't seem to stay up
my eyes are watering all the time!
My legs are weak, my smile is gone
I'm falling apart and my parts seem out of line!
Please someone put me back together!
so that I might live and love again!
Is there anyone out there who can help me?
Who might know how, to put me back together again.
