I see him as I walk in.
I see him looking at me.
He sees me looking at him, too.
He looks away instantly, and so do I.
Out the corner of my eye, I see him glancing at me.
He sees me looking again, and turns away, as do I.
I think we’re both embarrassed.
I noticed he was pretty cute, though.
I stand with my back to him, composing myself.
I turn round, and he’s stood ahead of me.
Looking at me,
like I’m looking at him.
I forget myself, and just lose myself in his big, blue eyes.
Big, blue eyes that hold me captivated,
and guide me through the gateway to his soul.
They reflect every emotion I knew existed.
Hurt, hatred, love and compassion.
Happiness, loneliness, pain and depression.
As a glimmer of an attraction shines,
I find myself smiling. He smiles with me.
Wow, that’s a killer smile.
I stand in front of him, openly staring,
and feeding the fire rumbling in me
with his gorgeous features.
My heart was racing,
but it couldn’t keep up with my thoughts.
Ideas and questions rushed haphazardly through my head
How do I tell him I like him?
Will he believe me?
I took one deep breath,
and spoke.
“Dan, pull yourself together, you look amazing, and there is nothing to be shy and self-conscious about. Get out there and knock ‘em dead! ”
