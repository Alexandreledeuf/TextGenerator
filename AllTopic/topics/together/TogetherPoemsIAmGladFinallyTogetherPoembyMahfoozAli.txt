I am glad you came into my life
At a time when I was lugubrious
And full with so much doleness
At times when I am feeling blue
All I have to do is just call you
but restrain
To tell you what's on my mind!
I like it when you see at me
Or to just play with my pen
to pen you a word
We spend so much time apart from each other
So now we can finally be together.
