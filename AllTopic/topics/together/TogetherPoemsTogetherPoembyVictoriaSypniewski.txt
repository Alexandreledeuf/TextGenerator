Under the moonlight
Together we'll lie
Held tightly in your arms
Together you and I
Alone
Together at last
How did I ever go on without you in my past
Each moment
Sweet kiss
I simply can't resist
Everytime you touch me
I feel comeplete
When our eyes meet
My hand is yours
Together
Walking along these shores
We're perfect for each other
A heavenly pair
We're just two people
Whose lives we can share
