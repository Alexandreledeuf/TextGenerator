My inability to fluctuate causes me to dissipate
Transient in nature but stolid in form
Panic unleashed, I hyperventilate
Moorings are broken, stability torn
From deep in a hole these changes accelerate
Blending and blurring the pieces within
No safe haven for me to extrapolate
No end in sight, nowhere to begin
I bow down to unity and flee from my sanity
Consciousness shared is one never lost
Striping me of my valued humanity
Solace in union at very high cost
