It seems the church is in a mess
This fact is nothing new
Each day she sees she’s growing less
But what on earth’s to do?
Allow my children air their views
Let wisdom, take command –1Ti.4: 11
Take care that no one should confuse –Pr.18: 2
Who fail to understand

What are the needs of every child?
How can their souls; be saved?
What hinders them, from running wild?
What makes them well behaved?
The King of kings can see it well

The gospel of His Light –Mt.28: 18-20
The truth’s not left to one alone –Ex.18: 17-26
Although ordained with oil
Yet ALL may help the plough to hone –Pr.27: 17
And dig beneath the soil –1Co.9: 10
So silence not, true lips that speak
Nor quench my Spirit’s flow –1Ti.5: 19
That you who come my face to seek
In unity; can grow…
