that beach where we sit together
beside the sea
where our hands stretch out
to be held again
like yesterday
is actually a vow, a promise
that never shall again
the sea and the earth part
like two lovers taking opposite ways
the sea licks the thighs of the earth
and the earth surrenders
in utter pleasure
