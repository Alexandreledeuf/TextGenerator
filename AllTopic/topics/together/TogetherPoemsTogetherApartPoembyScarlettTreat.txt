We're together...
But apart!
Together in body,
Apart in heart.
We have grown
Out of the love
Which we had
At the start.
Only the children
Hold us together,
And the lives
We live each day.
But when you lie beside me,
In our cold bed at night,
We just lie there, together, apart,
And nothing is right.
I long for what we had,
When all that we did,
We did together,
But your heart left me,
And we only remain
Together, Apart.
