I plunk at a beach,
silence herein,
I am, bit by bit,
shredded by winds
I pause all alone,
nowhere to go,
as if I were lost,
in a crossroad
Fall on my knees,
and it is you I see
dancing gracefully
in a place I can't be
Flash before me,
our memories,
I close my eyes
and it's I perceive,
But, piece by piece,
those memories,
fading away,
leaving me at a bay
Silence hurts me,
tears me apiece
but inside my heart,
there goes a story
won't ever last,
though my body
is torn apiece
by winds before me....
'All of our trance,
won't ever end
Until we can dance,
together again'
