Take me away with you my love
Let us go far away where the world is silent
Hold my heart close to your heart with love
Let us feel the beauty of love in our soul
When those stars make romantic nights
Let our hearts melt down with our deep emotions
When those nights bring moonlight on our body
Let us cover and roll with our 'love blanket'
When those trees dance with evening breeze
Let us dance with our world of dreams
When those ocean waves rolling high with sound
Let our heat waves touch our body with our feelings
When our arms around each others and makes us comfort
Let us give ourselves to each others for the endless love
Till those gates of the heaven open for us
Let you and me live in this world together forever
Ravi Sathasivam / Sri Lanka
