Beautiful are the days when we used to be together,
beautiful will be the days again when we will be together,
Every moment, every day which we spent together,
Will be always there as beautiful memories.
Time brings changes, time brings distance,
time is power, time is strength,
time decides where we will be,
Time decides when we will be together again.
Days since childhood,
We have always played, fought, cared  for each other.
Days in present we are still the same,
sharing every thought we have and every happiness and pain.
Still the strong bond of sisterhood,
tends to mean more than just sisters or friends.
Many still do find place in my heart,
But none can ever be replace in your place in my heart! ! !
