There's must be some hard times
As we're learning to give and to share.
But we'll find there strength
In every Prayer.
Like sweet Music we flow together.
Like a song that last forever
We share out love that's so much better,
Than this world could ever know.
We'll stay in-love
In love of the lasting kind,
That binds our hearts together.
That wont be over till forever.
Like the wind that keeps on blowing.
Like the star's that keep on glowing.
Like a river that keeps on flowing
Our love will surely grow.
