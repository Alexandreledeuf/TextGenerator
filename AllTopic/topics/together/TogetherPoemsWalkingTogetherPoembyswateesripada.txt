Long back
When you were you
And I was I
We walked together side by side
Trying to keep our thoughts
Hand in hand
Fumbling for sameness
And painting for an abstract future
We walked together awake or in slumber
Holding the thought of togetherness
In the midst of a vortex
Then
We walked together
Step in step
When I became you
And you became me
We walked miles together
Having together a sip of life
Even if it was sweet or elixir
Bitter or with venom
Tasting each other's tears
imaging inner souls and
flying high and falling down to hell
we walked together
Suddenly
a thought of teasing
you vanish as a dewdropp
but still we walk together
it's not for others but I feel your touch
holding my little finger
to transfer unseen strength
to complete the journey
we walk together
my slow steps in your long strides
my tired soul
getting consoled in your unseen hands
my feathery body
leaning on your shoulder
we walk together
day and night
till the twilight of life
we walk together
