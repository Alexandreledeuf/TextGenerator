Like a Captain and a Sinking Ship
Like a baby on Mamma's Tit
Like a SM Girl and her Whip
Or Crackers and Cheese Dip
Sticking Together like a Bird and it's Feather
Like a Biker and His Leather
Like a Girl and a Guy
Like Top-secret and a Spy
We should all stick Together
In all sorts of Weather
Like Mum and her Purse
For Better or Worse
