together through thick and thin
together till the end
nothing can come between
im sure you know what i mean
from the first time you said hi
i felt my heart begin to fly
and the fact that your around
i find it hard just to frown
as your with me for a while
all i can give is a smile
as you leave to go home
i began to feel all alone
but i know it's not for long
though to me it's a sad sad song
together we'll be together we'll stay
that is all i want you to say
