Joy
In the birdsong
At dawn;
In the little children's laughter
At play.
Faith
In the eye that waits
To see the homecoming;
In the anticipation
Of a smile coming one's way.
Hope
As that angel,
Hidden, yet guiding, always;
With a knowledge of a light
At the tunnel's end.
And Love-
Yes, Love, that culmination
Of emotion, glad and sad.
That surrender,
To the soul,
And soulmate.
It was with an
Unextinguished hope,
And the certain faith,
That I found that
Simple Joy-
When Love came calling,
With you.
As you!
