Can u hear the squeals of laughter,
the laugh i laughed when i was a little girl?
The princess i wanted to grow into
The prince i would never find.
I never learn my lessons,
I gave up looking for reasons,
rushing by me are all the seasons,
cant hold myself together,
breaking into a million pieces.
I always wanted the sun to shine
I never wanted to cross the line
but baby u left me without the sun
and tied my laces so that I could not run.
I laugh when my heart cries
the sadness I feel it denies
the truth is like a dream
that would make anyone scream
In all this nightmare is a life
which I live now and then
I dream of love and happiness
tears of joy running down my eyes
I dream of kites flying  high in the sky
which I cant reach no matter how hard i try
iam a little girl scared of the monsters under my bed
somehow they crawled up and got into my head
'god you are so beautiful' they say
I am gonna love you all the way
but darling cant you see
you love yourself more than me
I bleed where you have cut me
I hurt where you have hit me
you wipe your hands and look surprised
when I lay broken and bleeding by your side
Wish I could run and hide
reach a day where there would be no tomorrow
believe me when i say
please please please don't go away
Wish I could make more sense
build up more in my defense
wish I could turn off this living
that would end this heart's grieving
And when Iam gone the world will move on
at my grave the flowers will dry
the earth my mother and water my father
I am safe and my soul heals in the tomb.
