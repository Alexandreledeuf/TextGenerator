War. And war some more.
War. And war some more.
No one knows,
What it's for,
War. And war some more.
The images seem
To rule the day,
War and Generals,
All the same,
All the answers,
Seem so lame,
All our reason,
Gone insane.
War. And war some more.
War. And war some more.
No one knows,
What it's for,
War. And war some more.
