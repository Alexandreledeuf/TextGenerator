There was peace
before there was war
that's when two parties
fight for 'peace'
and after the war
there are two losers
though one believes itself
the winner
and perhaps that
is the most dangerous belief
and which god ever
declared war on men?
if every woman in the world
refused war
the men would not have a chance in hell
the hell of their own making
