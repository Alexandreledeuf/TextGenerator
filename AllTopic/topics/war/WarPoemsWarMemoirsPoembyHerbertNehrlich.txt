Over at the river's bank
stands my buddy, Mellow Frank,
thinking of the German Tank
that he observed right where it sank
they saved the captain, what a crank
he chewed tobacco and he stank
with two policemen at his flank
the one a colonel, just by rank
his stare was serious, almost blank
the younger cop, looked like he shrank
from the 3 stars of higher rank
his name tag showed him to be Hank
the captain of the ship said 'WanK'
he'd set his sail at Bitterlenk.
