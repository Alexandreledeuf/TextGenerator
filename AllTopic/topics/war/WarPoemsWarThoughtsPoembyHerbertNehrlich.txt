Roland cannot go to school,
his brother needs the trousers,
for shorts the weather is too cool
no clothes for rabblerousers.
The war was won by others, yup
the piper must be paid
I'll go around with paper cup
no longer so afraid.
We did respond to his Sieg Heil
yes all of us were proud
my brother walked the final mile
the cannon shot was loud.
Mankind has surely, truly learned
from all atrocities,
perhaps so many bodies burned
for man to have his peace.
