War is Peace
Peace is War
War unites against
One common enemy
Peace tears apart
A dream-like society
The fear during War
Gives control to the government
The calmness of Peace
Lets your guard down with sentiment
War causes death
Physically, Statistically
Peace ends life
Emotionally, Personally
War is Peace
Peace is War
