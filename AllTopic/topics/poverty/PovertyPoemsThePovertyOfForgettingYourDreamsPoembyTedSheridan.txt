Profit and loss sheets are spread
separated by hyperboles and conjectures
upon my desktop and the poverty of my brain
As I try to amass some common sense approach
To what it all means to me
Reduced receivables don't add up
and one must make the deductions
for the ever rising cost of raw materials
Discount specials on an inventory of older dreams
I seem to have forgotten my humble beginnings
When I loved Life and not the Dollar....
