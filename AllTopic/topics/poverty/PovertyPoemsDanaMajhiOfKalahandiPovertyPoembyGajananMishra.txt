Nothing wrong has been done
By Dana Majhi of Kalahandi.
He has just taken away
On his shoulder,
The dead body of his wife.
The sweetheart of Dana Majhi,
As you know, died in TB
At the hospital.
But let me ask a question
Why you people are so much
Worried about the incidents?
It is because something
Wrong is there within you,
It is because you are enjoying
Your life, at the cost of the people
And doing no welfare acts so far.
Remember, the summum bonum of life
Is situated in the loving service
Of the people in any set up of Govt.
You are seeking happiness, true,
By employing your senses
In the modes of materialism,
And you are not satisfied.
It is true, you engage yourself
In various philanthropic and
Altruistic works and all fail to
Give you satisfaction.
It is happening only due to
Your own childish innocence,
You are by nature eternal servitor
Of the people and you are
Taking away everything from
The common men like Dana Majhi,
And knowingly and unknowingly
Not providing the basic needs.
