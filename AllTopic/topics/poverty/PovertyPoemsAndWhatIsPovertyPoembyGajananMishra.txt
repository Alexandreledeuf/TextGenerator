And what is poverty
In which we are busy
in discussing so much?
Is not poverty lacking of faith?
Has it some friend and
if yes who are they?
We are fully aware
poverty is nothing
But a mental status
So long as we are telling
we have brain,
Let the brain in its way.
And we are in our world
With every richness with us.
