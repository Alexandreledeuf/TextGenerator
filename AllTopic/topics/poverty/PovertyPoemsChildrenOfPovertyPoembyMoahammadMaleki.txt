Arrows of poverty darting from throes
Thorns of destitution germinating from thrones
Flood of orphans sprouting on ghettos of misery
Torrents of waifs are pouring out from poverty-stricken outskirts of melancholy
Usurped future awaits them to heap upon their plights reprieved
Kingdom of agony is their permanent cottages of lights bereaved
Freezing winters and searing summers passing by
Infants of heedless justice praying with weep and cry
Begging god for walking on meadows of unceasing happiness
Yearning for unfading dreams of incessant caress
They are mere innocent victims of hostilities
Deprived of even vital facilities
Malnutrition wreaking withdrawl of stomachs on waists of threadbare bait
Refrigerators are deserts of poignant barren fate
Eradication of poverty is ridiculous mottoes of powers
We should take a determined action to raze this FATAL pestilence of populace.
