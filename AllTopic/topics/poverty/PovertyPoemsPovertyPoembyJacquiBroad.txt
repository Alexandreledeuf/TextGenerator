Every night you question your poverty,
while rich people enjoy their frivolity.
To you life just doesn't seem fair,
you being left in ashes and despair.
But every once in a while, you'll see
Lady Luck might just choose you to be
On top of the world, then you feel alone,
'cause to be like them, your heart must be of stone.
I'd rather eat my piece of bread,
than drink the blood of others instead.
I'd rather have my glass of life,
than stab my fellow travellers with a knife.
I'd rather enjoy my poverty in peace,
than beg for mercy on my knees...
