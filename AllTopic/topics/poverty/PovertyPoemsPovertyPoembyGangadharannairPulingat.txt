Eradication of poverty all over the world
A must and justice to the people
Poverty is not at all a curse or to blame
It is surely the system's failure in sharing.
Poverty the most dreaded thing to experience
To a thinking mind to live without food
Or to the barest minimum of necessities
where it is denied is a cruel thing to experience
Blame the world of poverty and try for corrections
Share the resources to such an equality
At least for two square meals a day
And minimum necessities that humans want
Respect the human being and its dignity all over
Surely poverty is the most objectionable thing
The confidence of life losing in its bottom lines
The unhelpful society accuses the poverty as fate.
The world is so improved in living conditions
But the system  in sharing is rotten and old
Change those inequalities in perfect peace
Allowing the human life more possibilities and change.
Life is short and human life is precious
Only the world order can save the humans
The world is fully capable to look after
If there is a perfect world with change of mind
Contentment, kindness, and humanity be preserved.
