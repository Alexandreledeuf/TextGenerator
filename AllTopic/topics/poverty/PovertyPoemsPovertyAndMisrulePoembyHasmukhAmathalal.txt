Poverty and misrule
Wolves are same all over
You need to think it over
Liberty and freedom
Go together seldom
Under the same name
People gang up to come
In power and try to rule
Rest all people watch them as fool
Poor shall suffer more
As restrictions shall not be over
Their freedom of expression shall remain on paper
They will remain free but facing starvation and hunger
Africa has natural sources in abundance
Now you have got chance
Rise above pretty considerations
And exert pressure as an independent nation
If no resistance is offered
Or awareness is created
You shall be kept under control
To face poverty and misrule
