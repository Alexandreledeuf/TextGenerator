The horrific specter called Poverty,
Ruining most illustrious of men;
Denying them much of their liberty;
Suppressing talents and scholastic ken.
The snow-balling avalanche that kills man,
Great scholars, scientists, poets, genius;
Putting them to death in her lionâ€™s den,
Humiliation caused by an empty purse!
Oh, how the nightmare can affect these minds!
Sucking the sap of life in a few years;
Perpetually haunting them, it binds
To destroy sometimes, the souls of some seers.
Poverty generates great Poetry!
How can man live by writing poems free?
