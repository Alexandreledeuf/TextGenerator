Not every beggar is a poor man or                                     A poor woman anytime...                                              Not every poor man is a beggar                                        Anytime...                                                           Beggars versus poor people...                                        Poor people never beg for money or                                    Anything anytime...                                                  Beggary is a bad deed that makes                                      Someone behaves badly and unwisely...                                Poverty is not beggary and beggary                                    Is not poverty anytime...                                            Beggars are mostly greedy and liars                                   Simply because they beg for their                                     Greed and not for their poverty...                                   Most poor people never beg for money                                  And for anything else in life...                                     Poverty is not a mistake, but beggary                                 Is a grave, ugly, and bad mistake...                                 Most of those who beg don't need                                      To beg anytime simply because they                                    Are greedy anywhere and everywhere...
