Havoc being played upon an earth of people as they struggle
to live from day to day.
Making ends meet is no longer a tangible way of being.
Government has crept and cramped our lives with their inane
rules and greediness, tossing everyone onto waves of
homelessness and poverty, causing more violence, as people
try to adjust to an existence of mere simplicity.
CEO's, financiers, bankers, politicians and developers have
put us into a tailspin of economic recession and are now
expecting the American public to bail them out of their
extravagant ways of life - lives that they were/are living
at our expense.
Who's going to help us as we live on edges of the little we
have left?
We don't see anyone waiting in line to hand us money - not
even to exist on.
