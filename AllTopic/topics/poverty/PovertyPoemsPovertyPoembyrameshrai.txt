Poverty is the curse of life
but some time it is gift for life
if you have no car
you cover your distance
on foot or by public means
you have no mobile phone
you are saved
from unnecessary calls
and will save time
but now-a-days
every one has got
Due to lack of money
you can not take rich food
you are saved from unforeseen disease
like sugar, high blood pressure etc.
if you have enough money
you will always be thinking
for better investment
you can hardly spare your time
to attend church, temple, mosque etc
you will be deprived
from attachment of God
if you have money
more than your requirement
donate humbly and generously
for charity
Money is the means
not the matter
do not run behind money
let the money run behind you.
(Do not run behind money - i mean to say not to earn money by evil means)
