Keeps away poverty
Make no mistakes
You shall stake
No claim over mishaps
That shall be called slap on your face
Make any overture
In future
Against our supreme creator
You shall be buried further
No one shall extend aid
You will be laid deep below
With no memory for contribution
You shall be gone forever from relation bond
God has created position
For us to live with jubilation
As life was to be called precious
And all souls to be called generous
Owe thanks to an almighty
As he is full of mercy
With all powers to grant prosperity
Long life and keep away poverty
