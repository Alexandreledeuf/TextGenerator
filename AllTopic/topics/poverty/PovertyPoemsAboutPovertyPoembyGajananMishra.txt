We are proud to say we are poor
We are telling about our poverty
We are getting nowhere.
We want to help the poor
By eliminating them from this geography
Basically we know not anything.
Giving the poor free rice free vegetables
Free fruits free clothing free house and food bill
What we want to do we know not, it is but to kill.
Know the poor know poverty all around the world
Come to their rescue care for the common poor people
No show nothing, no hypocrisy would help anybody.
