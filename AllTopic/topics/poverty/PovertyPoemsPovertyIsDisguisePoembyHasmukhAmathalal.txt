Poverty is disguise in blessings
In the sense it has essential feature of tracing
Happiness and joy to which his fortune might lay
And that may keep his spirit up to find the way
Many might have experienced it and felt the burden
With long and hard struggle they might have overcome even
Yet that deep scar and challenges remind everyday
That life is formidable task to overcome and have the sway
The first challenge comes from social environment
You face rough weather from own people with unbearable comments
“See that poor family living barely from hand to mouth “
“They have no social standing”so on and so forth
This is one of saddest stage that makes human being to struggle more
Strong resolves to survive and continue to work hard therefore
With only one aim in life to overcome poverty
And bring the family at par with the blessings from almighty
“No seasons remain permanent” the legendary saying goes on
“Ups and down” in life vanishes the moment fortune makes turn
The opportunity lays open and final score is made
Life smiles at individual and excels in trade
We hear and read successive stories
How big and successful people had faced miseries?
How had they overcome and what was the inspiration?
This all makes us to strive hard and remain in race without any question
