When I went to orphan house I met lot of children
They didn't see their mother nor did their Father
They don't know about god and his kingdom
Yet, in their life frustration, irritation and annoyance dances
Vexation, desperation, and grievance romances
They die in living; they live in dying daily 24/7
â€œI have no source of income, yet tears come
I cannot manage my life but only rummage sings a boy
I'm touching the lowest glory as he is not a donor
I have no house but I'm poverty's honour
I know I'm suppressed when my rights are denied and no joy
They die in living; they live in dying daily 24/7
My heart melts like a candle and camphor
I'm a life to good and I will give food
I'm a friend to all sings man very tall he stood
As soon he climbed the ladder and latter!
He drowned all of us in water without any matter!
They die in living; they live in dying daily 24/7
