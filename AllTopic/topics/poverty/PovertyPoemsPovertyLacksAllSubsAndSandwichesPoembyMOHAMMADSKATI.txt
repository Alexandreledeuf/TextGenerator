Poor people can not eat                                               All kinds of subs and sandwiches                                          Simply because they don't have money                                       To buy them anytime, anywhere, and everywhere,                               They can not eat any kind of fast food,                                    Cooked food, or any kind of food, but                                   They can eat only ready-made food from the garbage                        Or left food on the sidewalks,                                           They don't eat good foods because simply they can't                            Buy any kind of food anytime, anywhere, and everywhere,                  I went everywhere in our pretty world and I saw these                    Poor people eating from the garbage and they go inside                    Just to pick some left food,                                             These poor people when they pick the left or thrown food                   In the garbage or on the sidewalks and these people look                     Like birds picking their food in the same way,                                   The poor people regretfully can't get good food because                     They are poor and they have no choice at all anytime,                   Poor people suffer simply because they lack money and they                 Lack the world's attention though some people have a lot of food,    Our world is greatly unfair about the poor people and may be           Not caring about the poor and their abject poverty anytime, and       Greatly all the world is surely responsible directly or indirectly    Towards all the poor people anywhere, everywhere, and anywhere.
