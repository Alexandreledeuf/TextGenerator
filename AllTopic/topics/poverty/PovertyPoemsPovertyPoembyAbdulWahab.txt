I am a proud man
Not because of my wealth
But for my poverty which provides me
Lots of ideas and thoughts
And helps me to delve into my life
To fetch out some rich philosophies
And break into a way to lead a   life, contended
Without those banal luxury
Moreover I am trilled to think
That in life love and peace
Never dependent on materials
If they are in abundance or in scarcity.
