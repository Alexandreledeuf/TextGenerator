There's smoke in the air
I walk stupefied;
For, I just witnessed a horrendous sight.
A thin, weakling child, clinging to an equally young mother.
I wonder at God's justice,
To the well-fed, he does not give children and to this beggarly girl (I couldn't muster strength enough to call her a woman) a child at such a young age!
Why O God! this disparity?
To one who cannot feed; a child at such a young age, and to those who can give all the joys of this world,
No children.
