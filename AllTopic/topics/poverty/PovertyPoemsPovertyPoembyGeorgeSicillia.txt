When we talk each other
As a subject and object
Not as a brother and sister
That is poverty
When there's an empty space between us
Could only be stepped in
by your permit and requirements
That is poverty
When there's a ToR you decided on man
By annoying the value of him
And fact that we are all equal
That is poverty
And the poverty is
My plea to God
in times you put me on debat
and neglect my wounded heart
