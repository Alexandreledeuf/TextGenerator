This animal is there,
Waiting with cruel claws,
The teeth are sharp,
Always hungry and vigil,
Eating all our flesh,
Leaving us in skeletal structure,
This animal likes the shout,
As our cries are the lullabies,
It never sleeps, but pretends to be quiet,
It sucks our blood for its thirst,
Our sisters grow beautiful,
Our brothers are handsome and bold,
They are disturbed by this animal,
Whenever they go out for survival,
Brains are the factories of sorrows,
Before we reach our rice pots,
This animal regularly eat the last morsel,
Millions of people eat a meal a day,
As long as this animal is happy and gay,
where the human are careless and weak,
This animal is very strong and in attack mode.
