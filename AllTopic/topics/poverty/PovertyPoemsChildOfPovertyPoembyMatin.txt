It's so strange.
They speak about it.
Pizza! burgers! chicken! meat!
I don't know what 'delicious' means!
I don't know what 'over weighting' is!
I just know what 'skinny' is
Everyone calls me like this.
My food is great, wonderful!
Eating this way needs no rule
I won't eat anything instead
Here it is; water & bread!
Last night doctor told my dad:
'your child needs some protein'
But  dad needs his money for
Some more drug & heroin.
We were penniless, dad was sad.
Poverty made him truly mad.
Addiction came and kindness went.
Our home is a carton tent!
In fact only God can mend
My wounds with the looks he sends.
I'm the child of poverty,
Hunger is my only friend.
