How I loved you the day you were born
How I loved you growing into a beautiful woman
How much I wanted the best for you
Now I love what you have become
I watched you bloom like a beautiful flower
You nourished my life with your presence
You made me feel secure in my love
I am so proud of who you are
You taught me so much
Often it was not easy
We suffered in sorrow together
I was the tree…you were the strong branch
Now you have become the tree
Now, you are a mother yourself
Now a mother’s love you can see
I thank God you are a part of me forever
You are only one day older than you were yesterday
Your birthday reminds us to celebrate your life
Be joyful, be fruitful, be peaceful, and be healthy
Happy Birthday daughter…and many more to come
