I thank God for giving me a sweet and loving papa
Today is your 50th birthday that means so much to me
Let fifty candles glow on a cake of delight
That you blew them off to forget the past
Papa, you are special person to me in my life
and nothing will replace my papa in this world
Your loving nature brings me happiness into my heart
and you made me so proud with your lessons
I pray God for you to live many years papa
and my tight hugs and kisses on your cheeks
Happy birthday my ever loving papa
May God bless you papa always
