Some years ago
A star was born
A beautiful girl
With a heart so warm
You grew into a woamn
A wonderful sight to see
I still get so excited
When ever you look at me
Another year has quickly passed
But you don't show your age
Its just another verse for you
To write down on a page
The book of life you're writing
Is a continuing story
The pages in your book
I'm sure are filled with glory
As your day approaches
I wanted to send you a cheer
I hope for your next birthday
I can somwhow be near
So, have a Happy Birthday
For you deserve the best
This is not just something
That I say in jest
From my heart I truly mean it
I hope your day is great
I hope my Birthday wish for you
Does not arrive too late
