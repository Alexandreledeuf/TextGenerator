Is there always a happy ending,
to every song and a story.
Some are happy, and others weep,
and then there are those,
that finish in glory.
Is there a happy ending, to every day,
maybe not, when your filled with grief
and it's not stopped raining,
and the sky is grey.
Happy endings are made by you
it's how you  work, and go about it,
can make that ending come true..
Just be yourself, however small,
and smile when things get out of tune,
a happy ending, can be found.
Then life becomes, just one honeymoon
