There's nothing wrong with me
...I'm happy
I live life to wake each day
...and be happy
i want to enjoy it in each and every way
...and be happy
I feel content to be here now
...i'm very happy
To be depressed i wouldn't know how
...because i'm happy
i walk each day with a smile on my face
...yep, because i'm happy
i don't like to cry or be sad
...because my life is happy
i think being miserable, is what makes people lives bad
...so, you guessed it, i'm happy
are you? =]
