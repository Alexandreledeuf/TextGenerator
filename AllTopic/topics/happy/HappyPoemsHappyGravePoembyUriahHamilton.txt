My lovely kitten,
Eternity kissed,
You brought miracle joy
With your beaming brown eyes;
You delivered visions,
You let the mind drift
Into esoteric meditations
Like satellites
Into planetary explorations;
I now find God in mysterious dreams
Where door locks unbolt
By the power of psychic thoughts.
Angelic love beings
Float through the atmosphere
Like mystical feathers;
There is an invisible caress,
Felt nonetheless,
It finds me when I’m lost,
Helps me when
I’m darkness depressed.
I will fling death
Into a happy grave
And live forever!
