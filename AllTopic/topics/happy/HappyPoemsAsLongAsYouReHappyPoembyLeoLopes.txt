Today i met a lonely girl
with a touch of magic
i've been waiting for someone like her
I'm so happy
She let's me know of her love
i give her all of mine
My Angel sent from above
i tell her all the time cause i'm so happy
Now what was once 2 lonely souls
tonight we sleep, arms in arms
i found someone to love and hold
i wonder if she's happy
Love is here, just in time
my dark world has begun to shine
wherever i go, i want her near
cause she's what makes me happy
How long will this love last?
still can't believe she's mine
So attractive with a past so tragic
i'll do anything for her just as long as she's happy
She seems to hold and kiss me less
i feel so cold, her lips are blessed
i hope she never strays from me
she's what keeps me happy
She wants to free, it's in her eyes
Away from me, let her decide
an eclipse is what she sees in mine
cause love has made me happy
Then came the day, i lost my heart
she's gone away, forever we part
I find myself back in the dark
where nobody can be happy
I would hold you in my arms
No other hand in my palms
i thought the love of ours would last
she wants me to be happy
Forget about me
life has been tragic
im'a wait in the rain for you
just to see you happy
I'm stuck in a world where demons grab me
They stab me
...but im'a wait in the rain for you
As long as you're happy
