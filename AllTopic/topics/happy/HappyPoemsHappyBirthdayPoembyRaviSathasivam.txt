Birthdays comes and goes in every year
but few remains with us as golden memories
Its a special day to celebrate with loved ones
Although, the years carry our age away
but every aged year brings happiness into our heart
Life is full of ups and down, weary or teary
but life goes always with smile instead of frown
The candles have been blown off to say good bye to old year
and then the cakes is cut to say welcome to new age
The birthday song sung to forget the world
and the birthday wishes keep pouring to live more
When the birthday gifts are overflowing on the table
and impatient face is glowing to open them.
Dine and wine are served unlimited
Music followed by dance to remember unforgettable day
'Happy Birthday To You' that is last words that we hear
from each and everyone and again the drums are silent
for another year to come.
