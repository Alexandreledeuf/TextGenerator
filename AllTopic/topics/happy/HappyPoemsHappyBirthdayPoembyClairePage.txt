Happy Birthday to you,
Pure Poetry is a year old today,
All the sixty-one members seem to love you,
Because we keep putting poems on you,
Even the youngt members do too.
Members do find it hard to write poems,
But we do,
So happy birthday to you,
Hope you go on for another year,
So members can still write poems on you.
