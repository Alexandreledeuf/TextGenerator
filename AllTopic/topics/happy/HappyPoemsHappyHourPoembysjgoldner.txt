my dad hides his whiskey
in the toy closet
beside the plastic planes
and under the fake grenades
he hides the gin
beneath the book shelves
where Frank and Joe Hardy
catch their first underage
the vodka
he gently places
behind the outside freezer
next to boxes, crates and forgotten chores
but the scotch,
the scotch he keeps near the kitchen
to grab on his way
..............................to the nuts in the cupboard.
