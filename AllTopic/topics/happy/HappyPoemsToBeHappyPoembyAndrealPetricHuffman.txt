To be happy
Is to be happy with oneself.
To be happy
Is to be free with your thoughts and aspirations.
To be happy with oneself
Is to have that inner peace of mind acceptable to change,
Being able to play your part in life's forever changing game.
To be sad with life
Is to be discourage with life.
Do not be discouraged
Be encouraged
To have no cares no worries.
So be happy
Life is a colorful growing tree
Which leaves change colors everyday.
Find your color and grow your tree
To be all you can be.
