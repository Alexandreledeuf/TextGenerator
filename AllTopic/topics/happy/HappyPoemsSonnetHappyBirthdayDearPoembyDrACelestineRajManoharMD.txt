Your birthday is a special day to you,
That brings fond memories of your earthly birth,
And thoughts of expectations high, anew;
It is a day you grow older with mirth!
With each birthday, you feel wiser and bright:
That success in your life is somewhat near;
You make your mind to continue your fight,
And try to live your life without much fear.
â€™Tis good to celebrate one more birthday;
Thank God for His kindness, protection, love;
Abide in Him and fervently do pray;
Our earthly life should markedly improve!
But never feel sadder on your birthday;
Feel proud to walk beside God in His way.
