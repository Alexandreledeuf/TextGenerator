It's true that in one life
One can't achieve what he wishes,
Or can reach his goal.
It's true, fire in cold may take lives.
And water drowns if it flows over head.
Still, life never bans fire and water.
Hope and despair dancing between sunshine and rain,
Never stop us to move forward.
We cry, we laugh, we fall, we rise,
We hug life to say yes to death.
None is foe, none is enemy,
Alone we come, alone we go.
Keeping a chuckle on our lips,
We must say, may happiness lie everywhere,
In everyone's life....
HAPPY HAPPY NEW YEAR Friends.
