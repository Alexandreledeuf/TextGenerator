A prickly and wise Huckleberry
likes his Scotch so much better than Sherry.
He is still full of tricks
at a young seventy-six
Happy Birthday, my ancient friend Jerry.
As your poems show all of us clearly
you can stray into nomansland nearly,
and the wisdom of age
is on every page.
All your friends (and some foes)  love you dearly.
You could well be a mover and shaker,
but not ever a phoney or faker.
So please blow  out the flames
to please all of the dames
and the overworked candlestickmaker.
