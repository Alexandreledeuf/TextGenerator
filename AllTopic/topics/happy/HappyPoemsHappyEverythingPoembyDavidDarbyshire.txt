I'd love to wish you,
'happy everything',
I want to kiss you,
'bless everything'
I need to sing,
'Happy everything'
I want to shout,
'Happy everything', to you
The sun is out,
bright blue is the sky.
nothing out of place, were all gonna try
'Happy everything'
People sing.......'Happy everything'
The priest chant..'Happy everything'
The kids cry........'Happy everything'
Everyone wants..'Happy everything'
Everything is happy,
we are all so glad.
Everything is happy,
please don't be so sad.
