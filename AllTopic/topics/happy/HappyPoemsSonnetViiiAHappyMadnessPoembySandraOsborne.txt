Happiness. Can’t say I’ve ever had it.
Once I met a gleaming happy person,
He was beaming as he asked me to sit,
Said he would tell me how to have some fun.
Said he never worried at all for others,
Said he never cared for the world at all,
Said no man in the world was his brother
Said he never cared for the ones who fall.
Said you can’t be happy with that worry,
Said to be happy, to do as he said.
Said life is short and gone in a hurry,
Said no one remembers you when you’re dead.
So I told him then I’d rather be sad,
He wasn’t happy, instead he was Mad.
