Thousands of miles away
Once again, it's fookin' Mother's Day!
You and I don't talk,
You're mad at me while I refuse to bawk!
I'd love to be able to call you,
To tell you, I'll always love you,
That I'm proud to be your daughter...
I'd love to have you in my life,
Let you know, I'll soon be someone's wife,
To show you what kind of woman I've become,
I have you meet the man I find most handsome.
Being your daughter, I must say it truly sadens my heart,
Our lives being so far apart.
If I was to call, I'd wind up crying
Screaming and throwing the phone up against the wall,
Guess it's a good thing there's no laws,
Or else i'd be charged for phone~slaughter!
Guilty on the first degree....
Like mother like daughter!
Hope that one day you'll see that,
Regardless of our differences
I really do love and miss you.
I still hold a special place for you in my heart,
Even though our DNA's the only thing we have in common,
Maybe next Mother's Day we wont be so far apart.
Happy Mother's Day Mom! Love you!
