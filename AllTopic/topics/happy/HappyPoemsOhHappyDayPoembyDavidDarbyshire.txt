Last day of school,
going to the pool.
First day of spring.
Didn't get a bee sting.
Birth of a first born child,
weathers going to be mild.
All the home work is done,
My football team just won.
The war is over,
poppies in the clover.
Our chicken laid an egg,
Got money don't have to beg.
End of the week, it's Friday.
Girl friend got her Bouquet.
Oh Oh what a Happy Day
On holiday, goin away......
Going to be happy and free,
And Jesus Love's Me.
