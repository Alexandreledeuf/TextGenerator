To: Denis Joe.........
How did I miss your birthday?
You should have let me know!
Cause then I would have thanked you
for the kindness that you show.
You always have a nice note
to leave below a poem.
Your name is always welcomed
in my heart and in my home.
I love the way you give advice
with such a touch of class.
I wish I would have known before
your birthday came to pass.
Your topics of discussion
have become a simple treasure.
Your wisdom and your intellect
is something we can't measure.
I hope you enjoyed your birthday
and I wish you many more.
Get ready for a wonderful year!
You never know what's in store!
