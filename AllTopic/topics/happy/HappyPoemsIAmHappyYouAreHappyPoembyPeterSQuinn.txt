I am happy,
You are happy,
We are happy to be both here;
It's so lovely,
Yes so lovely,
It's summertime in the air.
When a bloom's born in spring,
See how lovely it becomes,
With your heart along sing,
Wake up from winterâ€™s glums;
Life is growing again,
From the old that's asleep,
From the mountains to glen,
All the flowers now reap.
You will be singing in tune,
With the wonders of time,
For the blossoms of June,
Fit like a song to a rime;
When all life comes in full,
With its growth and its skills,
No moment's longer dull,
There's just song in the hills.
I am happy,
You are happy,
It's the happiest time of the year;
It's so lovely,
Yes so lovely,
When life's growing everywhere.
Time renews all our wishes,
What grows old is born anew,
After some temporary glitches,
Again earth restores its debut.
