Go ahead and make me sad
It’s okay if it makes you happy
Rip my heart out and stomp on it
It’s okay if it makes you happy
Pour salt inside these wounds
I’ll lick them clean if it makes you happy
Corrode my heart like an ancient ruin
I’ll live there forever if it makes you happy
I don’t care if it makes you happy
I don’t care if it makes you happy
I don’t care about myself just as long
As you’re always happy
I’ll survive all of this
As long as I know you’re always happy
Whatever makes you happy!
Whatever makes you happy!
Burn the photographs; forget about me
I’ll forget about me too, if it makes you happy
I’m so sorry if I ever hurt you
Baby you’re the only thing that makes me happy
I miss the dimple upon your chin
I just miss, being happy
I’m sorry for anything I’ve done
And I’m sorry I can’t make you happy
I just wish I could make you happy
