Happy Birthday
Blow out the candles and make one wish
Since it's the day where you get your way
While everyone pampers you with gifts
I'll be sitting here and only left to think
if we were together maybe this birthday would mean so much to me as well........
Even though Im invisible to you
You dont know me to
You have your friends, the love for music by your side
Well, happy birthday stanger
For someone with a broken hearts
god knows how it feels
He doesnt even know how much I care,
how i cant stop but just stop and stare
its so hard.....so hard to just tell  him the truth
Happy birthday stranger
Happy birthday, my love
