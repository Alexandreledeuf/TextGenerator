Bring back my email,
Lordy, bring it back.
I never meant to send it,
I never meant to press
That press key and I never meant
To let him see
My wildest wish, sent hurtling
Through the ether like
A comet, trailing harmful fire,
Streaking like a rocket
Whizzing and shrieking and
Exploding in the air
For all to see,
For him to see,
And now he knows
And now he knows
And yes I wanted to,
He needed it,
He must have known,
His face blanched
Like the moon.
