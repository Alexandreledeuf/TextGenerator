Happy new year,
Happy new year to you,
Say you,
Wish you,
Bid you with the benediction,
But revel you not
In new year revelries
Just as revellers do
After being rowdy,
Taking to full,
Emptying wine bottles,
Consuming more and more wine,
Just as drunkards do
Dancing and enjoying
To end themselves.
