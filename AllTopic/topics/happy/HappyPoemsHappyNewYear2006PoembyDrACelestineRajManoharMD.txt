Born is A New Year!
Gone is an old year;
Let’s add new cheer,
Live without fear.
Greet your neighbors;
Greet some strangers;
Greet all your friends;
And make amends.
’Tis never late
To change one’s fate;
Problems abate:
Wait for that date.
Forget past woes;
Forget chaos;
With hope, of course:
Thus, our life goes.
Abide in God;
Await His nod;
Avoid His rod,
And thank the Lord.
When God's with us,
There is no curse;
Walk without fuss;
He sure will bless.
