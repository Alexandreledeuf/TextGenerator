into the unending work line comes a new beginning
of tolerance of adverse attitude, surfing the taste of
temper and luring smile
timing comes as it waits the gain that deals beyond,
human aspiration, the lasting praise gains no one.
but the soul that leads to the ground of sayonara in
the most astounding halos of goodbye
filled up the nice smile and return the forever respect
of the one who seat in the throne; the table and the
pen recite no one and see's the gratitude and the
work done even the night is gone
understand the boss, and jam what ever floats
in the air; knowing the good in the decision it gives
on your job the best goes flattered in the hand, the
whole things bless with fun
feel good, and save for a day, the fresh comes in
a wonderful awesome morning for you to stay, take
always the boss legacy, and chant the melody that
brings your pleasant moment with whom the
blessing comes in a spectacular happy day
the work is not yet over, always thank that the day
with your Boss will be a great moment to stay and
as you whisper a prayer, let this be the connecting
line of another life to spend with wisdom to live
stop, pose and confirm....... as you say Amen
