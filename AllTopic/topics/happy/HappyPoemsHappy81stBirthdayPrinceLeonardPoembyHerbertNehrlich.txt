Imagine, folks, he's barely up
and sits there with his coffee cup,
while reminiscing of the past
when time just flew, so very fast.
A sip of Java, then a nod,
it surely was the will of God,
this land where wheat has always grown
transformed,  a country of his own.
He had the guts, the fortitude
that saw some lawyers come unglued.
They said he had no valid reason
and that he was committing treason.
With musical formality
he built his principality.
It is well known that those who rule
attract corruption, like the fool
who speaks of better times to come.
For you it's water, he drinks rum.
Those 'servants' make for us decisions
while acting like all politicians,
we know that,  as they move their lips
they give us tons of clever fibs.
I say those people have a nerve,
they've got it wrong and make US  serve!
Well, I, for one, prefer to be
a common man, yet one who's free.
The world, as is, makes little sense
it lacks the word 'benevolence'.
And, if you think they are insane
you're right, they lost the word 'humane'.
Here, in a place called HRP
a Royal couple serves your tea.
So, when you make your travel plans,
the place where no shenanigans
or phony blokes pursue deception,
you'll get a personal reception.
Then stay a while, there, on the land
and shake the Royal couple's hand.
Look at the treasures, take it in,
the atmosphere, the smiles that win.
Today, throughout the world it rings,
the sound of bells for Queens and Kings.
Our voices, can you hear them call?
A Happy Birthday, from us all!
