When I walked you home that night
The vibe was absolutely right
The sparks were flying left and right
Jesus I was happy
We talked and talked of this and that
Nothing more than vapid chat
I don’t remember what was said
More than words were talking
On and on we went like that
Playing off and bouncing back
So rare a thing to feel like that
You made me happy
Starry eyed and laughing
As we said good night and parted
And I floated helium hearted homeward
God you made me happy
That night when I went to bed
I couldn’t sleep my buzzing head
Was wondering what would happen next
And guess what, I was happy
That was now a month ago
I’ve seen you come I’ve watched you go
I’m wondering what the future holds
And how to make you happy.
I’d shower you with lies and gifts
I’d move the earth if we could live
Together you and me like this
Great God I’m happy.
