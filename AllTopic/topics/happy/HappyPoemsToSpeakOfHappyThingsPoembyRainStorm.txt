I want to speak of happy things,
Like flying on love's wings,
Like sitting beneath the palm trees
As we talk about the birds and the bees.
I want to be happy again,
To remember things from way back when,
To speak excitedly of here and there
Knowing that I truly haven't been anywhere.
I don't want to worry,
I don't want to fret,
I want to be as care free
As I can possibly get.
But in this world I live,
Nothing seems to give,
Happiness is just a word,
And a life without fear
Is just plain absurd.
