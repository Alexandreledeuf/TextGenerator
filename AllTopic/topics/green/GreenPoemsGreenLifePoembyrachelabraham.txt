Now sitting outside,
The refreshing wind blows
Revealing the life of nature.
The grass may be yellow,
But underneath is a layer
Just waiting to grow.
The birds may be singing,
Dandelions may be glowing,
But will it last?
The birds may not be singing
The tunes that we hear,
It may be wails that they speak.
Begging for an answer,
In what they’ve done wrong.
Dandelions look like the sun,
But for them, they could be opening up
To whatever they have left.
Not wanting to be cut,
So when their second life approaches,
They will stay vibrate than grey
All because mankind got natures law wrong.
As I sit hear,
I listen to all that has been taught.
The trees are all dying,
The pond is overflowing,
From the dump we’ve been throwing
Between the beautiful silence
I feel the wind blow through my hair.
Then all you see is a plane from the city.
Polluting the air,
Just to get people somewhere.
Air is a limited thing,
No way can you buy it.
Replacing what once was,
Than keeping what’s there.
Experimenting a leaf, finding a bug
Scream, but only one thing,
The bug isn’t bigger than me.
Wanting so bad to kill it,
But killing that bug,
Is another phrase for extinction.
Life is a beautiful thing, but living in a
Dump is not.
Life may be short, some people may not
Care; saying no problem, we can get more
With the money we’ve been making.
Now, who in mankind, has the right mind,
To waste his money caring,
When he could be doubling it.
Remember one thing when life comes to an end,
What’s going to be left for the money of mankind?
The world currently may be black,
But let’s turn it green.
