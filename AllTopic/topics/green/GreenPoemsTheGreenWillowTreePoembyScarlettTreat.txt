When I die,
Oh, bury me, please,
'Neath the budding
Of Springtime's Weeping Willow Tree,
Near the creek
Where the icy waters flow,
And place in my hand
A single red rose.
A single red rose, my love,
Just an single red rose,
To stand for my sweetheart,
My only true love...
My only true love,
My dearest one,
the one I loved
Through all my long life,
And all my passing days.
And for the child I bore,
Put there those violets I love,
The ones that grow
In the moss along the creek
Where the icy waters flow
Around the roots
Of the green willow tree.
