Before the first ray of sunlight
on a frosty winter morn.
The frost has hazed the windows
to a feature of lands
long before our life began.
To the time when dragons ruled the world
with their hot breath and thunderous roars.
However, the gods were not happy
with their chosen rulers
and banished them away.
The crown they then handed to man
in hope for a better job done.
Since then man has ruined
everything his eyes gazed on.
Therefore, like the dragons of long ago,
the gods may decide in time
to banish man as well.
Returning this planet
to the lush green garden
that it used to be.
