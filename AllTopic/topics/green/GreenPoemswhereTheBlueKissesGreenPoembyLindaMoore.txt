Glancing off to the distance, horizons set for me
There is a point where vivid green meets the deep blue of Sea
Feet bare to touch the green, first one, then the other
To the Quite place, unencumbered by the clutter
Above the light warms, rays of golden sun
Anticipating silence, feet are free to run
Calming in the stillness, free of all thought
Relaxed and just listening, knowledge sought
Being part of Nature, absorbed into air
Weightless and fluid, Peace is declared
Where green meets the blue, iridescent in gold
Listening in quite, for Mystery to unfold
