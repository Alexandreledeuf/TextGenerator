I hate him,
As I hate Hell and all it’s devils.
I hate him for being better than me,
I hate him for being better than everyone I know,
And I hate him because he is with you.
Why you chose him,
I don’t know.
I have known you for years,
I have told you I love you for years,
I have done nothing but show you my love for years
But you choose him.
You are so beautiful,
And he is so ugly,
You are so elegant,
And he is so common,
You are so perfect,
And he is so flawed.
I will make you see,
That he isn’t good enough for you,
I will make you see,
That I am good for you,
I will make you see,
If I can’t have you,
No man can.
