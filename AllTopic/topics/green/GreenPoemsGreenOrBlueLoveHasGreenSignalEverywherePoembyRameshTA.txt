Love is blue, when lovers are in trouble ever;
Great love stories of the world are so and are
Called as Divine love for the world to know and
Appreciate what love can do to make humans noble!
The greatness of human is measured not by power
Or wealth or intellect, but ever only by love..!
That is why love is placed in the highest pedal
Of human world forever and ever to cherish by all!
When this is so, how can romance be criticized as
Immoral by law or religion anywhere in the world?
Romance is the source for love to bloom between
Two attractive souls both for joy and grief ever!
Religion, literature and law give clean chit to
Mature guy and girl to live in union by marriage
Once they join ever by love that has bloomed as
Natural flowers sans force or by any other means!
