Dreaming of the man with beautiful green eyes,
I dream of me sleeping in his arms where I lie,
His breath on my skin his body clenched with mine,
The taste of his kiss is sweeter than wine,
I look up at the man with beautiful green eyes,
Forever in his arms is where I shall lie,
My body underneath wrapped around his,
As I think to myself ‘it can’t get any better than this’,
He whispers of love so tenderly in my ears,
That I look up at him and forget all my fears,
Knowing this moment wasn’t made on a whim,
I feel beautiful and safe when I’m with him,
I’m safe and warm in his arms where I lie,
When I’m with the man, with beautiful green eyes.
