Grass is always green on the other side
But one has to know the other side, to see, weather how green the grass really is?
If you’re trapped then you can feel life in a shell
And not see how good life can be.
All those things that looks green and good to eyes
Just turn our own precious hearts go green.
Be content,
At least try to be…
Enjoy every thing…even waiting in a queue…
Life will soon be sunny! ! !
