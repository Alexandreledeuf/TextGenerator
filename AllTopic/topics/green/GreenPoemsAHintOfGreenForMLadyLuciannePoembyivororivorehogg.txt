Today I saw the first small signs
of Mother Natures Spring Designs.
Some tiny leaves of tender green
against the bare twigs to be seen.
The hedgerows will be clad anew.
Though it will take a week or two.
We will say goodbye to winters reign
and welcome back the spring again.
The sun grows stronger day by day
and blue replaces skies of grey.
My old bones will appreciate
the warmth although theyâ€™ll have to wait
A little longer for relief
I am quite sure it will be brief.
