Oh tiger green and sweetly blue
With honest eyes and very true,
How can we again meet
And each kindly treat,
When wise men say there is none you.
Oh bloom that comes again in spring
With green leaves that whisper and sing,
Fragrance so adorable
With colors splendid full,
Candid life to the world you bring.
Oh creature that man has killed
On your earth the blood has spilled,
And broken natures nest
For he thought he knew best,
With folly the forest he filled.
Oh tiger green and sweetly blue
You are now but a dream so true,
Of endangered species gone
That embrace of lead has done,
And soon others will follow you.
Oh Eden's garden's of concrete now
Like hearts of men are somehow,
Made out of chisel stones
Or yellow weathered bones,
A death comes with a blackish crow.
In days that are passed and away
I heard you roaring and play,
With beasts now all lost
Or returned to whited dust,
Like I will likewise do one day.
Oh creatures of this earth so wild
Why hasnâ€™t man treated you mild?
He's within a soul too
But not as innocent nor true,
As one, so of freedom defiled.
