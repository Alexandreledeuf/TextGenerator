Upon the swag of Stubbers Green
Where many ducks and wading birds
And all the geese and seagulls fly
To seek its comfort and the peace
And watch the day go by.
And while the graceful swans do pass
Upon the water flat and calm
Their downy cygnets all in tow
They seek the solace of the reeds
Which on the shoreline grow.
As light does shine and waters gleam
Now diamond ripples dancing free
I feel a whispered gentle breeze
That moves across the golden lake
And through the restless trees.
As on the grassy bank I stand
I gaze upon this tranquil scene
And lean against the tree to shade
My eyes from setting sun so bright
And watch the evening fade.
