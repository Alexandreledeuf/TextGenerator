So green the land that I can see
The hills and fields before my eyes,
Which blend with joyful harmony
Beneath the peaceful summer skies.
I breathe the morning air so sweet
So glad to be alive this day,
To see the new shoots of the wheat
And hedgerows now adorned with May.
Along the country lane I head
Not caring where it leads me to,
I know wherever I am led
I'll always find a pleasing view.
Beneath the bridge a river flows
Where ripples dance and brightly shine,
Like diamonds as the water glows
And winds unto this heart of mine.
The sweeping slopes of light and shade
Where clouds now cast their shade before,
With all the beauty there displayed
No man could ever ask for more.
So green the land that I can see
With gladdened soul I now do roam,
And as I go I say with glee
Fair England always be my home.
