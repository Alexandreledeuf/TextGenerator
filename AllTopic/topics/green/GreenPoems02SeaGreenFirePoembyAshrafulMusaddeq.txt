High-rise feelings walk in the morning
Southern tempest smells reminiscence
Mind opens the memory-card mutely
Audio-visual art exhibition opens gallery.
Colors march on the parade ground
Sky knows every cool happening
How zero hikes to the region of infinity
Disposable coffee-cup cries at night.
Love runs million kilometers daily
On the highway some nameless zero
Blooms like star within unknown infinity
Unseen sea-green fire set heart on love.
