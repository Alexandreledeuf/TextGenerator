goodness reasons to revel by reality
heart yet knows right path to heaven
eyes raves back by illusion of mirage
light refluxes into room of delusion
do we ever know depth of eyes by mystery?
as sands gleaned on shore delving blue
myth of blindness yet they still read
moment swirls by winds unfolding dreams
moon seems to be here on top of hill
whispers allays sorrow by voices
where is the time lost to living,
life when reasoned to grip of wine
as desire mills through green of wild.
