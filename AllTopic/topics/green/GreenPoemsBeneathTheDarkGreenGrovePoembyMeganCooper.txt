Lying within the soft waxy grass,
My eyes gently close.
I think of us beneath the trees,
Beneath the dark green grove.
Right here, right now’s where I want to be.
With your arms around me tight,
And the feel of the summer breeze,
And the coming of the humid night.
Not thinking of dreary autumn,
Or when you finally go.
Not thinking of the cold winter,
Or the white frozen snow.
Only thinking of this time with you,
And the perfect ness of this day.
Only thinking of you and your memorizing beauty,
But not when you go away.
I open my eyes and you’re almost real,
In this daydream of mine.
Of course your not really here,
Which makes me go back to the time.
I lay with you in the soft waxy grass,
While my eyelids gently close.
I think of us beneath the trees,
Beneath the dark green grove.
