Grace unequalled in my earthly eyes,
dream when snuffles into ocean blue,
dust inflames, as  fire stashes in the hide
across the mystery of the jingleâ€™s brim.
warmth cradles the glow of the green
voices when curves the shape of grin
heart revels by the words of whisper
night never refrained of gentle breath.
moments expense in gleams of light
scarlet rose shelters in room of repose
passion wades through reeks of lone void
the blue yet flecks into the plumes afloat....'
breeze flows trudging through the riffs
reeks may intone assailing the flow
yet the sultry dream serenades the cliff
as the wild stream brooks by the eternity.
