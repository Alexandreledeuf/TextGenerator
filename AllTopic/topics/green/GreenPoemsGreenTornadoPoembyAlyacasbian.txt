Green tornado fast asleep,
Just above your forest sweep,
High above the planes of gold,
Which drought and hunger will evolve.
Green tornado fast asleep,
Underneath the tigers creep,
Through the forest stalking prey,
While far away the dear do play.
For green tornado fast asleep,
You are mother natures keep,
With heart of gold and blood of fire,
The world is yours while men admire.
