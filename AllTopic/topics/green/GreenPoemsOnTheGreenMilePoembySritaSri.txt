Here comes the saturation point
I am on the green mile
I cant take anymore, for my knees are weak
I agree, i have lost the battle
happy though for the fight i gave
Its the battle of life, too early to lose
here i sit, by the window side
like the sea, the depths of my pain
Looking down at the burial ground
waiting, on the green mile.
