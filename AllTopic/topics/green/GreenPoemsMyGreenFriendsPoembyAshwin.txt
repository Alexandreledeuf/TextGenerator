I see her there all day all night
With just her fingers writing her story in the air
So elegent she stands - A
Sparkling green
With noone to worry none to care
Yet she gives with all her might
Shelter shade & a pleasant sight
I hold her by her hip
Are you ever tired - I say
A gentle leaf falls on my shoulder
As if to say - I was there for you
I will be forever I feel your love
Its enough to go on....
