It’s matter of fact that earth is going green,
From major corporations to the fluorescent household light bulb,
To the way of life that is to be seen,
After death going green is already in progress for funeral parlors in the UK,
And that is a hit,
- it’s the rage,
Cardboard coffins, clothes sewn from natural fibers, a burial plot in a natural setting.
Green funerals attempt to be eco-friendly at every stage.
It makes a terrific do-it-yourself project,
To have one built from designer cardboard,
-sewn paper bags I would reject,
On ones pocket book that should be breather,
'The trouble is, they are a bit ungainly to use, ' said Oakfield Wood burial ground director Oliver Peacock. 'They're not terribly easy to handle and if it's wet, they don't look their best either.'
Better than being forced to give up one’s life,
To be made into some kind of multi-biochemical compound,
To make the survivors at ease with their strife,
Your last moments so serene,
To Go Soylent Green.
