On green days or blue days
how easy it is to talk with you
to fill our ears with vocal sumptuousness
and our hearts with delicious laughter
sharing secrets only we can understand.
So easy to talk with you
no matter where the body is
the mind can be elsewhere
(we can pick up where we left off
or leave off where we can pick up) .
There is no beginning and no end.
Only, the comfortable...now.
