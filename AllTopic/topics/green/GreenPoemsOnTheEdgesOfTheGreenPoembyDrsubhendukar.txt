If  truth be  rhymed by the trust
on the edges of the green
you taught me the mathematics by abacus
I listen to your tunes by the innocence
Light when penetrates into the darkness
As  the world blooming in brilliance
And you lead me the way by your grace
As the green meadow flecks by the sun
Across the time of commitments
when owned by the intimacy
I simply followed you like a shadow
Even onto the last dregs of the night
Yet with all letters of resilience
I blink to the edges of the night abiding
yet frightened by the afflicted ember
faith seems to fledges when intoned
As your words whisper me of the rising sun
Even if grimaced by the winter chilled
Still light blazes the earth by the art of creation
When you stand by me by guiding agility
