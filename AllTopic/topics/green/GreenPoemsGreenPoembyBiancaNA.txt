Green is the colour of the mangroves at my holiday batch
Green is the feeling of happiness
Green is the colour of the tall oak trees
Green is the sound of crickets buzzing in the summer season
Green is the taste of pickles sliding down your throat
Green is the feeling of success and satisfaction
Green is a pray-mantis hopping around in the garden
Green is the feeling you get on a great holiday
Green is a colour that is safe and alive.
