1     Green groweth the holly,
2     So doth the ivy.
3     Though winter blasts blow never so high,
4     Green groweth the holly.
5     As the holly groweth green
6     And never changeth hue,
7     So I am, ever hath been,
8     Unto my lady true.
9     As the holly groweth green
10   With ivy all alone
11   When flowers cannot be seen
12   And greenwood leaves be gone,
13   Now unto my lady
14   Promise to her I make,
15   From all other only
16   To her I me betake.
17   Adieu, mine own lady,
18   Adieu, my special
19   Who hath my heart truly
20   Be sure, and ever shall.
