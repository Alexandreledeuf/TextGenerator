All that's in green
And between
Now yellow ways
That I have seen
Leaves of brown
In the town
And streets of gray
In winter's gown
Full of dappled dreams
And gloomy beams
Of its dark mood
In nocturnal seams
Echoing in the city
All its glisten tidy
Of the rimes intrude
Glowing so witty
Hard in its shell
And whitish soft spell
Of little silvery star
Mirroring well
Now is time for gold
Light of twinkling hold
For the times are
Gifts from paper unfold
