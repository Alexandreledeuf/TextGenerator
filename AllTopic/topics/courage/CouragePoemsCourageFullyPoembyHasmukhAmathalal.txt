Courage fully
How does only smile?
When you are troubled for a while
You are like any other man
No superman but only human'
You may keep happiness
And show it on face
But no one may notice
As you have your own voice
You may not love
And believe
In exposing woes
As life has many ways
It shows how to live
What to believe
And what to avoid
You can only add woes
So you have to make human efforts
With reports
To almighty daily
To encourage and grant courage fully
