they'll
fall away
one by one
as strands of you
milk the moments
you had
for what they were worth,
still smouldering
in the hand
even though
you knew
in your hearts mind
that
it was pretence
as they smiled
behind soft
contemptuous lips
that offer you
quiet resentment
instead of love
just because
you breathe
and are
uniquely you,
and that
makes them
uncomfortable
against their
square jawed
perfect,
materialistic plan
that can't afford
you
but can
their every whim
which makes them
sorely aware
of their
superlative selves
so they
push you away
thinking
you are less
then them
because
you don't fit
but you keep
steering steadfast
in the sanctity
of truth
inside of trust
as the most valuable
integer
and they fear
''your being''
because
through you
they see
themselves
impoverished,
and their superior
ways collapse
in blind belief
as they continue
to make spaces
''for time''
more than sharing
or listening
or caring
for anyone else
because
what they want
is never enough-
so let them fall away
to be left
as dust
when matter
does not matter
and when you are
feeling raw and
naked and
real
then you can
afford
the comfort
of being
with another
and that is
what is true
and right
and real
and what you
are all about.
