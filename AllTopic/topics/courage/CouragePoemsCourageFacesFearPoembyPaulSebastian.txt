Fear is imagined spirits
Fear cripples the bold
Fear maligns weak spirits
Fear kills the very soul
Fear breeds more fear
Fear breeds lies
Cowards are born by fear
Fear make dreams die
Courage overcomes fear
Fear accomplishes nothing
Faith stands in the face of fear
The brave make things happen!
