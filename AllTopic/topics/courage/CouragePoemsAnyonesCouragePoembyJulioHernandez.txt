Courage is something any one can achieve
It can happen so fast if you just believe
Believe in yourself and you'll be suprised
your more brave then you ever realized
Courage is something hidin inside
It makes you stronger than the highest tide
Courage means you can face your fears
That you're not afraid to shed some tears
In life without fear you can never be brave
You can't rescue a princess if there's no one to save
Life is a balance, like dark and light
There can be no wrong if there is no right
Getting courage isn't to hard to do
Look deep inside and you'll find it too
