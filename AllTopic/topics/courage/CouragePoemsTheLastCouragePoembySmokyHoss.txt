When old and gray
on a sleepful day
dozing at fire's side
near the finish of life's long ride,
will your soul once more awake
with a bitter remembrance of heart's break
to find the last thing tenderly true
is that little spark of love yet smoldering deep within you;
Stoop and stir the fire
those final embers of sweet desire
which are still aglow
burning on through the years of long ago,
with this concluding passion of a former time
you shall come to find
love is after all truly the bravest of the brave
the only one with enough courage to forever follow, even into
the grave.
