it takes courage to say life goes on
without knowing where you might end
it takes a lot of courage to achieve what
you want to be in life
it takes more courage to forgive
someone that hurt you
it takes more courage to make a tough decision
when you know you might end up  paying consequences
it take more than courage
to be responsible and honest
it takes more than what you call courage
to be a real man! !
