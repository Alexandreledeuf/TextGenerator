Courage is doing what is right,
Courage it takes to speak the,
truth
Courage it takes to be yourself
Corage to stand out
Courage to be me
Courage is love,
It brings hope
Courage gives you the strenght,
To all weakenesses
Courage is something any,
one can achieve
The heart of love is,
Courage
Don't close your eyes on the wolrd,
There are many wo cares for you,
Face your life and its trials with,
a quiet mind and courageous,
Smile
Courage is my last name
