Courage
Let our misfortune be a
runing water!
Our courage borrow
a lava from the wild
Volcano even though
some of our rivers are destined to flow
after we have gone.
We made life precious
we can also turn death
into diamonds, if only
we can let our soul be
a wind far from the eyes
of men.
