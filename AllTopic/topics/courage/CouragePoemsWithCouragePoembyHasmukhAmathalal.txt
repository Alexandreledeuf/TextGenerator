With courage
I don't know more
But adore
In heart
As fact of religion art
It is matter of faith
And shall remain in each count of breathe
With cruel joke of death
But where is remedy o sooth?
I bow down my head
And read
In recognition
Only one name for excitation
I feel happiness
On face
With so much of satisfaction
To have read about it in religion
I fear nothing
When remember something
The Kara stone fills me with courage
I live cheerfully with an age
