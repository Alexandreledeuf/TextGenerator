It is the courage of the human being
That made the world so beautiful to live with
Through his hard work and intelligence
Made wonderful achievements for human sake
The first set of courageous men's desires
Taught them how to hunter using the stones
They studied the necessity on events
And sharpening the stone articles used for hunting
Their strong courage and determination
Made them active to face the challenges
It is the courage of men in earlier eras
Invented the wind ridden ships and vessels
Through their courage and wisdom
Together with the determination and skills
They found new worlds and new people
They ascertained new avenues of gains
But for the invasions of fight in new places
The stiff competitions the real successors
Survived the fittest among them
It is through the courage adopted from footsteps
Of our bygone era of forefathers
That we learnt the qualities of courage
New inventions now continuing and ongoing
New planets are imminent to conquer
New places we aspire to be conquered
Where human beings will make their new homes
Provided water sources and breathing air is there
It is our courage and wisdom that follows
Through the intelligence and decisiveness
That we gain for a better future
Where the world will be better for tomorrow.
