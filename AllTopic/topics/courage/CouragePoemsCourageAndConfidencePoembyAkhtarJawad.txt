At about 0100 hours,
While I was sleeping,
My phone rang,
A naughty girl asked,
Is your refrigerator running?
I was not fully awaken,
I replied, let me check,
It's running, I said,
Please lock the doors,
Otherwise it will run away.
At this stage I was fully awaken,
I checked the number,
It was stranger to me,
Next day I tried to find out,
As to who was she,
But I failed.
During the night,
I called on that number,
At 1300 hours,
It was busy,
I tried a few more times,
It was busy every time.
Next day in the morning
At 1100 hours,
I dialed that number,
After continuous rings for a few minutes,
The girl attended the call and said,
Hell with Alexander Graham Bell,
You awoke me at the odd hours,
I remained awaken for the whole night,
And now you disturbed me,
Well, who are you?
The same man,
Whom you disturbed,
Yesterday, at 1300 hours,
The real odd hours!
I am sorry.
She disconnected the phone.
The same night,
At 1300 hours,
I received another call,
Budha ghar per hay?
(Is the old man at home?)
Yes but he doesn't want to talk to you,
Why?
He likes to talk with the girls,
Having beauty and charms.
Your complexion is dark,
You are fat like an elephant,
You are too ugly.
How dare you? I am beautiful.
Impossible, a beautiful girl,
Instead of talking on phones,
Talks face to face,
Because she possesses,
Courage and confidence,
That you don't have.
No more calls.
