Life is beautiful...
and ugly
Life is a gift....
we cruise and unleash our potentials...
waits...are the....scrap metals......or diamonds....
Passion is like rivers
water flowing endlessly
You can swim
but don't get drowned.....
Those who struggles gravely in early life
Would comes out a winner
In later life
Caught in the crossfire of.....
entangled past....
you deliberately diminish the agony and pain...
with dignity
A home is a home for the homeless
a great place to live
This whole big things........
living is an illusions..
it will vanished
when we're no longer here
Free flow of passionate ideas that calm a troubled heart....
charming thinking
Iâ€™ve the courage...
to write it so great
read...
before going to bed........
before dead..
make it a date....
not too late
