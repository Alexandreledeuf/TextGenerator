Courage is what makes us
Courage is what divides us
Courage is what drives us
Courage is what stops us
Courage creates news
Courage demands more
Courage creates blame
Courage brings shame
Courage shows in school
Courage determines the cool
Courage divides the weak
Courage pours out like a leak
Courage puts us on a knee
Courage makes us free
Courage makes us plea
Courage helps us flee
