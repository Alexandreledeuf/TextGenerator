Courage in a wheelchair
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
So wonderful this world is
So strange the life is
And so good God is
Her broad smile lights up the stage
Where she dances without legs
Not a story but a fact of one’s life’s page
People say this world is pitiful
But she says it beautiful
On her world frowns
But she takes it smiles of crown
Her hands are now legs
Her body she whirls, curves and shakes
With living music when plays
Looks like lilies in the dew
And daffodils at play
Rain, hail and snow
Will never turn aside
And my disability, she says
Through dance and smile
I can turn aside
Live a graceful life
And God’s judgement I abide
This is courage, very inspiring
Springing forth from great suffering
For after every sunset there’s a dawn fair
And I call it courage in a wheelchair…………..
