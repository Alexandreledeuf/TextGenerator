Most days I feel
Like I am
Losing so much time
Sitting
Waiting
Hoping
For you to change
Never knowing quite for sure
If it is me or you that must change
Always believed that by
Not moving
Making no decision
Is the same as making one
Wondering if it is due to my lack of strength
Or no courage
To take those hits
That will happen if I choose
To move
Now
Wish I knew if this was truly my choice
Or one made only by lack of my courage
