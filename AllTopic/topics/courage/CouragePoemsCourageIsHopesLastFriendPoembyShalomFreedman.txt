COURAGE IS HOPE'S LAST FRIEND
Courage is Hope's last  friend
Against all the fear and failing that we know
The inevitable declines and losses of Old Age-
Courage alone
Indifferent to odds and probabilities
Scorning terrible certainties
Can lift us from Doom and Depression
To carrying on for those we love
With dignity
Through the difficult end.
