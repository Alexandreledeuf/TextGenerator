Past memory
Make you feel sorry
For misdeeds
Or wrong feeds
It has deep impact
For acts
In mind
Forces to think as blind
It pinches
And reaches
To make you restless
With gloom on face
As rivers are now added with dirt
It has only bad odor to be smelt
Chemical waste adds woe
Where human beings can go?
Everything is polluted
Human values are diluted
Riots, unrest and murders are common
Not to speak of rapes on women
You cry in wilderness
No one hear even hiss
You curse but have no courage
Life shall move on with little courage
