Where do I get the courage?
Where do I get the courage to go on living again?
To come out of my shell?
To pray again?
To smile?
Where do I get the courage to sing again?
Or laugh?
Where do I get the courage to go out again?
To relax again?
To breathe?
Where do I get the courage to love again?
To be free again?
To cook again?
Or look at the blue sky again?
Where do I get the courage to write again?
To wipe out the bad memories?
And put the past behind?
Where do I get the courage to make new friends?
Or watch flowers grow in the garden?
Where do I get the courage to write a letter to you?
To save money again?
Or read books?
I find it
Day by day.
