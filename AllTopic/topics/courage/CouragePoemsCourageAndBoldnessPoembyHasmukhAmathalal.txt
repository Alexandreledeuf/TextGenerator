God has given courage and boldness
That must certainly be reflected on face
Women of today are by all means capable
Handle the situation and come out as successful
In any situation charm must be retained
Smile on face should never be deserted
If that is allowed then wolves may simply not pounce
Take away flash and enjoy their yield of an ounce
World as such is no safe heaven
For a lady and staying as single woman
People may try to take advantage
Try to inflict injury that may not be worth to mention on page
So it is nice to defend self and get prepared
So no one comes and simply dared
Someone has to take lead and show courage
Whole of the community then may show comeback on stage
Female today is not helpless animal
She has teeth to bite and stand for real trial
What else is needed in real time?
Bit courage, self confidence and presence of mind sometimes
