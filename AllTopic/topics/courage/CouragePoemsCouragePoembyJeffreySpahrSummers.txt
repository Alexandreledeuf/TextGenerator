It takes courage to admit defeat
to lay the weapons down
to declare oneself unarmed
before anyone else gets hurt
it takes courage to succumb
to ones fear to overcome it
to surrender to the frankness
of the unknown you know don't
want to be held prisoner exactly
perhaps someone will just kill me
then it won't really matter anymore
