baffled, where should i go?
used to be so strong.
used to know what's right from wrong.
gobbled the poison, fought my own premonitions.
how i stayed on track with my faith and my reasons.
The less traveled road is where I am on.
rough and narrow from dusk till dawn.
Stunned by an unforeseen path,
tempting beauty, an extremely fortuitous find..I'm distraught.
Bones shall rest in peace like a stone.
which one shall lead me to thy throne?
i hunger for an unfading glee,
suffocated by the air of melancholy.
