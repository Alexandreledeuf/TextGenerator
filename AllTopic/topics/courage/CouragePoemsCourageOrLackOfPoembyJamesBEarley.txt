.....This is an open statement in response to the recent PoemHunter postings by the anonymous 'Black Alex.'
As a person of color, I've known the ignominy, the humiliation, the vitriolic pain of racism, both in statement and deed.   My years have taught me acceptance, understanding the valued principle of free-speech. However, I do believe that writers..spewing venom..such as this...should dare exercise courage of his/her convictions, and leave  free-speech...unfettered.....by the cowardly cloak of.....anonymity!
