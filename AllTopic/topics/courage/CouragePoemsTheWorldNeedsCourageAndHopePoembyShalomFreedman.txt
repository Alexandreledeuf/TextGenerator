THE WORLD NEEDS COURAGE AND HOPE
The world needs Courage and Hope
It needs voices that believe-
It needs kindness and caring and love
But also the strength of conviction
The world needs so much
My own doubting and questioning voice lacks
What I have to give
Is not what Humanity most needs.
More questions, more self- obsessions
The endless example of the single individual
Striving to create what he may never be able to.
God of  Love of Goodness and of Kindness
I am afraid You need a lot stronger servants than I.
