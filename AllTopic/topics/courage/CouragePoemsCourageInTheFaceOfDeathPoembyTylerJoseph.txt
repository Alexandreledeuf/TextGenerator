She kneels, unable to move
As she watches the warm red pour from him
She fights back the tears
But she cannot stop the brewing brim
Eventually the floodgates open
And out rushes the blue
When his heart is finally empty
She thinks what she sees can't be true
She holds her head up high
Resolution in her eye
She leaves him to rest peacefully
In the pool of purple
