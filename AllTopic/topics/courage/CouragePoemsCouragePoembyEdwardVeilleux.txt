It's hard to translate one's feelings into speech,
It takes time to overcome the obstacles we meet.
Don't live life scared of what your words will bring,
Even if you fail, at least you attempted to do something.
In this life I would rather fail everyday,
And tell my stories of the one's that got away...
Then sit alone with my regrets always haunting me...
'I could have been, but I never had the courage to be.'
