What am I to do
when even eternally
I'm shivering from fright,
instead of from the wind?
Am I to draw close
to flames that shimmer
in crackling darkness
on a night like this?
Or shall I lean into you
while dreaming of the
summers days of the old-
times when I was self assured?
With sadness I walk
this plank through valleys,
though I have not yet expired.
I plead...is this my last mile?
For I do not wish to exit
this lonely passage way, while
feeling all I knew was survival.
Dear Courage...will you visit again?
