In the most painful situations of life,
at the moments of terrible rejection,
of being cheated mercilessly by loved ones,
even when I am physically abused
I promise to myself to keep calm
and to keep my spirits high
deep-rooted in my faith
that there is a God
who looks at me.
God loves me. It is my faith.
He guards me; God comforts me.
God is with me always,
and much more inmy terrible moments.
