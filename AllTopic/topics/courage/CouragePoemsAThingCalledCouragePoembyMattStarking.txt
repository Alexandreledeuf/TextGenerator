a thing called courage
it will only open a new page
if i did not cross the oceans
i would have been left alone
i would have been lost
and i wouldn't have seen
what lies beyond the oceans
the road to heaven
is paid with righteousness
for i was lost in the wildness
a thing called courage
that which unleashes you from the cage
the body is just a vehicle
transporting the soul
for there was nobody to love
nobody to console
nobody to talk to
wondering what to do
a thing called courage
it will only open a new page
