to still have the courage
to go on living
despite
all the odds of a life
that seems
to refuse life's
limited offers
of survival
to dream of you
and still keep on dreaming
of you
when reality
on the other hand
flatly tells
that you were gone
that in fact
you were gone
23 years ago
i wake up
only to  find out that
life is cruel
and insensitive
courage tells
to go on
living life
both as a duty
and a right
that life is beautiful
that  courage
is indefatigable
