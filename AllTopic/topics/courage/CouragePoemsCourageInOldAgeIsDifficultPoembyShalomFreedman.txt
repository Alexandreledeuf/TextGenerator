COURAGE IN OLD AGE IS DIFFICULT
Courage in old age is difficult
But Courage is always difficult
Hope in old age is also difficult
Happiness in old age is not so difficult at times
Courage in old age is what is most needed
Courage against the pain the illness the loss of friends and loved ones
The disabilities
Courage in old age to keep on going
To not lose oneself in depression
Courage to try and not become a burden
Courage to go on as if one were alright
When one knows one is really not
Courage in old age is difficult
But courage we all need
And must try to have.
