It was said that courage is the mastery of fear…
But not the total absence of it…
I was afraid to love,
I was afraid of pain.
I was afraid of big responsibilities,
I was afraid of having serious priorities…
I was totally afraid to fall for you.
But I need the guts; I need the courage because I do.
I need the courage to be brave,
To learn to face my life ahead…
The courage to learn to live with you…
And I know…
That the courage and the strength that I need would really comes from you!
