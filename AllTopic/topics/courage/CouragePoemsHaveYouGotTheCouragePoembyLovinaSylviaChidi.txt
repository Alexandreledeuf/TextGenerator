Have you got the courage?
To deal with personal baggage
Have you got the courage?
To embark on a new voyage
It is crystalline common knowledge
Many a woman born with courage
Has had piffling or no privileges
To travel through lifeâ€™s hideous passage
And stand stubbornly by her message
Highs but not the lows, If you one of those
Have you got the courage, to end your marriage?
Have you got the courage, to face your fears?
Or experiment with new ideas
Have you got the courage, to say you love me?
And maturely accept if I glee or flee
Have you got the courage, to repair all self inflicted damage
Before your life becomes wastage
Have you got the courage, to learn a new language?
Can you manage with new knowledge?
Have you got the courage, to admit your gruesome rage?
Instead of acting like an actress on stage
Courage comes with age
When priority is no more image
Courage comes with change
Evolving from leadership shortage
In life, at this stage
Courage is something you must engage
It must be clearly visible in every page
