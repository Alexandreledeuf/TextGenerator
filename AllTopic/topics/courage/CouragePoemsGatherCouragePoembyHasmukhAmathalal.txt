Gather courage
There is no another chance
Once missed means lost at once
Love is no commodity
So you go for exchange everyday
If you have done any mistake
That can't be retaken
Once you have hurt someone
That shall not be forgotten
At no stage you have shown regret
Or cause for bad fate
You might have gone too far
So is the result leading to fear?
Make no love bid again
Else it may add pain
She shall be troubled often
And life shall be turned into hell from heaven
Accept the fate
As it is still not late
You are responsible for mess
So gather courage to face
