Courage to stand out.
Courage to be me.
This courage I wish I had so drastically!
Courage to laugh.
The feeling to be free.
Oh I wish I wish I had this courage inside of me.
Courage to love.
Courage to trust.
To have this courage would be a plus.
Courage to accept I have courage.
This is proven to be;
The hardest courage their could be.
