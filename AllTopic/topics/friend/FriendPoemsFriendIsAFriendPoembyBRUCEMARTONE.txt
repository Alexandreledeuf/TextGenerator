A FRIEND IS A FRIEND
WELL BEYOND THE END
BECAUSE A FRIEND
LIVES IN THE HEART
AND IN THE SOUL
WHICH TURNS INTO
SWEET MEMORIES
WHEN YOU FALL APART
AND LOOSE CONTROL
A FRIEND IS A FRIEND
WELL BEYOND THE END
BECAUSE A FRIEND
SHARE A GOOD CHEERS
THROUGH SADNESS AND TEARS
LETTING YOU KNOW
THAT YOU HAVE A FRIEND HERE
A FRIEND IS A FRIEND
WELL BEYOND THE END
BECAUSE A FRIEND IS THERE
THROUGH  SORROW AND PAIN
LAUGHTER AND SMILES
BECAUSE AT ANYTIME
A FRIEND CAN BE THERE
