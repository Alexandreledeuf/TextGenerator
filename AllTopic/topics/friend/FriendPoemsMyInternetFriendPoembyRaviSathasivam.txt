Sitting front of my computer
and waiting for your mails
When ever I hear from you
my days are brighten
No body has ever spoke to me
the way you do
Even our friendship exists
through the net
Though I have not seen your face
I have not heard your voice
I don't know who you are
But I know what ever you say
that's comes from your heart
I have pictured you what I think of you
perhaps you too have done it
I thank you for considering me
your email friend
I am glad that I met you
Now you are my best internet friend
