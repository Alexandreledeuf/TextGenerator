He is such a friend I remember
He is lovely and cute light ray
I see him from far and feel sure
Pure light who guides my path.
I know he is very far from me
But I see him near as he dwells
Inside my heart in each beat
I see he writes love and sings.
He is friend of far a star light
He is super and powerful I love
I know he is ever true and eternal
He remains far and still holds me.
We shake hands of wisdom near him
He comes and we go with him home
Really very precious friend he is
I am and you are all fortunate dear.
