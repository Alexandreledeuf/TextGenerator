Children are like buds of flowers.
Nourish them with good thoughts,
Feed them on quality education,
And they would turn into a valley if flowers.
Their smile brings spring.
And their tears the monsoon.
They are the hope and future,
If they are allowed to bloom.
Very lucky we were
To have Nehru at the helm,
Who had vision for India
And a pure love for them.
He worked tirelessly
To bring cheer in their lives,
By quality health care
And made education a delight.
No wonder we the children
Remember him years on end
And we know on this Childrensâ€™ Day
Chacha Nehru was our best friend.
