I have a blind Friend
He's called Ronny
Ron's very Clever
We play Backgammon
Together, amongst
Other things
But I am Worried!
Every time I say Goodbye
I say: 'See ya Later', Ron
Some how I do not Think,
These are the 'right' words?
Maybe something Like,
I'll Smell you later or,
I'll Feel, Taste or Touch you Later
I should work on My
Communication Skills!
