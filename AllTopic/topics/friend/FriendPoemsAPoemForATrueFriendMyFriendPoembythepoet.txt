Time does pass us by so very fast,
Only a moment’s pause, dawn is dusk,
But the moments we had will surely last,
Till the day these bones are dust.
The stars above light the night sky,
Cheering the moon, joyful as can be,
I promise you, our friendship is no lie,
You are my true friend, a part of me.
Though these words can hardly describe,
How strong the bond of you and I,
Never shall I bow down to fate and chance,
That will change my heart for you.
So long as I can breathe the air around me,
I will cherish you, my friend, for eternity…
