How many noble schemes from goodwill's heart,
how many splendid plans and fine ideas
have foundered, lost their glorious craft and art
through hesitancy born of baseless fears?
We do not see the moment as divine,
thinking that those plans are somehow 'ours';
forgetting, too,  that Providence sublime
yields timeless good through time in human hours:
the task begun, this heavenly Providence
begins to move; bestows her love's support
with means, events, beyond coincidence;
assistance past all dreams of human thought -
be bold! and trust in Providence above:
she brings to earth God's magic; power; and love.
