The death of a friend
I try to be brave
But I can't stop the tears
When I visit His grave
Can He be replaced
I don't see how
He was my buddy
He was my pal
I am lonely at home
I am lonely at school
I miss my friend
He was so cool
I go to the park
I try to play ball
But is's not the same
Not at all
My minds a mess
My minds a haze
Lonely nights
And lonely days
I want my friend
I want Him back
The death of a friend
He's not coming back.
