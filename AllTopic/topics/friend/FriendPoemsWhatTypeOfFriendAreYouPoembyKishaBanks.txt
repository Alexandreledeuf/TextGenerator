SIMPLE VS. REAL
Let me identify...
Simple friends have never seen you cry. Real friends are on standby.
A Best friend make you feel better whenever you talk.
Simple friends hate when you call after a certain time, waking them up is such a crime.  Real friends don't care if it's during dinner or bed time.
A Best friend calls for no reason at all.
Simple friends talk with you about your problems.  Real friends are there until you solve them.
A Best friend mentions you in their daily prayers.
Simple friends speak of self-interest.  Real friends listen to your gab fest, never showing disinterest.
A Best friend never reveals your secrets.
Simple friends are 'ok' with your success.  Real friends are there through the process, making sure you don't digress.
A Best friend forces you to strive and achieve the best each day.
Let me classify...
You as my best friend, a God send.
