On poemhunter I've found a new friend,
Her comments she'll regularly send,
She's boosted my ego
Thus, helping my 'lines' flow
On her I know I can depend.
Her name's Mary Nagy you see,
She could not be nicer to me,
She's open and honest
And one of the bonniest
People.  I know you'll agree.
So I want to now, thank her, for sure,
I hope she won't think me a bore,
But she's such a great mate
To her I can relate,
So I send her best wishes galore.
From your 'adopted' Mom.
