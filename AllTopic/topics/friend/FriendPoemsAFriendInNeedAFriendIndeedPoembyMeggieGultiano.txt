What has friendship got to do in times of need?
A thousand reasons  perhaps for one to see
Someone in collaboration with unlikely times...,
Thus, I turn to the Great Provider for counsel
And wisdom for such trial,
For I too have also been there
Sometime, somewhere buddy!
I could not offer you fortune,
For I have none but perhaps
Some note to cheer you up
Like the earthworm burrowing in mud
To fit in some kind of home and feel 'comfy'...
Yes, that is you all the while,
Laughing our heartaches to no end
Until they got tired of you;
Such loving  care I find  in you, my friend-
A medicine to a searching soul for passion.
