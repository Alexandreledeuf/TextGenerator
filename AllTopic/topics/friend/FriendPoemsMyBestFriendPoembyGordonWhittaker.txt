He is my best friend
a pal on who I can depend.
We are always together,
I love him in a funny sort of way
but I hasten to add, I’m certainly not gay
He always gets all the attention
I’m sure he goes out with that intention.
Females fondle him quite unashamedly,
whilst I observe  with a tinge of envy.
But he is a real good looking guy
a guy that attracts admiring female glances
and oh boy he certainly gets his chances.
Yet from birth when he learned to walk
my best friend has never been able to talk.
He understands everything that I say,
he communicates with me in his own special way.
Tonight we are watching the TV
but I am bored, it’s a re-run on BBC.
I glance at the clock it’s quarter to nine
the weather outside is warm and fine
I say  ‘‘ lets  go to the pub
for a few  glasses of  ale.”
He jumps up makes for the door
wagging his tail.
Need I say more,  my best friend is
A handsome Labrador
