There is a miracle called in friendship
That miracle of friendship brought you
as my dearest friend
I have so many friends
but you are the only one impressed in my mind and heart
I know you are the most valuable gift for me
and it's my pleasure to have you as my dear friend
Your friendship is a precious gift to be cherished and natured
Your friendship is reflect on me who you are
There are so many friends come and go
but precious friend like you I can hold on it
You are like a star very far from me
but I know you are there for me
I can remember some one told me that
'Friends are born but not made'
Yes, we are born for each other
Let me be what I know best
my friend that's always known ' my best friend'.
