I am haplessly entrenched near a road,
Bogged down by the war's heavy load.
Then as I view the skirmish ahead,
My mind is overcome with a dread.
I can not envision what lies beyond,
That curve, that field, that placid pond.
Will I encounter bloodshed, captivity and tears,
Or will I overcome my deeply rooted fears?
Will I feel pain and anxiety within my frame,
Or charge with a vengeance leading to fame?
I grit my teeth, knit my brow and groan,
When suddenly I realize I was not alone.
There beside me was a fearless friend,
A friend on whom I can trust and depend,
To lead me into battle whatever betides,
I smile with confidence and then follow him - my guide.
