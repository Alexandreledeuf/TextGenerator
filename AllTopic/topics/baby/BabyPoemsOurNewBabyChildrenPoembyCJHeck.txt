We're gonna have a baby!
Daddy told me yesterday.
A baby brother or a sister,
Mommy's growing it each day.
It's right there in her tummy.
Can you see it?  It's right there.
I can hold my hand and feel it move
'cause Mommy doesn't care.
I wonder, does it like the things
that Mommy has to eat?
All those yucky vegetables?
All that hard to chew up meat?
I hope that it comes out of there
before I get too old...
Uh oh, Mommy's eating ice cream.
Will that make the baby cold?
