My mother gave me a baby doll,
And said it was my own to keep,
But something is wrong with this doll,
Because it ''baahs'' like a sheep,
I told my mother what it''s doing,
And she said not to worry,
Then I went back up to my room,
And my baby doll was furry,
I looked at it closely,
And what comes to my surprise,
The baby doll, is not a baby doll no more,
It''s a sheep with kitty eyes.
The next day my dad came home with a doll,
He said it is mine to keep,
Something was wrong with this doll,
It didnt look the same, As all the other dolls I see,
Because it''s cry was pretty lame,
And it had no clothes to wear,
But I put it underneath my bed,
and I still think it''s under there.
