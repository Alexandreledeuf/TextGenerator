As the nightingale sings its song
And the serpent slides into where it belongs
The fox after its feast gets up and yawns
The cuckoo croons and sings to the swans
I walk in the woods where the spring has awakened
The wild flowers blossom and threaten to apprehend
I ask myself, what did I do to have found you
What will I have to do to keep you, my dew
To have luck continue my way
You are my love, you are my jay
I dreamed of you and made you my reality
And then put an end to my duality
I love the sight of you
You have made my life anew
I live to see you laugh, to hold your hand
To see you sleep, to be your magic wand
You please me more everyday
Life has shown me a new way
O Wind, please continue to blow my way
Life without her will be dark and gray
She is like a vision to the blind
Solution to all riddles you will find
My love for her is as measureless as the sky
Will never let you go or I shall die
