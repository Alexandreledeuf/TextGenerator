Each day I listen to my heart
Mapping a path for our possible love start
My head speaks and so does my heart
Feelings of mine for you wish not to depart
With millions of gadgets
Spread across the planet
None of them can measure the way
My heart feels about you each day
Baby, Listen to my heart!
Will you be my sweetheart?
Baby, Listen to my heart!
Our heartbeats shouldn't be beating apart
Heart to heart
We can build us bridges of love
Heart to heart
We can sing our songs of love
Heart to heart
We can trust in this thing called love
Each day I listen to my heart
My heart has constantly infinitely spoken
Each time it beats for you a work of art
Only you can heal parts that are broken
Baby, Listen to my heart!
Will you be my sweetheart?
Listen to its instant drumming
Glisten to its constant humming
Baby, Listen to my heart!
Our heartbeats shouldn't be beating apart
