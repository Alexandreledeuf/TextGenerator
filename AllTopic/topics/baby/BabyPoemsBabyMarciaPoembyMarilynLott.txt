She was a precious little angel that
Came into their lives one wonderful day
Nothing could have made them happier
Or delighted that she came to stay
Beautiful sweet smile on her face
That came almost immediately
Their hearts were filled to the brim
Their lives changed so drastically
Her family all surrounded her
For much love and pride they felt
They couldn’t get enough of her
As in their arms this child they held
And as she grew and changed
Her personality was so unique
Her talent for drawing obvious
Their praise she loved to receive
And of course their love continues
Though she’s not Baby Marcia anymore
But their lives changed very quickly
When she came through their front door!
