When your heart is lost
I will be your world map
and take you to the top
When pain veils your vision
I will be your contact lens
with the utmost precision
When tears happen to flow
I will be your 3-ply tissues
and bring back your glow
When they hurt and let you down
I will be your psycho killer
and shoot them all without a sound
Happy Valentine's Baby!
