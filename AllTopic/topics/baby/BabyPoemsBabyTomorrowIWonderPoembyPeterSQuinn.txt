Baby tomorrow I wonder
Where my thoughts shall be
Oceans afar - asunder
Where doubtful questions flee
Try not to long too much
Feelings aside those play
Controls so out of touch
Into sallow fall's ray
Maybe tomorrow will give
What got lost right now?
And we could both live
Through this torment somehow
Yesterdays don’t come back
Only their memories
What each reality lack
An instant of actuality never sees
You are still steps missing
Where I'm reaching to
Though your lips I’ll be kissing
In my dreams untrue
What did drive us apart?
Was it the differences we are?
Lacking a beat from the start
Our inside feelings of war
Chorus
Maybe tomorrow will give
What got lost right now?
And we could both live
Through this torment somehow
Yesterdays don’t come back
Only their memories
What each reality lack
An instant of actuality never sees
Baby tomorrow I wonder
