We were driving along the bay
My girl friend really needed a pee
I said go over that way
Squat down behind that tree
Coming form a very good family
Baby had never done it before
But she needed to go so badly
She nearly did it on the car floor
As she came out for behind the big tree
And stood in the long grass looking free
My darling looked so beautiful
Still pulling her pants up after the pee
All refreshed and joyful
She ran to hold me
Darling seemed so grateful
And all she did was pee
