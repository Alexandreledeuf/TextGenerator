Fate is a baby young eyes
In to a morning daybreak
How in the truth you rise
Always yourself no fake
Give it your trying worth
Everything you have got
You came of this earth
What you are - what you are not
The days are ahead for free
Bring them to destiny
Be what you want to be
Most of it's had for free
Occupy dreams come true
Everywhere you go
You will be always you
Walking it to and fro
Something you can live
Is always worth its while
What you know to give
Each of your footstep's trial
Nothing is nothing still
So please give of your love
Others may find their hill
The dales have them plenty of
*Sorry about the Blue versus Young, - the word is Young, not Blue; and the fault is ours. The word got somehow scrambled through the cell phoneâ€¦
