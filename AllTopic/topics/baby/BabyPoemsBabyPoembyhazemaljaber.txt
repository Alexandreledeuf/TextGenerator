I asked you, if you liked me, you said no.
i asked you if i was pretty, you said no.
i asked if i was in your heart, u said no.
i asked if you would cry if i walked away, you said no.
so i walked away,
but......
you grabbed my arm and said...
i don't like you, i love you!
you are not pretty, you are beautiful!
you are not in my heart, you ARE my heart.! !
And i wouldn't cry if you walked away, i would die!
