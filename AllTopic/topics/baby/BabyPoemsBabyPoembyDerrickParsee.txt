Baby let me tell u how I feel
Baby let me love u till the end
Baby my heart is urs
Baby let me touch u all over
Baby can I kiss ur lips
Baby can I rub ur feet
Baby look me in my eyes and don't blink
Baby when the sun goes down will u be around
Baby let's walk the hall of love
Baby when I look at u I see another world in ur eyes
Baby I'm tha man that can take u where u need and want to go
Baby please let's go and don't say no
Baby this is my last cry
Baby make love to me till the end of time
Baby
