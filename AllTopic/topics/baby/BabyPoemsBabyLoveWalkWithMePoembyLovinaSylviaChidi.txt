Baby Love, walk with me
Hold my hand
Set me free
With a single red rose, under a tree
I love your big beautiful blue eyes
And the way you wriggle those thighs
In the middle of the night I endlessly fantasize
Kisses, touches, moans - my dream comprises
Baby Love, walk with me
Please!
Baby Love, talk to me
Please!
Every single elegant day
Your centre stage is on display
In my own loving Romeo play
They say dreams do come true
Will you appear suddenly out of the blue?
I love your long beautiful smile
Long and beautiful as the River Nile
Your mesmerizing face tells many a tale
With successful conquests I wish to hail
When is it time for us to set sail
Baby Love, walk with me
Please!
Rock me gently
Please!
I love your dazzling strong hands
Kisses, laughter, adventures - the whole brand
It is this love of you I softly demand
Your eyes speak, they understand
Walk with me
Please!
Baby Love, walk with me
Kiss my lips
As I close my eyes
Unlock my heart with your key
Set me free
With a single red rose, under a tree
