“I love you baby”
I whisper
As you leave for work.
“I love you too, darlin”
You reply.
“I love you baby”
I whisper
When we make love.
“I love you too, darlin”
You reply.
“I miss you, baby…”
I whisper
“…When you’re gone.”
“I miss you more, darlin”
You reply.
“I love you baby”
I whisper
Each night, and kiss your cheek
“And I love you, darlin”
You reply,
And kiss my face
Before I dream.
“I love you baby”
You whisper
In my dreams
“I love you too, darlin”
I reply
