Acts on me my baby
Don’t let yourself stand there
I am here for you
My mind is blank at the moment
I have close my eyes
I am here so you can act on me
Don’t let my imagination runs wild
I don’t have an energy left for that kind of exercise
Please my baby
Acts on me now
I am here for you
And I am waiting for you to act on me my baby.
