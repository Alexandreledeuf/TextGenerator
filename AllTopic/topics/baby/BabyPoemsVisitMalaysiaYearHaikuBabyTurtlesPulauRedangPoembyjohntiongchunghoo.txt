volanic eruption
baby turtles flocks
out of the sand
It is like an volcanic eruption when you view baby turtles coming out of the sand after they are hatched. Most of them by instinct would move out to sea. Despite the large number of turtles - at least a hundred of them -  from each mother turtle, very few actually live up to be adults as pollution and poaching kill many of them. The best place to view turtles now is in Pulau Redang, and its surrounding islands.
