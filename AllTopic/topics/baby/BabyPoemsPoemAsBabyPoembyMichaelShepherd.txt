They emerge; and as they do,
your whole world is re-shaped;
you’re stunned - as Adam must have been -
with the miracle of birth;
They come as miniature perfection –
who reads the small-print warning clause?
‘These goods come without a life-time guarantee…’
But you don’t pause to dream their own world for them –
except to count, in wonder, fingers, toes;
they come as answer to your whole life up to now;
right now, they laugh and cry as Love itself;
poems as babies in the heart and mind.
