A little baby girl screams out her silent cry
Knowing that her mother may chose for her to die
Abortion is a word she never wants to hear
As she gasps in her mother's womb so still and filled with fear.
A little baby girl screams out her silent cry
While thinking to herself and wondering why
How could her mother have chose this terrible choice
Does she not hear her baby crying with her tiny little voice?
'I tell her to be strong and not to let me go,
I love her so mush, and I just want her to know.
Why doesn't she listen to me? Doesn't she care?
It's my life too! What if I want to live, it's just not fair! '
A little baby girl screams out her silent cry
And much too soon among the angels she will fly
Her life is ending, even though it has truly not begun
Due to her mother's choice she will miss out on everything fun.
A little baby girl screams out her silent cry
Now only after a few weeks of life it's her time to die
Her life is slowly ending as her limbs are ripped apart
How could people get an abortion, don't they have a heart?
A little baby girl no longer screams out her silent cry
She now resides in heaven so high up in the sky
She sweetly smiles down at her mother and bows her head
As she sees her praying for forgiveness at the foot of her bed
