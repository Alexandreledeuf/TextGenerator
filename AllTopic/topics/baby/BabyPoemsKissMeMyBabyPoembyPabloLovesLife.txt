Come and lay beside me
and kiss me my Baby..
Kiss me like only you can
Softly brush my lips
with yours
Let me feel your warmth,
your femininity
Put your arms round me
and kiss me Baby
Let my body brush against yours
feeling your passion,
my body hearing your call
Kiss me, kiss me Baby
so that I can submit to you,
my body in rythym with yours
bound in this kiss.
Kiss me my Baby
so that I can know
that i'm alive
