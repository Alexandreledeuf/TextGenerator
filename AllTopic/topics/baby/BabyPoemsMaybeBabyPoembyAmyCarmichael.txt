Maybe I love someone, and maybe I don’t
Maybe il tell him so, and maybe I wont.
Maybe im heartbroken, and he doesn’t see
That I need to leave him if il ever be free.
Maybe he’s all I think about, all day long.
And maybe without him I just don’t belong
Maybe these words are lies, and im just a whore,
Maybe im love-struck and nothing more
Maybe im the pretty girl you see on tv,
Maybe im the stalker that you wont ever see
Maybe you love me too, and I should tell you
But you kissed me and I knew…
I'm your trophy.
