This is my First Baby
Even though I'm still young
My life is not really stopping
Even if I have done wrong.
There's a lot of things in life,
That I may not have seen or done.
Even though a child is being born,
My life must still go on.
My child will come first in my new life,
School, Education, to prepare for it a home,
Friends and relatives may want me to come and go,
Many times must I tell them I have to stay home.
I don't want to burden my parents
This responsibility is now my own
Even though I am still young
Just think, someday I will be grown.
It's not my mother or father's fault
As a child I knew right from wrong
I will love and cherish every moment
Because someday it will have a life of its own.
