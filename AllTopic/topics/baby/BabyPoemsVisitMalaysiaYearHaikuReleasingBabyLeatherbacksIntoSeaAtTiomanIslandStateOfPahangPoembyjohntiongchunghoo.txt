hatched turtles know instantly
the direction to head for
baby leatherbacks
the little big eyed all head
towards sea
baby leatherbacks
see you in 30 years
at this same beach
instinct instinct
incubated baby leatherbacks
but the sea is in their genes
humans make all the difference
giant sea turtle hurled out
for a land burial
l
Two days ago, I watched baby leatherbacks being released into sea. They all went on direction with a single will. None headed the other way. It made me realise that the sea must be in their genes. Baby turtles' eyes are large in comparison to their size. However on the same day, a dead giant green turtle was hurled out of the sea. It was decomposing, perhaps dead for three weeks. They buried it on Tioman Marine Park beach. Tioman Island is among the top 10 world's most beautiful islands.
