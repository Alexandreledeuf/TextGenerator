Quite child, do not scream
Now is the time to dream
Pony rides and Puppy dogs
Real big slides and Lincoln logs
Take and rest upon the sheet
And may all your dreams be sweet
Lollipops and golden hen
Robots and army men
So lay down upon the bed
While these tings dance in your head
Acrobats and kitty cats
Bumper cars and movie stars
All these things you do not know
Spaghetti Oâ€™s and play dough
You will someday
So sleep and grow
