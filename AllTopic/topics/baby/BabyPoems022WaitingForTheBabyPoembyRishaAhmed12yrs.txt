We are waiting for the baby
To smile its sweet smiles
We are waiting for the baby
To touch the nursery tiles
We are waiting for the baby
To say its first word
We are waiting for the baby
To taste its first curd
we are waiting for the baby
To eat its first snack
We are waiting for the baby
To give us all a smack!
