Pregnant again she confides in a friend.
No where to go, no one will take her in.
Walking the streets in the dark of night.
Hiding in alleys, trying to stay out of sight.
She’s hurting and frustrated with  pain,
anxiety hits over and over again.
What will become of this new born babe,
a decision certainly must  be made.
Crack, heroin, marijuana, cocaine,
what will happen to the poor baby’s brain.
She carries this baby while drinking beer,
no one stops her, nobody cares.
In the eight month baby comes early,
a cute baby boy with hair very curly.
Doctor’s stand by, but baby won’t cry.
He looks at Mom, please say goodbye.
