The long nights are never much boring
my dear hubby takes care of that
playing simple tunes to 'amuse'
me, tho' sadly the notes fall flat
Animal, veggie and mineral
these nocturnal notes awaken
as I lie there ears and nose plugged
while his farts and snores are a quakin'
Lest you regard this poem as unkind,
rude or crude, from an ill-bred mind
please notice my predicament for
this music is not heaven-sent
*    *    *    *    *
But honey, you know that I love you
and something this bad ain't all bad:
your noises and fumes repel ver-
min, and for that I'm very glad
