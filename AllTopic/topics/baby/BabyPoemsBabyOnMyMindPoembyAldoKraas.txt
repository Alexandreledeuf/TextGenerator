Baby on my mind
I can’t stop to think about you
It was hard for me to lose you
Half of me have died with you
But I know that you are free in heaven
Walking around
Being happy
Baby on my mind
I grieve the lose of you
Baby on my mind
In my dreams
I see you clear
You had blond hair and green eyes
You were a chubby baby
I hold you in my arms
In real life I will never see you
Or I will never know you
But I guess God was testing me for this
I’ve lost this battle this time
Baby on my mind
I hope I win the next battle
It is almost like being in a war
Lot’s of worries goes through my mind
Baby on my mind
I will provide you with every thing you need when you come
Baby on my mind
I want to be your mother
Forever
And be around to see you grow strong
Baby on my mind
I worried right now if you are going to be healthy?
I hope so
Baby on my mind
I don’t have the right to judge
Only God does
