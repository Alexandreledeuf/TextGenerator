Baby boy, you’re all I ever think about.
Your there, stuck in my head
I see you… I see you in my mind
And I feel you in my heart
Baby boy, I need you here by my side
Thinking about you just isn’t enough
I want you… Not only in my dreams
But in reality as well
Baby boy, Come to me
Make love to me
Stay here… with me
Baby boy, open up your heart to me
Tell me you feel for me,
The way I feel for you
Let me know that you love me, too
Baby boy…
I’m still waiting..
Waiting here for you…
