Ode to baby
In some small ways when you think about it
How much happiness he will give you when he arrives
But as we look around everything will change when he will be here
The baby will need my attention than
He will need me there to take care of him
And I will give him all my love
I will than hear just a whisper of what the heart of this baby needs to say
It will make a difference in some small ways
In that baby’s heart will lay the key
That unlocks his destiny
You will be a miracle baby
You will sleep tight my precious one
In that crib
Beautiful Baby
Every day
Will get better
Lullabies I will sing to you
And you will sleep tight every night
And when you come we will share that beautiful world together
That baby will live with the one he loves
And I hope one day when that baby is grown up we can be all proud of him
Of course we will be proud of his parents also
And I will be proud to be your uncle always
This baby’s spirit will always be alive
For now I just have to wait for you first to come to my world
And than to be a part of my life
Baby you are in my prayers
Every day
I believe that this baby will be my future
I will teach him well
I will teach him what is right and what is wrong
I will belong to you once you will arrive
