$5000.00 for every new baby born in America
They heard your promise and they will come in droves
With pregnant underbelly and ovens warm
They will come to collect their share of our wealth
The ignorant and unskilled
The poor and the down trodden
The uneducated migrant working masses
An invasion is inevitable
America is for sale
If we elect Hillary Clinton
