By day he was a plumber, a regular one of the boys,
But by night he ran Ladies Parties, selling fantasy sex-toys.
And when a plumbing he did go, the ladies liked his tools for sure
Which explains all his discount rates, when being paid behind the door.
One customer seemed quite nervous, when she got her boiler serviced
Unknown to him, amused herself, with rampant rabbits or anything else!
His bag that day was choc-a-block with wrenches for wenches and sex-party stock.
And as he worked, behind his back, she secretly rummaged in his sack.
His work was interrupted, while adjusting his tape measure,
From the room along the hall he heard her moans and screams of pleasure.
“I love this tartan dildo, and this kinky rubber mask! ”
He said, “I can sell you the mask, my dear. But not my thermos flask! ”
