He was such a tiny little man
Held in his mothers arms
Just starting life’s huge journey
Developing some early charms
The world so wide with wonder
So much there was to see
A family that gathered ‘round
Loving him so tremendously
The country was the perfect place
For the baby to discover and grow
Animals to tend and pet
And he learned to love them so
A sister and a brother too
Were amidst his world as well
He was close to his grand parents
More to catch him when he fell
Each and every experience
Added to his changing life
Eventually getting married
And adding some kids and wife
But looking back at pictures now
It’s hard to realize how strong
This man would become over time
Starting out as Baby John!
