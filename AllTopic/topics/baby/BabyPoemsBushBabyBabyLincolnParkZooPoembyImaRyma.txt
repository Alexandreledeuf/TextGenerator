A bush baby baby am I,
Bouncing 'neath the baobob tree.
Not sure I'm a gal or guy,
But Lincoln Park Zoo's home to me.
Mom and Dad are teaching me bunch,
How to super jump all about,
Snatching insects to have for lunch,
My night vision helping, no doubt.
I'm full of life - eat, sleep and play.
Good grooming is a fam'ly art.
I watch what the folks do and say,
Cuz both of them are just so smart.
At the Zoo, come visit. You must
Look for me till your eyes adjust.
