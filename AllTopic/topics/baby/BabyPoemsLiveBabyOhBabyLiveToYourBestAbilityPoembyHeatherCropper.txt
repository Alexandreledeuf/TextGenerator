life without regrets,
you only get one chance.
try your best,
it might be the last.
breathe without skipping a second,
laugh with all your heart.
life may be a nightmare,
take some action and change it.
change it into a dream,
the most magical one it can be.
stop for a second,
just to smell the roses.
jump on your bed,
look at the clouds.
dance like no one is watching,
sing and dance in the rain.
let your mascara run,
smile about your screwups.
dress to be different,
only to express yourself.
smile to make someone else smile,
laugh at a joke you heard yesterday.
draw a picture,
even if you're horrible.
sing out loud like an idiot,
help someone random.
cry when you laugh,
laugh when you're alone.
live like there's no tomorrow,
even when you feel like hopeless.
love someone without trying,
smile at everyone in sight.
take things slow,
remember everything.
walk in the rain,
kiss in the rain.
have a snowball fight,
with styrofoam.
buy a new cd,
of a band you never heard of.
try something new,
no matter how daring.
heartbreaks don't matter,
he never did care.
trust people you love,
love the trust that is given.
watch the clouds float by,
as if you had the time.
