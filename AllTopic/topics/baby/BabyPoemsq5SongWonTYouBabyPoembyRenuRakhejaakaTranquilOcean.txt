I was hoping to find you there
But you are gone
My heart is in tatters
Completely torn!
Be for real, wont you baby
Why dont you just talk to me
Lets sail out in our boat
Into the open, in the high sea
Was it just my imagination
Or was it just your cold?
You seemed so far away
What we felt, doesnt hold?
Be for real, wont you baby
Why dont you just talk to me
Lets sail out in our boat
Into the open, in the high sea
I miss the crinkling dimple
I miss the warm spark
You have gone missing
Loneliness hits me stark
Be for real, wont you baby
Wont you just talk to me
Lets  sail out in our boat
Into the open, in the high sea
