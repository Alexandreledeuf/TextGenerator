Beautiful little girl
That's what you are
With that cute little curl
Im glad we came this far
You were inside of me
I can't believe this is real
This was mean't to be
And i can't explain how i feel
I love your sweet smile
And that little face you make
It was all worth the while
Like when you awake
Now you are leaving
Leaving me all alone
I know i'll be greiving
But, we can talk on the phone
Beautiful little girl
That's what you are
With that cute little curl
Im glad we came this far
