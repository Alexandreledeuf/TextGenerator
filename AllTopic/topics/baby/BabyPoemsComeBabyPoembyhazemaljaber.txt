come baby...
come sweetheart...
let us change the classic way...
and break all rules...
come and don`t care about all..
ignore them...
don`t be shame...
there is no shameful with a feelings..
and let us feel the happiness...
the happiness which we created for...
come to give each other a love...
come to taste me as always you wished me..
come and let our bodies become as a one..
come and let me go so deep inside you..
come let us make a love..
