Everything has turned upside down,
but when ur around,
all my fears r gone,
I would wake up at 3 in the morning just to talk to u,
that’s how madly im in love with u,
ur what I love most about my day,
when ur gone my sky turns grey,
hoping that you’ll return to me in some way,
everyday I pray at night that ur gonna be mines for valentine,
I don’t know why but ur always on my mind,
as much as u push me way,
I will still be there by ur side,
I just want u to know how much I love u so,
if only u could see it through my eyes
baby u will find that
what I’ve told u
are not just a bunch of lies
baby u got to no the I love u so,
I need u near
need u close,
u make all the clouds go away on a grey day
baby u r what I need and want,
baby if only u could hear me say
baby please don’t leave,
baby I love u I need u,
ur what I live for,
if only u see through my eyes
then u will find that I haven’t done wrong,
all I did was love u strong,
baby u gotta hear me when I say
baby come back to me I don’t care in what way just come bac,
baby u just gotta no I need u so
