You listen
with twisting awkwardness
squirming in
my remembrances
of you
as I tell you
of you
at 2
And oh...the things that you
would do!
Oh you...
a tentative teenager now
embarrassed at
your recent past
which seems so far removed from you
but not for me
You trying to be
cool & sophisticated like
a Spice Girl
Girl power!
Years later you will have changed again
and deny you ever were:
'No…I never!'
but ah…yes you were!
You take
your grinning boyfriend
by the hand
imploring him:
“Don’t listen to my old man! ”
