Your the baby girl that brightened our world,
a suprise in a way,
and now that we have you here with us,
we're gonna make you stay.
You look so pretty in the dresses you wear,
and the tiny little bows,
clasped in your hair.
Its about time you came!
What took you so long?
You growing so big,
and getting so strong.
Im your favorite big cousin,
Duh! Why wouldnt I be?
I'll keep it a secret,
but eventually they'll see!
