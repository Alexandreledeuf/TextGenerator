Out come two tiny feet
Mum wails
The head follows to complete
Mums face pales
And baby newborn is born!
Tiny hands and tiny feet
Innocent look of sweet
A mild scent
Of sweet present
And baby newborn is born!
Is it a he?
Is it a she?
I knew mum and dad were on a mission
All the Os and As were mums screaming made-up television
'Spread wide open'
I often heard dads tone
A common nomination of repetition
With the bed singing a song of cracking bones
Did either of them ever have any inclination or vision
That of me they were producing another clone!
