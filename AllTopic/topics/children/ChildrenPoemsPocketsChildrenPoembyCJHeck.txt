I think of all the things I have,
I like my pockets best.
Pockets hold just everything
and they give your hands a rest.
I never know just what I'll find,
what special things I'll see
to put inside my pockets ~~
these are treasures, just for me.
When Mommy's doing laundry though,
she says sometimes it's scary
finding rocks and frogs and beetles
and my spiders that are hairy.
