I don't have a little brother.
I don't have a sister, too.
It's just me and Mom and Daddy
but there's lots of things to do.
Sometimes we go on picnics
and play ball until it's dark.
Sometimes we play on slides and swings
when we go to the park.
We can go and see a movie,
other days go to the beach
where I can get sand dollars
and Daddy helps when I can't reach.
I wish I had a brother.
I'd like a sister, too,
but it's me and Mom and Daddy
and there's lots of things to do.
