A long time ago, a little girl
believed that she could fly.
She saw the movie, 'Peter Pan'
and decided she would try.
She thought her happy thoughts,
let out a rooster's crow,
and as she shouted, 'I believe! '
she crashed to the floor below.
She woke up in a hospital.
Mom and dad were by the bed.
It took six stitches to sew up
where she had conked her head.
The little girl learned a lesson.
Be careful in what you believe -
some things will always be pretend.
The little girl?  Yeah, it was me.
