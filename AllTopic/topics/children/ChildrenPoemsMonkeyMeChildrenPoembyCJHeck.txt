Monkey see,
monkey do,
I used to want
to be one, too.
He doesn't have a bedtime.
Bet he doesn't eat green beans!
Monkeys get to play around
the whole day long, it seems.
He doesn't have to brush his teeth
or have to comb his hair.
If he had toys I'll bet his dad
wouldn't make him have to share.
Bet he doesn't 'scuse me'
after each and every sneeze.
And you won't hear him 'thank you'
after every single 'please'.
But Mommy said that monkeys
don't ever watch TV...
that's when I decided
I'd rather just stay me.
