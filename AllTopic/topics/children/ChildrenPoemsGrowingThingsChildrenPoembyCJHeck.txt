Daddy planted grass seeds
and up popped new green grass.
When mommy planted flower seeds,
pretty flowers came up fast.
I don’t understand it.
I planted my seeds too.
My spot has lots of sunshine.
I watered, but nothing grew.
I guess it’s something grownups know,
maybe kids just can’t plant seeds,
‘cause the bird seed that I planted
didn’t grow any birds for me.
