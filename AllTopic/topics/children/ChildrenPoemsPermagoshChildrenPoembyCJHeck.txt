Mommy's on the couch.
Daddy's in his chair.
I'm sitting in a corner on a stool...
they put me here
'cause I did something naughty
that I'm not supposed to do.
I invented Permagosh
mixing things with their shampoo.
First, a real long worm of toothpaste,
then then a cloud of shaving cream,
then two glugs of mouthwash
('cause I like the color, green) .
I stirred it in a mixing bowl.
Boy, it smelled real good!
It was even looking better
than I ever thought it would.
... could it be a cure for cancer?
... take the itch from skeeter bites?
... or maybe heal a sunburn
when it hurts to sleep at night?
Two shakes of baby powder
made it way too hard to stir,
so I added Mommy's perfume.
Permagosh smelled just like her!
Then the bowl tipped over...
Permagosh was on the floor,
and when I turned around,
Mom and Dad were by the door.
Now Mommy's on the couch.
Daddy's in his chair.
I'm sitting in a corner on a stool...
they put me here.
