There's a monster in my house!
It came in a great big box.
Mommy says it isn't so,
but something ate my socks.
I used to have a full sock drawer,
with red ones and some blue.
I even had some white ones,
'cause I wear white socks, too.
There's a monster in my house!
It came in a great big box
and I must make it angry
or it wouldn't eat my socks.
It lives around here, somewhere.
(whisper)    Shhhh!  I hope it's not around!
'Cause if you ever wake it up,
it makes such awful sounds.
Most times, it says, 'Yum-Yum! Yum-Yum! '
Sometimes, it just goes 'swish'.
But, I know it eats my socks up
without a spoon or dish.
Mom says they're underneath the bed
or spread around the floor.
(well the monster musta' burped 'em there
when she opened up the door) .
There's a monster in my house!
It came in a great big box!
Mom says it's just the washer...
but it's a monster that eats my socks!
