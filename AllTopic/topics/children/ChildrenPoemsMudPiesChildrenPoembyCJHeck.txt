Today I'm cookin' the dinner.
I stir in all the stuff that I should
'cause I know just how to make it
so EVERYthing I cook tastes good.
I'm smushin' meatloaf without any onions
and veggies without any beans.
See how I squished the smashed 'tatoes?
Right by the macaronis and cheese.
Next I will make ice cream salad.
(Cookin' dinner is really fun work) .
Here's shovels and buckets of jello
and marshmallow pies for dessert.
Uh oh... it's startin' to rain.
Now mom will bring me inside...
The rain sure is wreckin' my cookin'
but rain will make MORE mud outside!
