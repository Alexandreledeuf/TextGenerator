It comes in many flavors.
It comes in lots of smells.
It can keep a secret
and never, ever tell.
You'll know it when you hear it.
If you look, you'll see it, too.
It's everywhere around outside,
even there, inside of you.
It can turn a sad day happy.
It can turn a mad day glad.
It will even be there
when you've been really bad.
It's something in both day and night,
every second, every minute.
It's right there in your family
and everyone who's in it.
Did you guess my riddle?
Just a few things left to say -
If you want a lot of it,
then give it ALL away!
It's left and right.  It's all around.
It's under and above.
I think you've guessed the answer!
It's   L - O - V - E    love.
