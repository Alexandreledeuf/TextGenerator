Get your ice cold glass of lemonade!
Hurry, before it's gone.
We made it just this morning.
See the table that it's on?
We promise that you'll like it
and there's sugar in it, too -
not like it was the other day
when mom and dad said Ewww.
Get your ice cold glass of lemonade!
Boy grownups sure are funny -
they smile a lot at little kids
who are trying to make money.
Thank you, maam, and thank you, sir,
you've helped us out a bunch.
Sissy, let's go make some more.
It's almost time for lunch.
Get your ice cold glass of lemonade!
Only fifteen cents a glass!
We've got to make more money
and we've got to make it fast.
Daddy said it wouldn't work,
that people wouldn't stop.
They'd hurry right on past us
and then they'd laugh a lot.
One last glass of lemonade!
This was so much fun!
Let's get this table put away
and then we've got to run.
Sissy look!  It's snowing!
But that will be all right...
now we have money for presents
and Santa Claus comes tonight.
