Did you ever wonder about dreaming?
How the pictures get in your head?
Why they’re only there when you’re sleeping?
Why they’re only there in your bed?
You can fly anywhere that you want to.
You can soar above houses and cars.
You can even go higher than that, if you want,
way, way up to the moon and the stars.
You can be someone great, someone special
who has magical powers to use
to save your brother from monsters -
or NOT save, if that’s what you choose.
Dreaming is different from movies.
You don’t get dressed up and go out.
And a dream can be different every night -
you make up what the dream is about.
It’s too bad dreaming's for bedtime,
but I guess that’s just how it must be.
If we walked around dreaming in daylight,
why would we ever need sleep?
