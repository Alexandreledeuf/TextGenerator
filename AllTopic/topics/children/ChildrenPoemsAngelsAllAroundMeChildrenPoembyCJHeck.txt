Angels all around me.
Angels high above.
Pretty angels everywhere
guarding me with love.
Angels at my bedside
help me start my prayers
while other angels hurry
mom and daddy up the stairs.
When it’s time to say night-night
the angels’ jobs aren’t through.
When I close my eyes to sleep,
they watch me all night, too.
Angels all around me.
Angels high above.
Pretty angels everywhere
guarding me with love.
