I love jelly beans,
all but the black ones, they’re yucky.
Red ones trade best.
Orange is good.
Green tastes even better!
(all but the black ones, they’re yucky) .
White is like vanilla.
Sissy likes the white.
Purples bite, but I still like,
all but the black ones, they’re yucky.
I like pink, but it’s for girls.
Yellow is my favorite.
