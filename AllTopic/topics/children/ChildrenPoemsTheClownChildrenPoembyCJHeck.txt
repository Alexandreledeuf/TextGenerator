The day the circus came to town,
my favorite was the circus clown
with his great big shoes
and funny clothes,
a painted face,
and a big red nose.
A giant smile was painted there,
with children laughing, everywhere.
I wondered as I
looked at him,
was he frowning 'neath
his painted grin?
Now when I am feeling down,
I think about that circus clown
with his great big shoes
and funny clothes,
a painted face,
and big red nose.
I put a smile on, anyway
and soon, my frown just fades away
like the day the circus
came to town
and I learned it watching
the circus clown.
