Dear Mommy up in heaven,
you’re always in my mind.
I wish that you could tell me
why you left so much behind.
You left your bunny slippers,
fuzzy pink with big long ears,
and when Daddy holds your picture
he’s sad and cries real tears.
Your clothes are in the bedroom,
you left your perfume, too,
and when I need you close to me
I go there - it smells like you.
You must hum a lot in heaven.
Daddy says he thinks you might.
Sometimes I think I hear you
when I shut my eyes real tight.
I miss your hugs and kisses,
you took most of them with you,
but I’m glad you made me save some
in my jammy pockets, too.
Me and Daddy miss and love you
and we don’t mean to make a fuss.
I guess you loved us both so much
that you left your stuff for us.
