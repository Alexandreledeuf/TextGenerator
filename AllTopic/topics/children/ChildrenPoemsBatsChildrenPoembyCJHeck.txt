Bats can hit a baseball.
Girls can bat their eyes.
But the bats I want to talk about
fly with radar in the skies.
Bats are cute and furry.
I think bats are cool
and if I could only catch one
I’d bring it into school.
I’m sure you think they’re creepy.
They might even make you scream.
But where would we be without a bat
on scary Halloween?
I know it’s hard to like them.
It isn’t automatic.
Mom and dad don’t mind them though
IF... they don’t live in our attic.
