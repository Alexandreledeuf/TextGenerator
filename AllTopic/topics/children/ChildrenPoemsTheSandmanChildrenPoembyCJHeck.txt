Daddy said to Mom and me,
'Good night, I'm going to bed.
I'm sleepy and the Sandman
has been dancing on my head.'
(I don't think I like this Sandman.
Why'd he do that to my dad?)
and then I asked my mommy,
'Is the Sandman someone bad? '
Mom smiled and said, 'Don't worry.
The Sandman's just pretend.'
...but I'll sleep with one eye open
just in case he comes again.
