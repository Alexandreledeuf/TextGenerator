The toothfairy took my tooth lath night
and left thome money, too.
But now I can't thay wordth too well
and I don't know what I'll do.
What if my friendth all laugh at me
becauth I thpeak like thith?
What if they won't come over
and thereth no one to play with?
Hey gueth what?  My friend juth called.
He lotht hith tooth today!
You know what elth?  He thoundth like me
and he wanth to come and play!
