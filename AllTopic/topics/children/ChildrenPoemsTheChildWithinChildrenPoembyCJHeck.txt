Down inside this grownup
lives the child that used to be.
When I look in my mirror,
she stares right back at me.
Now that I’m a grownup,
it’s an older face I see,
but the child’s still there, just hiding,
way down deep inside of me.
Sometimes we work together,
that little girl and me.
She comes up from her hiding place
and we write poetry.
I like being grownup
and I wouldn’t wanna swap.
Well... maybe a little younger face
with no grey hair on top.
