I like saying, spring has sprung.
I like the way it sounds.
And spring brings with it lots of rain,
(God's wringing out his clouds) .
Yay, rain means puddle stompin'!
After rain, they're everywhere.
No shoes or socks, I'm barefoot!
I get wet, but I don't care.
I don't think Mommy likes it
'cause I get muddy (ewwww) ,
but puddles just can't help it,
somehow mud gets in there, too.
Uh oh... here comes Mommy.
Hey, look at Mommy run!
Mommy's puddle stompin', too?
Now it's REALLY fun!
