There once was a monkey named Mike
who headed out west on his bike.
He soon was stopped cold
with no token for toll
and the tollkeeper said, “Take a hike.”
But the monkey named Mike didn’t hike
and took a new route with his bike.
When one tire went flat,
a mechanic saw that
and told Mike his bike found a spike.
The mechanic then fixed the bike
and said to the monkey named Mike,
“Hey, Mike, you should FLY
and never again try
to ride your bike, Mike.  See the spike? ”
