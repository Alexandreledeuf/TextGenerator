My daddy calls me Will-dog.
PaPa calls me chief.
I’m always baby brother
to my sister - oh, good grief!
My Nana calls me punkin’.
Mama calls me little man.
I’m boo-boo bear to Grammy,
geez, I wonder WHO I am.
The mailman says, “Hey, sport! ”
Auntie calls me precious lamb
and when I act real silly,
MiMi says I’m quite a ham.
I guess it’s like my sneakers.
Some call them tennis shoes.
Both names mean the same thing.
It doesn’t matter which I use.
Or maybe like a puppy dog,
some people call them hounds.
It doesn’t really matter,
‘cause they both make barking sounds.
Maybe it’s not so awful
they don’t all call me the same.
I feel kinda-sorta special
that I have so many names!
