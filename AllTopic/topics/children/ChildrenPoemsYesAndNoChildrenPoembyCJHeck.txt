I like words like 'yes' and 'no'
they mean just what they say.
They either mean you can or can't
do what you want today.
Other words like 'maybe'
or even like 'we'll see'
make me feel like crying
'cause that isn't answering me.
'Someday' isn't too bad
'cause it still means we will...
but 'later' is even better
'cause it's waiting just until.
