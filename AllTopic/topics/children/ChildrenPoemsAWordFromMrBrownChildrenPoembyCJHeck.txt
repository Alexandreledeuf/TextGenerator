Our neighbor, Mr. Brown,
came over yesterday.
He was yelling at my daddy
about the pothole in our lane.
'Surely the city should fix it!
Surely they know it's there.
It's the widest, deepest pothole!
Surely the city must care! '
I know Mr. Brown was angry,
and he's really a very nice man,
but why'd he call Daddy Shirley?
Some things I don't understand...
