I’m just going to sit here.
I won’t say a word.
I’ll be like the children
who are seen and not heard.
If I talk I’ll say something
I know I’ll regret,
‘cause I’m so mad at Sissy,
I may never forget.
She broke all my crayons,
then she threw them away,
and she blamed me for spilling
her milk yesterday.
I keep thinking about
what I learned when just small:
either say something nice,
or say nothing at all.
If I say what I want to say,
I might be heard,
so I’m just going to sit here
and not say a word.
