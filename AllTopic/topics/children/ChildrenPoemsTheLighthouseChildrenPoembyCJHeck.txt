There's a lighthouse on an island
built on boulders in the sea.
A home to no one anymore,
and it's beautiful to me.
The waves come crashing, sending spray.
their salty drops rain down
blessing me and other people
and the buildings in the town.
The lighthouse wakes at evening time
and its beacon comes around
protecting all the ships out there
so they don't run aground.
I sit and send my wishes
way up high on seagull wings
and then pretend that they'll come true
on notes the lighthouse sings.
That lighthouse must be magic.
I hear it call to me
from its bed of boulders
on an island in the sea.
