Being glad is simple
and sometimes glad is great.
Sometimes glad is liking
almost everything on my plate.
I feel that way with birthdays.
Birthdays make me glad.
I like writing “I love you”
in cards for Mom and Dad.
But sometimes glad is hard to find,
like when angry came last week.
Glad was no where, pushed away,
and sad ran down my cheek.
Angry didn’t stay too long,
that’s good cause it felt bad...
when it was gone, then it made room
to put back my friend, glad!
