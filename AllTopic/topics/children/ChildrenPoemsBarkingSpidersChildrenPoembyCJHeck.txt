The barking spiders all march in
just past dinner time.
Some big, some small, they come to call
floating on the wind behind.
Each is clearly noticed,
although they can't be seen.
You're positive they're there, though,
'cause your nose is very keen.
You know you can't outrun them
and a net won't get them caught.
Your friends laugh 'cause they're funny,
but your mom yells 'cause they're not.
So open all the windows!
Crack the vents, real fast!
'Cause these aren't normal spiders -
BARKING spiders are just gas.
