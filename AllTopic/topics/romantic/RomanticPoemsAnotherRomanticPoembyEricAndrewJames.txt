The whole world is just
One romantic dramatic comedy
Horror after another
Each person
That hopeless romantic
Triumphant lowlife, scoundrel,
Angel, model
That we see every day
Every kiss is love
Every loss the worst
Things start to loose their meanings
In this same old romance
Comediatric dramatic horror series
With way to many seasons
Once a hit
Now watched
Out of pity
Waiting for another character
To get killed off
So they can return
To their own romantic
Comedy drama horror life cliché
Hoping one day
The movies won’t be able to say enough
To call it a romantic
Comedy horror drama
Of a life
