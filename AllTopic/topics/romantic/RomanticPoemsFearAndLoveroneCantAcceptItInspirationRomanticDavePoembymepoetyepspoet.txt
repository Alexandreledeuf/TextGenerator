Good imagery in SILENCE
SILENTLY! ! ! ! ! ! !
but
this is one is like a Swan dance
compose accordingly
and
please reply all those who comment
else one day you will lament
time is wasted
all is spent...
I'd rather kiss her lips
when I'm kickingalive
who knows who
where in heaven
we will ever meet
Love if at all lies here
Dav
be more pragmatic next time
when you to meet
lie as in lay
just don't lie
kiss her eyes
and
kiss your own nose
as you plant yourself
against a mirror
when all alone
dews/drops.... fall
as a guy you know
..LOVE IS THE ONLY ONE WORD
FOR ALL WHICHHANKER
Life is just an accident
born out of love
and blessed are those who become the outcome
of such a rendition
and a fresh life is born
but in another form
we reincarnate
if at all to be another one
in love to be born again and again
but in different form
come love me
O poet
if you want tojust for once
come in the torrential rain
and with me drench
remove all your attire
we are divine aren't we...
they need no clothes
why not we like them be
the UNIVERSE is vast
none can all see
just ADMIRE THE POET
in poet me
all love and poetry
is IMAGERY! ! !
May appear sexy to ye
may be
