Poetess is very happy today and in romantic mood
For her love is the only passion and food
She has Chris on hand to go with
Full with deep love and armed with teeth
What moon, earth or for that matter anything
She has needed none or expects something
Since weeks she had prepared beautiful ground
Now naturally she will be drunk and found
All her eagerness may come to an end
In Chris she has found an ally and friend
What else she has needed to enjoy?
No stars, no sky and no moon to joy
Let her explain what happened on that day
How did she enjoyed it till long night stay
What did he get in return for complete surrender?
Who was winner in race? Female or male gender
Let it remain there as their private domain
They might have talked about loneliness and pain
We may hear the version form poetess's encounter
let her take complete world by storm and enter
