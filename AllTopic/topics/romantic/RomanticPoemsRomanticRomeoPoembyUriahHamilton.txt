Melancholy heart wavers
Like a sinking ship
From inward disappointment
Of life plans crumbling
On the unsavory streets
Of urban despair.
I dream of brushing
A beautiful woman’s hair
With the lavish possibilities
Of a millionaire,
But I daily catch curbside coins
Instead of the shimmering diamonds
I desire to place around her throat.
I’m never agitated for long,
Even though I have the empty stare
Of a preoccupied professor
At an archeological dig.
You would find me a sweet lover
In my little shack and poetry bed
Of hopeless resignation.
I know my insignificant place,
But I remain a romantic Romeo nonetheless.
