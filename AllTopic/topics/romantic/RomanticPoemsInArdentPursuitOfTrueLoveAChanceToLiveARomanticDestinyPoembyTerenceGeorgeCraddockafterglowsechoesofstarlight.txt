we could and should write a book about elite family photo fashion albums
it is worth a review those with a gypsy spirit will flush rules down the loo
pursue wealth at cost of love calculated cold reap loss live to heartfelt rue
lost chances for love a stone cold marriage bed ice cold lover emotionless;
is it not worth all to ardent pursue a great true love a chance for a destiny
wealth is like the leaves on the tree that wither and fall in aged Autumn
true love is the whole tree every tree in passion forest ever Spring reborn
money sterile is like ice rain drops falling from black cloud heights stormy;
true love is the sea entire oceans where each sacred raindrop was birth born
lust is like a dew drop sparkling on a blade of grass at newborn day dawn
summer heat evaporates each elfin droplet as long heartless burns hot sun;
tempting rainbow possessions parched long drought fade empty gather dust
true love lost is ever a broken wasteland poor worthless soil destitute dust
devoid of life's magic in strife woven hectic pace life lust stains a red rust;
