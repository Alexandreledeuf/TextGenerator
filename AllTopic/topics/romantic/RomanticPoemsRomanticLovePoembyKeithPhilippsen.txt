Romance is a must for most young hearts
Gestures of love broken in tiny parts
A dozen roses, a chocolate heart,
Writing a poem with all your heart,
A cute little card with x’s and o’s
Sittin’ by the fire warming your toes
A candle lit dinner down by the beach
You both come in a pair not in a peach
Long conversations late into the night
Love is there and romance is in sight
Just a bear hug for you just like this
Romance is even just the right kiss…
