Little romantic
I am hasmukh* by name
And can claim
Full laughing stock
With jokes
"Has" means to smile
"Mukh" means face
It means smiling face
No sadness in any case
People may often comment
You have right meaning in it
But I know what hidden truth
I feel it with each count of breathe
I have moved
And proved
At each turn
That I still learn
I have yet to feel
Pain and fill
Their life with charm and happiness
I want same smile on their face
I am having little romantic nature
And I see in it a good future
I come across many friends
With their leaning attitude in the end
