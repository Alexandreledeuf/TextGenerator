After I
Ruminate,
Debate,
Meditate,
Speculate,
Map it out,
List the pros and cons,
Consult my astrology chart,
Address the uncertainties,
Assess the risks,
Analyze past mistakes,
Evaluate the odds,
Examine his motives,
And simply surrender…
I’ve been known to be
Just as big a fool
As the next person,
In the name of love
