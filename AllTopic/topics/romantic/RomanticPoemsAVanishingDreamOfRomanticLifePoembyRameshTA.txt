Hostel farewell party on the last day of college
All felt much for departing once and for all sure
Moving to different places to embark on working life
Quit serious from college life romantically enjoyed!
Nostalgia of college life comes to life whenever the
Photos of friends and picnic tours enjoyed are again
Reviewed in loneliness and ends in never to be again
Revived so in the present life quite different ever.!
Thoughts of friends come, but thoughts on present
Crisis and family situation take a lion's share of time
In such a way that those thoughts of friends disappear
Into thin air putting one in the deep mire of tasks!
Days of joyful life spent romantically in the past are
Just as dreams vanish, when we wake from deep sleep ever!
