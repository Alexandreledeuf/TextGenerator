A pre marriage courtship is a lovely adventure,
Being attracted to beauty, playing hides and seeks,
Waiting for hours on the road opposite to a bedroom,
On the first floor just to have a glimpse of a teen aged girl,
Chasing that girl on a bicycle up to a girls college,
Where one could not get in and waiting for her,
Outside the college till the bells announced,
She’s about to come out and then chasing once again,
Until she got in the gates of her lovely home!
Regretted holidays for missing the routine!
What is it, foolishness or an adventure?
Is it merely a call of nature?
It might be foolishness but when responded,
By the eyes of a sweet and lovely nice girl,
An element enters in this wild foolishness,
An element that softens the stones of hearts,
And the adventure when blended by love,
What else it is, other than romance,
What a life is that without a romance!
A duty imposed for just to reproduce!
Stealing a moment to meet somewhere outside,
Be a windy evening of a hot summer noon,
Or a sunny noon of a cold foggy morning,
A moonlit night on the bank of a river,
In the pleasant rains with roses and jasmines,
To be wet in love and to come back in senses,
Before t’s too much with the dreams of future,
Gripping and controlling the call of nature,
Without all that the life remains incomplete,
Sweet memories we need in the icy old age!
Bitter realities of life when kill the adventure,
Adventure goes in coma but love never dies,
Understanding each other, accepting each other,
With the weaknesses exposed after marriage,
Changes the nature of love completely,
Compromises are made, sacrifices are made,
When a wife takes care of his childish husband,
She behaves like a stern but loving grandmother,
But the child is not annoyed at all,
He enjoys a carefree lovely nice life,
Ignoring a few painful casual strife,
Three cheers for a beautiful lovely nice wife!
