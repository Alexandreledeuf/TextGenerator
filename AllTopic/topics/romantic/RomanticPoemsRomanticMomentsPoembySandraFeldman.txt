The most exciting moments,
The ones the heart loves best,
Those deep romantic moments,
You wish would never end,
The ones you will remember,
The ones you can't forget,
Those great romantic moments,
Life's most wanted success.
The most romantic moments,
Are those you can't forget,
When Life was a good omen,
When Life had reached its crest,
Those most enchanting moments,
When all your life is blessed,
And finally, Beloved,
The search is put to rest,
As hands softly entangle,
And lips become caress.
