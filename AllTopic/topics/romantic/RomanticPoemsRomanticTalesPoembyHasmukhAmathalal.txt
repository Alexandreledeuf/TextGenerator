I love writing
With emotional fighting
To add something unusual
But still look it as casual
I make life to look wonderful
I wish everybody to become successful
Peacefully live with their expectations
With harmonious coexistence and relations
We are not here to score points
Take lives of others with joint conspiracy
It spoils the chance for living together
The message is spread with split offers
What do I try to write?
I still have nerves to excite
Write for readers to know some of the unknown aspects
That may sometimes urge them to act
Romantic tales are not my style
To work more in this direction is not goal
To remain in touch with human thinking
That is all I wish to perform rather than sinking
