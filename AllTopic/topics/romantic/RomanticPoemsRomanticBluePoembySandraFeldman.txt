You're eyes are blue,
The Sky is too,
Can love be also,
Color Blue?
I float away,
Images blue,
Today, they play,
A Waltz in blue,
A Rhapsody,
Also in Blue.
White is so pure,
But so is blue,
Blue oceans bring me,
Close to You,
Your eyes, your look,
The color blue,
Can love be just,
Blue thoughts of you?
