with casual gesture is raising
the goblet overfilled
with the cascade of words
to the mouth inexpressible
with the red rowan of persistent thoughts
like drops of blood is marking the road
to the white summerhouse of trysts
standing in the garden
wrapped with elaborate
tangles of bindweed and the Virginia creeper
leading the purpose through the drawbridge
he is encouraging participation in spring funs
sensitive breath of the wind what knocking with trees
is flying without the memory protracting
on the young greenness fields getting
it is beckoning rains of the spring storm
over to himself with the lightning
the poet is writing with heart
off whom one each drops of the red rowan
and tenderness of longing are falling...
