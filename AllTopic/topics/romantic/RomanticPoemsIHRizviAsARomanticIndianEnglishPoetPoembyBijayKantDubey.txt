Rizvi who used to teach English
And had been the Principal of
Tilak College, Bareilly, U.P.
Is not an academic,
But an editor ad a critic.
An Indian romantic poet,
He has to his credit,
Falling Petals, Unfading Blooms,
Thirsty Pebbles, Wandering Fragrance,
Wounded Roses Sing, Snowflakes of Dreams,
As his collections of poems.
Gathering Broken Glasses, Clouds in Cages,
Fettered Birds, Dripping Wounds,
Love Never Dies, Haiku & Other Poems,
The Valley Still Blossoms
As his works to add to his corpus.
A poet of love, colour and its romance,
Emotion and feeling
And passion,
Poetic frenzy,
The flight of imagination,
He is ever fresh, ever songful.
A romantic poet, he draws from
Keats, Wordsworth and Shelley,
He is a poet of beauty, truth and goodness,
Dreamy and fanciful,
Dwelling far,
Into the realms.
To talk of Rizvi is to talk of the making
Of a romantic,
The poet as an artist
And art as his vision,
The vision and mission of life,
Penetrating deep into.
