NICE ONE... ALL IN A PARK
we have a PARK*
adjoining
and
what we see here
is eyes worth opening
in the East you will say
its imagery
beyond your mind's imagining
can such things be done openly
You will say BLASPHEMY
AND
Love is eternal
roses are maternal
lovely sentiments
hope your wife knows in life
you have another one
you r 1/2 my age
or r u 1940?
can't hide from me your rage
sexiness spills
all can see
never mind
LOVE REALLY IS BLIND
two poems
ONE INSPIRED BY A SPIRITUALIST
THE SECONDA SEXIEST
BOTH ENJOY THEIR OWN WORLD OF CONTRAST
YET BOTH WILL TILL THEIR OWN TIME LAST
ERE THEY PASS
THE FLAG MAST
AS they alone
BY PASS
*COMMON FOR YOUNG KIDS
AND THOSE IN WILDER TEENS
PLUS
STARK EYED OLDIES
there is no nudity
at least
