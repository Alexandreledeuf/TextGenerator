I’ve written this poem to impress you.
Will you give your heart in exchange for a poem?
Perhaps you don’t even know how much you worth!
Still now you are only like my poems
And I am a poet who has composed you!
Why do I still watch movie on you so hazy
On the screen of imagination
In Romantic channel of thought!
I’ve searched for you in so many places!
I really don't know whether you will be here
by my side
In this life!
If I knew who are you
Where are you!
