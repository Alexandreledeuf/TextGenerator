The romantic hut
Sights holding
As from a bud
Flower blooming
Smell spreading,
For the beauty
Birds are singing,
Butterflies dancing
Saying it is spring,
It is spring,
Come all out of door,
Have a tour,
Sing a tone for life,
Life is nice, rich,
All are wealthy,
No one is poor;
Don't keep wrong
In mind's corner
Fill it with
Love and love,
Help one another
To be really happy
To lead life with peace
And prosperity.
