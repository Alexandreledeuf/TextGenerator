Romantic,
Romantic,
Who is a romantic,
The making of a romantic,
How the man behind the curtain
Is the thing to know?
Romantic,
Romantic,
The word is no doubt musical and magical,
But who is the romantic,
One who is full of colour and image,
Fancy and imagination,
Dream and fantasy?
Or one who is creative,
A lover of Nature,
Hills, rivers, woods and valleys,
The village and the country,
The landscape and the greenery
In full myth and mysticism?
Or one who transforms dreams into realities,
Imagines and creates
As per Nature's plan,
Envisages and transforms,
Loves man, birds and beasts,
Sees the things in astonishment,
The world and Nature?
Or one who is a loafer,
A rambler, a roamer moving
Aimlessly
On the road of life,
Parting like a Romeo,
Loving and dodging,
Cheating and deceiving?
