You come in and sit down while looking around
I tell you don’t be afraid just relax for this is your night
I’ve prepared all day for this one perfect night
Topped with music, food, wine and a flickering candle light
We eat, drink, laugh, and talk just for starters
I began to gaze into your stars stolen from the sky eyes
As you lay in my arms looking up at me in utter surprised
I stand you up and slowly walk you into my room
I began to undress you piece by piece
While the aroma of the room puts you at ease
I tell you to lie down flat on your stomach
Then your fantasy's and fascinations’ begin to run wild
Now I have a strong appetite for your love and I want it now
Yet the moment is not now so I tell myself to slow down
So I begin giving you a full body massage
Not just any massage I mean really caressing your every curve
Tonight I’m your servant and I’m ready to serve
I smell and inhale a deep breath of air from your hair
I slowly and passionfully kiss the back of your neck
As I go down your body, kissing alot and not missing a spot
You moan in acceptance and squirm in the sheets
I roll you over in a burst of excitement and delightment
I admire your body in its full entirety
For a second I pause, A body so beautiful even with flaws
I complete the front of you the same way I did your back
Paying close attention to areas that I need not mention
Your body begins to shiver and I know what that means
So I continue to go at it until you and your body screams
I can feel you blood pulsating as I slowly raise up
You whisper in my ear that you are ready to feel me
I waste no time because I'm ready to feel you to
A lovely feel of wetness and warmth as I slide into you
As we engage in this overwhelming love making
I hope you know my body is yours for the taking
our minds escapes this physical world to a place all of our own
We try all the position our little nympho minds can ponder
We are dripping wet so full of sweat
You have climaxed many of times
Then you tell me your ready for mines
Not wanted this to stop but I feel I have no choice
I feel you shiver and I join in the fun and now were done
Slowly this saga has come to a end
I hold you tight as we drift off to sleep
I tell you I love you and kiss you good night...
