In a moment it makes me romantic
Remove all sadness and show to be fantastic
The poems are made as my heaven
The slight ideas get fine place even
How words strike mind in quick succession?
Form nice imagination with fast obsession
Romance with female friends and bright moon light
Oh, what a lovely desire to be expressed truly right
Why those dark nights donâ€™t frighten me?
Why I touch all those stars and steal their twinkles in free?
Create their impression of sadness in fine poetical words
Feel so close to the almighty and spell it as holy from mouth of lords
Is poetry a means to cut jokes?
Cut some to size and unnecessarily poke
Does it not involve greater degree of appreciation?
I think it does and sometimes choke the throat and pronunciation
I try to control with tears and bring smile in between
But in fact it takes me to the extreme end and shows heaven
I take deep stock of it and compare what I get by composing poems
It is no less joy then what one gets from friends
I see with deep sense of human touch
Every time some incidence comes as such
I move with great care and involve
Rest ideas come in quickly and solve
It is divine blessing that you can think and form relation
An opinion about holy path, love or separation
How come you think with great pain about such sensitive things?
Unless you are gifted with invisible hands to create something
It is not poetic skill or some illogical presentation
It has even nothing to do with any kind of orientation
It is well imagined scene with mix of human feelings
That plays till end with souls together and willing
