Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
they wouldn't be red or blue,
without you,
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
I'll be stuck to you,
like glue,
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Poems express my love,
you do too!
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
It'll always be me,
and you.
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
I can never explain,
how much I love you...
