My heart loves you
My soul loves you
My eyes are missing you
I wish that your family agrees to marry me
But what can I do, it's something in your parents hands
I write letters to you all the time
I put a rose every day on the wall of your house
You are my life and my soul
Each beat of my heart is calling you, honey
I love you so much
I miss you so much
I wish that I can be with you someday
I wish that
'Best Wishes To You From Whole My Heart'
