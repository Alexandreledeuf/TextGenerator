I'm lost everytime I look into those eyes.
And yet you never let me peer through your disguise.
You leave my heart in disarray.
Babe...I really don't want to play.
I don't know why we couldn't be...you cut me deep,
like a chainsaw to a tree.
So for all those girls out there with the wrong man,
here I stand.
A bleeding heart, and I feel its all for naught'.
So forget that we ever shared the same thought.
