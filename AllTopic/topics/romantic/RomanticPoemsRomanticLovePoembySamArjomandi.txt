You and me, we both look like a fire
Every time we look into each other's eyes, the flame goes higher and  higher
Lets hold each other hands to keep the fire alive
that's the only way our relationship can survive
Love without the romance can't go on forever
is like a car without the gas, that love is going nowhere
Romantic love makes your heart happy and your life sweet
Once you try it, you will never quit
Among all the reasons why we should be together
Lets romantic love to be the one, that hold us together
