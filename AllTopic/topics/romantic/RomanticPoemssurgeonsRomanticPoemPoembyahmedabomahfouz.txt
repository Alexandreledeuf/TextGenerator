And surgeons disagreed with each other
Dr / Hussam: excise all the tumors
Dr / Salah: treat him by radiotherapy and chemotherapy
Dr / Mokhles: leave him to die

His mother was crying
While he was smiling
Then asked her Mum, think with me
The cancer enlarges everywhere
and its cells swim in my blood
its cells are undifferentiated
doctors don't know from where it came
it is from my heart
and when it grows, my heart grows
so I loved the whole world and loved its creator
cancer cells which went every where
visited my fingers
so I wrote the poems
haunted my brain and caused some pain
although increased its tension
but increased my attention
Mum, she travelled to Dubai
Incidence of cancer will increase in Asia
But her carcinogen femininity
Will remain in the Egyptian boy's heart
Mum, I want the operation
which is touching my hand
but she is the surgeon and she is the nurse
and I want the radiotherapy
from her eyes irradiation
and from her teeth flash
and I want the chemotherapy
a crumb of bread
she puts between my lips
then I want to die
on her bosom
