I call myself poet
But remainquiet
When someone offers love
I hardly can believe
Love is such world
That it can be called holier than the lord
The word itself has solution
You can make straight away the resolution
Nobody can stall
Your path and call
It as futile way
Your journey has meaningful stay
I have seen riverflowing
The birds make chirping
The wind makes silent blow
I find it all in nature's glow
Love is in my blood
I find it in neighborhood
I also see it in all objects
Love is omnipresent and this is fact
Love makes your presence
And expresses true essence
Avail if you have chance
Feel no worries or remain tense
