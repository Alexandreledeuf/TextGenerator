On such a cloudy day why you are far away?
Lightning is writing in sky what I want to say
The cloudy sky is like my gloomy face
The thunderbolts are showing my distress
The raindrops are like my sorrowful tears
My soul is on your way like pioneers
The murmur of the leaves is like my whisper
Please meet me in such a romantic weather
