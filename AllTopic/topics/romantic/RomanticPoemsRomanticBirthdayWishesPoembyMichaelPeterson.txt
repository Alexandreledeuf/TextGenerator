Candle lights, a bed of petals
A sprinkle of roses
A table with the candles lit
Two plates, two wine glasses
A rosy birthday cake, a bottle of wine
Soft music playing in the background
A loving tune flowing thru the air
Beautiful you coming down the stairs
A glowing angel with a gorgeous smile
Sent from the heavens above
A Birthday surprise and a tearful joy
A romantic night for you to cherish
Like a scene from the movies
The beautiful actress gets her man
A dream that comes true
Tears of joy and surprise
Wishing you a loving Birthday
Full of love and joy
A kiss and a slow dance
Holding you tightly, whispering
Happy Birthday and loving you
A birthday wish for you comes true
