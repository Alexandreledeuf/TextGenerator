Lovers love
to smile and dance
as it's the first step to
ROMANCE
LOVE IT O Poet
LOVE IS THE ONLY ONE WORD
FOR WHICH ALL HANKER
Life is just an accident
born out of love
and blessed are those
who become the outcome of such a volition
and
life is born in another Form
we reincarnate to be another one
in love to be born
again and again
but in different Norm
come love me O Poet me
if you want to
just for once
come in the rain with me
get drenched
remove all your attire
we are Divine aren't we...
my beauty lies in my concealment
you want to see upfront
first come and show yourself
O Poet
then you may turn me around
till then just admire
the wettest silky attire
love me first
eredisaster comes
love is just for one
and only once..
DEAR DAVE
PEACE BE WITH THEE
The moon replied
How much happier I'd have been
if you had shown the lower half
all naked to me
with my sexiness
you wanted to compare O lady
I am more beautiful than thee
Years don't age nor frail me
your beauty just lasts
till end of YOUR virginity
but still I can see ye
You too are as beautiful
but not more than me
good Dears all
do read my poem
MOMS SMILES
U'D LOVE IT
