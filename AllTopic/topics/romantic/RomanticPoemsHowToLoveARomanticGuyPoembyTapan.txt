The romantic one is the rarest one
And he is just not like the other folks
You must learn, my dear, how to talk
To him, unlike those common folks.
Don't bore him with your silly folk tales
He has finer tastes, not coarse like ale
Don't expect of him the heathen tongues
Or folk dance set to cheap barbaric songs.
Talk to him in sweetness, of love, romance
Reach out to his heart with gentle cadence
Utter not a rude word, a single rude word
Or play with him silly, dirty mind games
For he of gentle nature might take offence
And once his mood is off
He may for ever switch off
What shall you gain by losing such a one
A romantic guy is the rarest one
If ever you find a romantic man
Latch on to him as fast as you can
For once he goes, you'll never ever
Find in this life another for sure.
He of classic mind will abhor folk things
He'll seek harmony in even littlest things
Don't expect him to folk dance
For he'll dance ballet in the evenings
And he'll take you to the night's ball
And waltz you down the aisle
And lock his rings with your rings.
Your Kashmiri is at best a folk dance
While Odishi has a pure classical stance
If you want to be in love with the Classics
Just leave your folks behind, and embrace
Some of your lover's romantic basics.
Bring him to mood with your sweetest words
If sweet ones you know not, just avoid rude words
Reach out to him with your sweetest songs
And he is sure to sing his own sweet songs
Soon your melody will make his heart dance
And in his hour of joy he'll quickly embrace
You to his bosom in thrall, my dear Beloved
As a sweet wife in love to her man belonged.
