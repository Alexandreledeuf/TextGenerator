My wife says I'm not romantic,
I don't suppose I am
I think I'm just an average bloke
Doing the best I can;
I think about my lady
And not just now and then
I tell her that I love her
As much as other men.
But this is  NOT  romantic
It's just not good enough!
She wants the constant flattery
She wants the gooey stuff;
Not just every weekend
Or even days between
She wants the flowers hourly
And treating like a queen.
If truth be told, I'm lazy
And think it doesn't matter
I haven't got the eloquence,
The charm, the chat, the patter;
I've got to be quite honest,
Straightforward and pedantic
My wife is right, I'm not
And never will be a romantic.
