You are my whole on my trip,
I love to travel on your ship.
My hope is to reach that land,
To give you a red flower by my hand.
You make me feel in peace,
You divide me into many pieces.
We are alone at that place,
We are rarely in that case.
We are alone in this room,
When my red flower starts to bloom.
I muse on your face under the full moon,
When my favorite music blasts to drum.
After you read my letter,
You make my mind  quieter,
By your smile so sweeter.
