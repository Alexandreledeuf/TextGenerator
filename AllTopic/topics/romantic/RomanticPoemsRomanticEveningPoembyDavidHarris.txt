In a candle lit room
with an open fires glow,
you sit arm in arm
passing the evening through.
A bearskin rug under your feet
and the romantic evening
feels almost complete.
You bring the wine from the cooler
and both of you sip it gently.
Your hearts beat faster
with the warmth inside of you
and your kisses are like fire
and urge you to go on.
Then the door opens
and her parents tell you
in no uncertain terms
to get out and go home.
