A romantic song I dedicate,
To you from my heart's gate,
Tender love is what I want,
I hope you will certainly grant!
Life seems bleak as the ashes,
If love doesn't colour the mind,
Then even in the midst of many,
Sheer loneliness I find.
A romantic song I dedicate,
To you from my heart's gate,
Tender love is what I want,
I hope you will certainly grant!
Love is what your synonym is,
Your love makes me free,
Hold me ever closer,
Hatred I never want baby.
A romantic song I dedicate,
To you from my heart's gate,
Tender love is what I want,
I hope you will certainly grant!
