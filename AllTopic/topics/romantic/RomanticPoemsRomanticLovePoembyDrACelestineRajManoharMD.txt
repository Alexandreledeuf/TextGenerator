Love is not of minds alone;
Love is not of hearts that yearn;
Love is not of bodies entwined;
Love is more than the finest wine!
Love is not just when eyes see;
Love is not just when ears hear;
Love is not all sensory;
Love is more than what you dream!
Love is not of earthly mould;
Love is not human-designed;
Love is not ephemeral;
Love is more – predestined!
Love is not of sex, age, race;
Love is not for earth’s life-span;
Love is not togetherness;
Love is more- Eternity!
