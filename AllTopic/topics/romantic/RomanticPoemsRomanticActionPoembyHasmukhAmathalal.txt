We become sentimental
And go on the dark side of moral
Why not we think of sunny side?
When world for is so wide!
Why do not you write about deep love?
The ideals you believe in
The desire you have in heart
Always to be with her as inseparable part!
Love shall be only driving factor
Where you are romantic actor
The stage is fully open
For you to dance and sing even
Right about nature
Its change for coming future
Lovely and beautiful flowers
With natural rainy showers
Think and write about future union
How will you be bending down with affection?
What shall be your first reaction when see her?
Such shall be befitting offer!
