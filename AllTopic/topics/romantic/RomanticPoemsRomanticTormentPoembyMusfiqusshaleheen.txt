essence and colors of twilight
ceased my heart,
yet still I have looped
on your thinking, my darling
snowflakes have covered the trees
underneath cold wind blows from north
My spirit become low,
what a teach of the nature!
darkest horizon what it has meant,
that threats my nights and days-
stars have blended, apart from hopes
clouds are whirling on drifted edge,
dreams have broken,
run with autumnal cloud
I can rather want to you,
my darling
As alluring attention that dies,
with illusion and hallucination
The last -
ever and forever,
my confession
I will die with a claim
of romantic torment,
â€˜O' darling and you will face,
the rude reality at the end -
