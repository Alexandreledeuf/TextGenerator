Why you are searching me
among the lillies
You won't find me in the valleys
Don't you feel me honey
I amÂ  in your heart
Just close your eyes and sense me
Yes I am there in your mind
Never divulge to anyone
the romantic moments we spend together
Keep the purity of romance intact
Enjoy this love and sleep tight
Still I am in your dreams
Hug me tight and keep me close
Listen to my sweet song and
You will get those goosebumps
