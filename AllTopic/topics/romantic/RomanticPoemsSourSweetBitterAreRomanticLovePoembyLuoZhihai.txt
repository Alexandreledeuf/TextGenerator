★Sour, Sweet, Bitter Are Romantic Love.
☆Luo Zhihai Lyrics & Translation
Listened to you murmured on the phone.
You doted and took pity on me.
You tired of drifting dreaming home
Weak lovesickness between you and me.
Dear Ah Hua, my dear sweetheart,
Please came with a bunch of wild lily.
Full of fragrance of spring around me.
My soft and weak heart was not alone.
Saw that you were into a trance.
You sincerely liked and loved me.
Your glowing eyes were burning love.
Both of us fell in love, fell in love.
Dear Ah Hua, my dear sweetheart,
Please went with a heart to heart lock.
Huangshan Hill Clouds changed magic so much.
Head over heels we were in love.
In spring, summer, autamn and winter.
You like a fire, I look of love.
Dawn, night, wind, rain, moon and sun, .
I am not weak after your care.
Love each other forever, we love.
Sour, sweet, bitter are romantic love.

★酸甜苦辣都是浪漫情歌
☆罗志海歌词
聆听你喃喃地反复 诉说
你耐心地宠我哄我怜我
你梦萦故乡厌倦了漂泊
两地相思身心疲惫脆弱
亲 爱的阿华哥呀阿华哥
请你来时带一束野百合
满屋飘逸芬芳明媚春色
婀娜芳心从此远离 寂寞
看见你痴痴地失魂落魄
你真心地疼我惜我爱我
你炽热的双眼燃烧爱火< br>你有情我有意情投意合
亲爱的阿华哥呀阿华哥
请你走时带一把连心锁
黄山云海 翻腾神奇莫测
携手连心我俩永沐爱河
寒风凛冽再度骄阳似火
你热情似火我含 情脉脉
彩霞满天瞬间大雨滂沱
你细心呵护我不再柔弱
我俩一起饱经爱恨折磨
酸甜苦辣都是浪漫情歌
