After a long time
I have taken my diary
To compose some verses
By sitting on the couch
In my balcony on this full moon night.
My  thoughts seem to be paralysed
And my poetic mind like a physician
Tries to cure them in stead of writing verses.
The moon is walkiing but staring at me
And the romantic night is laughing at me  silently.
It seems to be  impossible
To compose the lovely verses
In the romantic light.
The happy conversation between us
Will not go on tonight.
My dreams are silent
Not to play with the moonlight.
