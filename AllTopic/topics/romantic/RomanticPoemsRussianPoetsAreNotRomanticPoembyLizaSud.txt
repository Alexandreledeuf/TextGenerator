Russian poets are not romantic.
Because nights here are very cold.
And to catch just one moment ecstatic -
You should be very quick and bold.
There is no romantics in Joseph,
Balmont - angel with shattered dreams.
And Verblessness of sorrow -
that is the Russian theme.
Loneliness is coldness.
I love it - so let it be.
It was not cold in snowy Kronstadt
since saint John became altruist.
He said to the one: 'I live for you' -
and there was a uniting flame,
that washed out all selfish sorrow,
and consumed the world by Christ's fame.
