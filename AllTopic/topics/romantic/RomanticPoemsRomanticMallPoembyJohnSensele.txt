The opportunity to love is common to all
Adults, the able-bodied, the infirm and children
Who love from the bottom of their hearts in a romantic mall.
Loving someone blesses love sources in Fall
When lovebirds hold hands and write love poems with their pen.
The opportunity to love is common to all.
Love and love some more until the call
Of love becomes an ingrained habit in women
Who love from the bottom of their hearts in a romantic mall.
Hazel Fidelia loved John at first sight in a college hall
Where John taught her to draw diagrams Venn.
The opportunity to love is common to all.
Become a love spender; don't be a love vendor but a love sender, tall
Lover who with other lovebirds maintain love and sustain sistren
Who love from the bottom of their hearts in a romantic mall.
Love even when from your lover you receive no phone call
To titillate your heart, to tingle your stomach pit when
The opportunity to love is common to all
Who love from the bottom of their hearts in a romantic mall.
