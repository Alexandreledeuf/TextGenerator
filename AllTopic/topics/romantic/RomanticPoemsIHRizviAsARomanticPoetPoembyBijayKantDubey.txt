Iftikhar Hussain Rizvi is one of those Indian English poets
Of the seventies
Who seek to adhere to and perfect
The romantic traits rather than taking
Any other contemporary realms.
The kernel of romanticism he has definitely got
From the English and European masters and their theories of poetry which they used in
While practising their verse
And Rizvi can be o exception to it
As because he has taught and read English as a teacher.
Somewhere he seems to be leaning to Urdu lyrics and lyricism
Seen in the composition of shayaris
And he a shayar of these, a lyric writer,
Writing the lyrics of love, soulfully, heartfully.
To read Rizvi is come to feel that roses too appear
To be wounded and bleeding
If the heart is sad and broken and the ache of the heart,
None but Keats felt it.
Laila's pains are therein; those of Majnu's, burning for
Each other, pining for,
But the heartless, medievalist people cannot let them meet.
A lover's heart is the space of his writing and he inducts in dream, Colour, fancy and imagination to paint his ideas and images.
He is a lover; a dreamer who keeps loving and dreaming about
Man and the world,
Falling Petals, Unfading Blooms, Thirsty Pebbles,
Wandering Fragrance, Wounded Roses Sing.
Snowflakes of Dreams, Gathering Broken Glasses, Clouds in Cages, Fettered Birds, Dripping Wounds, Love Never Dies,
Haiku & Other Poems, The Valley Still Blossoms and others
The poetry-books to add to his corpus.
