He holds a heart full of romance,
He does not want to miss any chance,
Of displaying his romantic manner,
Before others everywhere.
He never goes frantic,
Since itâ€™s good to be romantic,
With a sound mind and heart,
The things that he never does part.
He believes in love, dreams, and adores nature,
He is emotional, subjective and revolutionary ever.
