You told me once
My care is amazing
You enlightened me
My eyes are passionate
I understood right away
Intention of your lie
Conceived you then
As a romantic liar
I am hypnotized
By stimulating splendour
Your adoring features
Touched innocent sense
Aggressive and obsessive
Kiss, knotted me to you
You were sensitive
Not to let me free
You became my dream
You became my psyche
You became my vision
You became my life
When I tie the knot
Masquerade taken out
Exemplified your
Inner parts of guts
I am aware now
You entrapped me
I want to find out
A romantic lie to escape
Flee from you at once
Glided on seven skies
Voyaged ocean limits
Probing for harmony
When I turned around
Find your burning tears
Dear, Iâ€™m back again
To be with you forever
How I save my face
Grab your lovely heart
I am searching for
Another romantic lie
