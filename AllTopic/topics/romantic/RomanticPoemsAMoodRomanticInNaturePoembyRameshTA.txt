Dreams and imaginations foster romantic mood
Influenced and inspired by beauty of Nature.
Emotion and sentiments occupy romantic life;
Adventure and exploration mark romantic venture;
Rapture and rupture are part of romantic life.
Romance is the essence of love life in the world;
Interest and thrill of romance will never die here;
Otherwise life is monotonous and boring dead weight!
