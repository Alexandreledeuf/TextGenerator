I hope that you realize your confessions are a burden to me
Much as I love you like a brother, your words are corrupting me
I don't really know what possesses you to unburden yourself to me
Is 'sister confessor' tattoed in my forehead for everyone to see
You claim that your wife is lovely and treats you right
So why on earth do you go to these clubs and have menage a trois
You say you feel so guilty, yet compartmentalize your life
Once her Lexus is out of the garage,  down the drain it goes your facade
I will never betray you, I will never tell her
And I want you to know I will not fall under your spell
Get over yourself, you juvenile clown
Get real, smell the coffee and frown
