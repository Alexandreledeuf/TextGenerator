Passion and friendship started this love affair
And total friendship, had to much to share
I with my baggage, so broken from the past
You with yours, wanted a love that could last
We must have talked hours on the phone each day
At might in my head, our conversations I’d replay
You were so gentle, the kindest man I ever knew
I was so afraid, but my trust because of you grew
I had kissed so many toads to find my prince
You’ve been understanding and loving ever since
The happiest day, was when I became your wife
I’ll love you forever dear, you are my life
At times, we may have our ups and downs
Will have lots of laughs and no more frowns
I write this as our anniversary gets near
To let you know you are very dear
With all my love to my wonderful husband and best friend
Any heartache I had, you could mend
Thank you for these glorious years
With lots of smiles and no more tears!
