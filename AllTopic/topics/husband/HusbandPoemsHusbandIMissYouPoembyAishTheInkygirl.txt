Since you've been away,
i feel an empty space that can never be replaced.
Everyday i have to feel these tears roll down my face,
because of all the memories i just cant erase.
Hubby i just need to have you home.
It hurts me too much when i hear your voice over a phone.
2 weeks jared? that is way too long.
By then im sure my mind will be gone, but for you mi amor,
i will stay strong, i will hold on.
I feel so lost without you.
Move on & live my life? i don't want to.
To be honest that is something my heart wont let me do.
No matter how many timez i try.
My love is to strong to be with you.
You're the one & only man for me.
I truely believe we were meant to be.
Every day that i live without you i feel my heart breaking.
With every breath im taking,
every move im making & every smile im faking.
HUBBY I LOVE YOU.
I'll be right here...
Waiting.
