My Darling can't you see?
How very much you mean to me?
On this Our day, I've come to say;
I love you more and more each day.
Mere words alone, cannot express;
The love I feel, the tenderness,
The joy, and happiness my dear;
In knowing you are always near.
When you are down, and feeling blue;
I hope the sun comes shining through,
To cheer you up, and make life glow;
Because my dear I love you so.
May the Lord bless and keep you in His way;
And guide your footsteps day by day;
And may your cup of life overflow;
Because my dear I love you so.
