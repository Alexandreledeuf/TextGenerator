Crippled with anger
Crippled with fear
My heart is aching
My eyes fill with tears
You tell me I'm bad, that I'm a loser
You're my husband, you're my abuser
I'm afraid to stay...
Afraid to leave
I'm scared to love you
Scared to believe
Your behavior keeps me so confused
There's so much pain
I feel so used
You've kept me so long
Under your spell
My heart feels so lonely
I'm as empty as a shell
All you gave was pain and sorrow
Not much hope for a bright tomorrow
Longing for a tender touch
A gentle voice
Will this painful life be my only choice?
A river of tears
So many lost years
~~~~~
At last, I'm free - I sent you away
Now, each nite I vow to pray
I thank the Lord for giving me strength
From now on - I'll keep you at length
You've set me free Lord - You made me brave
I promise I'll never be...
Another man's slave
