Everytime I talk to God,
You are always part of my prayer.
I know he made you,
With a heart to love meâ€¦
Saving my heart for you in my future
Just in case you want to be part of my journey,
But you don't need to be perfect,
Just be a man in prayers..
I will love you despite of your imperfections,
I won't define you by your past,
I take you to be my best friend and lover,
Just be a man with a heart of gold..
I do not know what you are doing right now,
But someday I believe our path will cross,
I'd love to meet you, and then stand before you,
And I'd like to love you one day..
Potentially yours,
