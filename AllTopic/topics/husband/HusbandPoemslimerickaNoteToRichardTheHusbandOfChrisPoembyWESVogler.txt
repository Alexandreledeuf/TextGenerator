(limerick)A Note To Richard, The Husband of Chris
The work that you did in our kitchen
I would have to report has been bitchen
That's to say it was great
It really does rate
This is stated without a restrichen
And the bathroom is looking good too
Done with min'mal amount of to-do
With this we are happy...
Both mammy and pappy...
You brightened the look of the loo.
