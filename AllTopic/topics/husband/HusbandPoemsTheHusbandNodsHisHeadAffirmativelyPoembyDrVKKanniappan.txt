By day and night, throughout all the day,
the husband crossing his legs one over the other,
his eyes fixed to the laptop computer,
if the wife swirling her tongue in her own way
in all the four cardinal directions
and showers not-to-be heard scolding words,
the husband nods his head affirmatively
and says 'yes! yes! you are right'!
