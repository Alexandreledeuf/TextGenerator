Husbands, from the very foundation of the earth
Were given the right to be head of their homes.
They are leaders, builders, protectors, and providers.
You see, their shoulders are wide and their arms
are strong ready and able to lift and carry any load.
They've been purposely equipped to do and be.
They were created in God's image.
Therefore they speak God's Word
over their wives as a cleanser.
She was taken and formed from his rib
A place so close and dear to his heart.
They are warriors.
They are a strong foundation of any home.
