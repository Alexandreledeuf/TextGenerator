Husband and wife
Wives are considered as an obedient
They live happily and serve at present
The husband and children are taken care of
Despite you dig at her and make laugh
Generally husbands are blamed
For taking views one sided
Go to her only for sexual abuse
Give all what is needed to defuse the tension
She has lot more things to take into account
The pressure is on to mount
She hides pain from mere devotional point
"Ideal wife" as she prefers to be painted
Children may stay inclined
Husbands too very heavily fined
For not caring ailing partner
This is really bad factor
Let us be reasonable
Some of the accusation invite troubles
As husband has to earn and maintain
Despite taking jheavy economic burden
