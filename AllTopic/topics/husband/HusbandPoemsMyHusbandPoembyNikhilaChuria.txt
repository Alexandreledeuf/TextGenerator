Oh, my husband!
My sweet beloved;
My love for you could not be measured;
Your love is all that I have treasured.
You give me hope;
When I lay low;
You keep me warm;
In the cruel winter snow;
You hold me tight;
As my tears flow;
You give my life;
A precious glow.
Your kind smile and warm gestures;
Your humbleness and sweet forgiveness;
Your patience and virtuous nature;
Make me the luckiest wife ever.
You held my arms;
When I stumbled in the dark;
You wept my tears;
When I cried out aloud;
You kept me alive;
When I slowly withered;
You brightened my life;
Like a mighty wizard.
Oh my husband;
My sweet beloved;
For you, I shall live this life and the next;
And all the lives to come ahead.
