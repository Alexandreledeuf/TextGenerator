There is no body without soul; there is no soul without body,
Similarly both the husband and wife, united together as one,
Should live like he cherishing flower and honey!
If the so called husband and wife differ and conflict,
So to say, it is similar to the living body and soul fight
With each other and they spoil themselves and get lost!
