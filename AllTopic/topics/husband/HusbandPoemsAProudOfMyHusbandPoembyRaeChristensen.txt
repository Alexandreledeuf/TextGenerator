My husband Vinny Christensen
He's now thirty seven, but he looks younger
He has beautiful eyes with his sweet smile
Making my heart beats a little faster.
He works as technical consultant at Telenor
Never felt bored solving problems for his customers
He has a lot of wonderful colleagues
Ronny, Daniel are so sweet, they are his best partners.
Vinny loves so much his music
He's fantastic, all the lyrics he wrote
He makes wonderful words rhymes
Melody's brighten like blue skies, made me cry some time I suppose.
He has the rhythms in his heart
Writing a song so fast, he is a talented
Playing all the music instruments he can
Piano, Guitar, Ukelele, etc. I don't understand..Why he's so fascinated!
He's now writing me a beautiful song
He said not so long he will totally complete it
RAE is the name he named his latest song
It will be the greatest as it belongs, he makes me really appreciated!
I love my husband so much
My face is all blushed like a light pink rose
He is a perfect wonderful and gently man
Like white sparkling sand, he's the man I chose!
