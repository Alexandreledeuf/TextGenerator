Feelings that were true and deep
awoke my heart from its innocent sleep.
How enchanting it was to find a love
so very dear to keep.
Because of you, my soul has soared
to love's golden throne,
and, I will always yearn for you, and
you alone.
Without you, there would be no
sunshine or laughter.
My life would be incomplete and sad
ever-after.
The song in my heart would have an empty,
meaningless tone,
for, I love but you, and you alone.
