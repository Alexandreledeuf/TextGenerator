My life, My body is now shared,
But, it seems so fair,
As marriage made us pair,
Even though I dont always tell you,
I Love You,
Glad am married to you,
At times we are rough,
At times we are soft,
But, you always have a big heart,
That makes our love grow stronger,
I am lucky to be part of your life,
I am honoured to be your wife,
You shared my good times,
And at bad times stood like a rock,
I dream about our sweet yesterdays,
And our beautiful tommorow.
Never thought I could be loved so much,
But, you made me feel,
Year after year.
Everyday, Now I pray,
For the every new life,
I remain your wife.
