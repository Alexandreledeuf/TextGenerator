battered husbands too exist
a wife kicking his strong feet
slapping his rugged jaw
insulting him in front of his
friends and shouting at
him while talking breakfast
she collars him and spits
on him, his decency trampled
like a rug at the door
where she cleans her feet
from all dirt where she
stamps on his privacy
i see him smile through
all these, as though nothing
really matters, nothing
to mind nothing to be
taken seriously
she was once beautiful
a face he always adore
something wrong went
somewhere,
she went wild in the
desert of her longings
she fell on the deep abyss
of her mind
she lost her senses
on some unacceptable
pains
she cries in the wilderness
as though her soul
is taken somewhere else
and here he is
this battered husband
watching him with so
much understanding
her doctor will be coming
again today
for her injections
