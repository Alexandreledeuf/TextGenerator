You're everything I wanted and hoped you would be
You're the very best thing that's ever happened to me
Because of you I know who I am
I know where I'm going
I sure it was meant for me to love you
and just as sure it was meant for you too
My greatest wish is always be together
To find each other all over again
and know this is forever
So thank you for choosing me to share you're life
and even more for being you're wife
