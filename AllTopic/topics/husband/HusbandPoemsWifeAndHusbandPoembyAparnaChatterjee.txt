Nurtured, sheltered and loved
is the way I feel
whenever you are with me
I love you and you love me
the feeling gives me ecstasy
I believe you and you’ve believed in me
for all the time you’ve known me
Living with you
has been a dream come true
Cherishing every moment
I live with you
Wedded life has been bliss
You’ve given me a home, a son,
and an angel too,
A lovely daughter
for me and you...
A family to call my own,
I’m your blessed wife...
Having you as my husband
has been a ‘blessing in disguise’ for me!
