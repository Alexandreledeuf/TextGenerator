The one, woman, who stands before the husband
Making him extremely angry by words and deeds
Is similar to ‘Yama’ (God of death) !
The one, woman, who is not entering
Into the kitchen in the early morning,
To prepare food for the bread earning husband
Is like a deadly disease to her husband!
The one, woman, who eats herself alone
Whatever she cooked without serving to
Her husband is a living demon in the home!
These three attitudes of a woman
Are the armaments which affect the health
Of her husband and may lead to his death!

It happened recently in Bangalore,
The wordy quarrel between husband and wife!
(May be wife provoked)
Both are IT professionals!
Mentally disturbed Husband
Stabbed and killed his wife,
Jumped from 13th floor,
Ended his life too!
