In promises of winter end,
was our beginning.
My aching heart beats quicker at the mention of your name.
My soul longs for your touch.
The evening descends; on great owl wings.
I am calmed by your aromas;
It carries me into the dawn;
and your eyes hold me as none before.
I am filled hoping I may be the desire of your heart.
As my lips fall upon yours,
may you know you are my heart desire?
I look for the last gestures of winter end.
I remember my husband,
our day we became as one.
Those years have passed us by,
I still remember that winter day;
as it was yesterday.
My feverish hand lifts to your face.
that we may kiss as one.
We walk hand to hand as husband and wife.
As We began our life a new,
until my last dying breathe.
I Love You.
