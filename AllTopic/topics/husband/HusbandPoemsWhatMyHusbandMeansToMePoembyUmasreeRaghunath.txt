Loving, caring, sharing and everything
taking me as such and my anything
giving me love, hope and peaceful life
making me his charming young little wife
Not just my friend and a dear husband
but my very soul till my very end
at least a second before him I should sleep
to enjoy that heavenly eternal bliss
less ambitious but more understanding
He gets me the ultimate that money can never buy
It ofcourse at times make me cry
The depth of his love is true
every minute cherishing it as new
husbands like him are very few
I love him, love him and love him too
Great will be our couple as days go by
Model will be we before we do die
love that will never have a try
for it all began with a hue and cry
but no more tears and fears
with my Man in my life to endear
I love this alot as his adorable wife
I love you darling husband, love you in life!
