Wife and husband
Are pious both
There is no
Sexual immorality
In them.
Let each man
Have his own wife
Let each woman
Have her own husband
Let the husband
Render to his wife
Affection due to her
Let the wife
Love her husband
The body of the husband
Belongs to his wife
And the body of the wife
Belongs to her husband
They do not deprive
One another except with
Consent and they should
Maintain self-control.
Self control is the best
For the good of the society.
