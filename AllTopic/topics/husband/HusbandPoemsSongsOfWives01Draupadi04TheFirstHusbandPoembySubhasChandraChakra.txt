King Yudhisthira,
The eldest of Pandavas-
You were the first
The first to wed me,
The first to woo me
into ways of conjugation,
The first to show me my Dharma,
My ways of wifehood
My moments of conjugal pleasure
shone with the Sun that was you,
of all my husbands
you were-
the softest at heart,
the love off your heart flowed
to my barren virgin soul
that made me wet with
all the sweet fragrances
of the world around.
Till that moment of conjugation
in that hour of that first night
I felt life -
a great riddle,
Puzzles drove me dizzy,
Questions numerous
made me crazy,
My breath was beyond
my control, like my wears
both outer and inner-
of my body, mind and soul.
I was a timid girl of sixteen
till I met you,
and till your arms
made me feel comfortable
and a friend at bay.
