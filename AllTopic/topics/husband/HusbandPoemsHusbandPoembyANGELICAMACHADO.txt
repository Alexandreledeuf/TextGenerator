I never knew what love meant until I met you
Your always there for me
Whenever I need you
You worry so much for me
And I do too
That when we are not together
We miss each other all the way through.
You always comfort me
When I'm sad
You try so hard to make me happy
Even when I'm mad,
I dont know sometimes how you put up with me
I guess thats very nice
To have a wonderfull husband
Always by my side.
