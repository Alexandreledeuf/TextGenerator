The days were bright
But remained light
Showing me no further purpose
So I chose you
You proved to be my diamond
Beautiful and handsome husband
Caring and affectionate
What more should I state?
I was guideless
And bore no smile on face
Today I am happiest person
And feel like to have got heaven
Today you have birth date
I wish you good luck and rate
One of the most lovely and faithful
I really feel
My life would have been still dry
If he had not entered holy tie
Today I feel not only safe and secured
But really stand admired
