Unless both the wife who has enormous love
…and the husband himself too unitedly taking vow,
decidedly drive the cart of highly beautiful and happy life;
And if it is driven by one of them only,
…the life will not run smoothly, the so called cart
of family life shall come to a standstill with hurdles!
