You're my husband
What I'll never meet
You're my husband
What I'll neve see close to me
You're my husband
With whom I'll never speak
The nicest words for you
Will never be heard
My tender caress
Will never be felt
My love to You will shine in dark
And no one will feel it
'Cause I want to give it
Only for you, my honey
You'll never call me your baby
No one tender word for me
I'll never read from your lips
Could You tell me
Why is it so?
