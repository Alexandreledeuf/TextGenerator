If the wife follows the principles
...of her husband and leads her life,
does what he says then and there itself
...without getting anger and displeasure,
without opposing even if he commands angrily;
...appreciate and obeys him pleasingly,
the husband understands her good qualities;
...admires and glorifies her, safeguards forever!
