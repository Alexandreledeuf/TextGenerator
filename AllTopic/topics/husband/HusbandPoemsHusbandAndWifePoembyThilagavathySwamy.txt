Husband and Wife relationship is like mind and heart association,
Less co-ordination between both;  will lead to disconnection,
Tolerance is bondage; intolerance may lead to extrication,
Understanding of both sides is very important for relation.
Marriage is a  distress; when there is misinterpretation,
To lead a society happily; relationship is a foundation,
Broken relationship is equivalent to misconception,
Better to separate instead of suffering in confusion.
