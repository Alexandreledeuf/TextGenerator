you seem so tired
you seem so exhausted
your not wanting steps
are clearly visible,
it makes me realize
things are not right
in our beautiful relationship;
your stupid'talks
your nonstop' songs
your gesture of love'
your kiss
your hugs-
were appreciated every time
it makes me smile;
my mood swings to right
honey! what has changed you and your mind?
honey! why you have become so quiet?
