What ever happened to the husband and wife
What ever happened to love
What ever happened to the dreams they thought right
That they both thought so much of
What ever happened to the holding of hands
Or the whispers of secrets to keep
Did it somehow slip away with the time
Is it somewhere still hidden beneath
What ever happened to the words I do
Replaced now with words of cruel
Does somehow it still linger on
Is love only lost and confused
What ever happened to the romance
And the love that was in each breath we took
Must somehow be forgotten now
Was this in the chances we took
What ever happened to the husband and wife
What ever happened to love
What will now happen to the rest of our lives
For love, was it overlooked
What will now happen to the dreams we once had
When the world was right at our feet
Is love somehow still hidden somewhere
Or is this the way it must be
There once was a time when it meant so much more
When love walked with us in life
What ever happened to the love in our hearts
What happened to the husband and wife.
