*obviously, I mean not him, but for the fact that he has to work so late so often... sigh.... :)
So, how did it happen?
Tell me. How, where and when?
And how dare you enchant me
with every dash of your pen?
How dare you turn this
(admittedly romantic-ish fool)
with a hug and a kiss
into your very own tool?
That Miss Independent, who would live on her own;
that 'I don't need anyone, I'm fine all alone',
that runner-awayer,
excusing delayer,
belligerently expecting
a life of neglecting....
wishing to have a retreat, to retain my own place,
to hold back at whim, have 'emotional space'....
Miss Independent!
Miss 'leave-me-alone'!
Miss 'I am hell-bent
on having time on my own! '
Miss 'Do not intrude, I will do it MY way'
Miss 'I am not listening - you may NOT have your say! '
How did it happen?
Tell me... when, how and where?
Reassure me, my husband, you'll always be there.
I was, I think, just quite simply Miss-judging
in what I have grown so to utterly loving.
And the Miss-this, Miss-that, and the Miss that was true
is only ever, in your absence, the 'Wife Misses You'.
