B-eautiful bride and groom
E-xpects a happy marriage;
M-onday March thirteenth,
B-oth of them turn the page.
O-ne in the eyes of God, they never  go separate ways;
L-ove and care for each other are always in proper place.
&
M-arried couple can understand
E-ach other's feeling and emotion;
L-iving a life in harmony
I-s their mutual passion.
N-o one can ever break them,
D-espite the stormy weather;
A-iming to last a lifetime, husband and wife forever.
