The woman with chastity
..Is like the nectar to her husband!
A person who is learnt and behaves accordingly
..Is like the nectar to the society!
A country with growth and welfare
..Is like the nectar to the king who rules!
The king who has his high flag raised up to the sky
..Will rule and do all good to the people in his country!
Similarly, while the soldier also does the favorable
..Deeds to the king, he is like nectar to the king!
