We swim a few times
across the water
where people float
and enjoy at the deepest place
the well-being that the pool
brings magically,
before we wrap our arms around each other
and recoil in the water up and down
and a few rascals
splashes us totally wet.
While we drink ginger ale
lying on our towels,
there’s a mom with two daughters
that pours some orange Fanta for them
and they throw blocks of ice
into the top of her swimsuit.
She shudders from the cold
and give small yells and say
half amused
“wait you are causing
my tits to hang out”
and the girls run laughing
circles around her
until one steps on a bee
and the yells
gets a new intensity.
