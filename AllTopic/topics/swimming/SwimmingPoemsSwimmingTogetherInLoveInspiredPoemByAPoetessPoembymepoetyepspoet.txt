Lovers who want to make successful lives
always compromise
I have since years gone by
always said Yes
never No
who am I to stop the freedom
of the one I love
even animals are blessed so
love each other when you flow
and
let go when charms don't glow
and both know
Very beautifully conveyed
love all day and night
him
you may
till life's last days
letwater flow in the rivers
of where live you may
and entwined
for life do stay
God Bless such lovers like you
always
