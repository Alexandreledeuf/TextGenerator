Tracks across the heavens, disappearing into clouds, no
vehicles driving upon them, only pictures in my mind.
Wanting to be up there, hanging from strings which are
embedded here and there within the sky.
Having to be content with sitting here on the ground,
still wishing to be above, playing in blue heavens and
swimming with the clouds.
