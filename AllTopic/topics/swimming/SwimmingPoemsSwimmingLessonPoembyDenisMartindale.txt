Some creatures learn to stand and walk,
Some learn to swim or fly,
Some creatures learn to sing and talk,
Yet rarely question why...
But swimming isn't easy, friends,
That's why some hesitate
And so, I guess, it all depends,
If water's what you hate...
The surface may look quite serene,
Who knows what's underneath?
No wonder some aren't really keen
When they come up to breathe...
Some creatures teach their young ones well,
To build their confidence,
While others simply want to yell,
As if that, too, makes sense...
While adults know their way around,
Their young ones aren't so wise,
They raise alarms at every sound,
Greet new things with surprise...
Swimming lessons should be sublime,
Not something you must force,
So, please, be patient! Give them time...
Let new things take their course...
