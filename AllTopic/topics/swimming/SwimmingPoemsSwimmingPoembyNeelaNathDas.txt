Swimming in the crystal water
Is a thing of joy,
There's the play of light
The tricks of the sun's ray
Like your love.
I love it but feel
Afraid as it may not help
Me float any time to
Get me drowned.
But, I can't leave this addiction
And can't stick to it.
Perhaps, I'll stay at the
Same state unless I
Leave this habit.
