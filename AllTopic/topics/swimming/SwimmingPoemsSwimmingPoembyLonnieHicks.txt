So soothing the warm hand
which poises, glides across
the eddies of my soul
and quiets the waters there.
Your Heart dips its oars
to my deepest depths
stirring my swimming-ness.
I open my mouth like the fish
and drink you in-
huge gulps.
I swirl inside the water-spout
and fall into the ocean-ness
where we both exist
in the quiet bliss
of our contentment.
Where in life does this ocean live-
it doesn't-it contains our life
yet itself is of an other existence.
We swim in it
grateful for the fins.
