My hopes are swimming
To search you dear God
In every direction I see
I realize the wonder more.
I know you favour me ever
You give without urging
Everything is ready here
Only I have to work to get.
Hopes swim here to connect
This vibrating mind tells
At least to get rays light
I swim in my thoughts daily.
I swim for you only in love
To get a bunch of affection
Hopes give me joy around
I remain happy with you.
