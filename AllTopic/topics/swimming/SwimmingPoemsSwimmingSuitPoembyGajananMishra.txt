I am in my swimming suit,
And I am in the water.
It is all water here,
Fear not.
You, yourself
Is the product of water.
No danger, come here.
We will stay here
Year after year.
Who is a perfect swimmer?
That I want to answer,
But nobody is ready to hear.
My poems are as easy as water,
You are my poem, dear.
