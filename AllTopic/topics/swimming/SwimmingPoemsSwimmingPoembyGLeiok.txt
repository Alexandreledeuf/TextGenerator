The sand between my toes gave my standing ground;
I waded in the warm and shallow waters, soft and calm as the currentless sea.
A sudden wave plunged me into unassuming depths,
The ice cold water crept up my spine like a twining branch of thorns.
A sounding horn awoke me to the sight of a faraway ship on the infinite ocean;
A red rusted ship, who's trail of shattered water told me it was all there was..
How strange the sight of a life preserve accompanying its path as i pulled back.
The shore had been swept from under my feet to a call of more immediate urgency..
As the shards of waves carried my stillness with it
Towards the flat edge of the Earth.
