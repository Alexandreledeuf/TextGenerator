Cold, blue water, shimmering and shining like broken ice
floating around with the morning breeze.
Many children learning how to swim, trying to follow
directions so they can move up to the next class which
is not too far from them in the pool.
Sitting in the morning-cooled sun, a gentle wind comes
along and freezes them.
Shivering on the side of the pool, shaking with the
breeze blowing on them, gladly jumping back into the
water when their instructor yells, 'Get back into the pool'.
