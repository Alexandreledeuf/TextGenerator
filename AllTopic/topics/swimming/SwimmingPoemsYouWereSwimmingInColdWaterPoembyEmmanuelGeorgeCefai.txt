‘You were swimming in cold water, ’
Said a Voice suddenly from
Behind the trees ‘and you are
Blue and that dangerously’
‘You are a goblin should I take
Advice of you? ’
‘Depends on you, free are you’
And disappeared
The goblin feet to back all
Suddenly
Then another Voice from a high
Bough tree
Said the same: ‘Beware! ’
Ended ‘the waters be enchanted’
And
I felt my red heart melting in me.
