Situating circumstances in lines of priority,
following protocols that are now non-existent,
because nothing is the way it's supposed to be.
Falling down in depths of self, swimming in
painful tears, not letting go of me.
Looking forward to edges of their pools, trying
to climb ashore and leave it all behind me once
and for all.
