A Swimmer swims one stroke at a time
Focusing all ones energy, on the finish line.
They try so hard, to keep up the pace
Eyes affixed only, on just winning the race.
God sees us swim as we stroke along
Through every prayer, we pray.
To start our mornings and end our nights
He wouldn’t have it any other way.
To focus on Heavens’ finish line
To walk the walk
Trying not to lag behind.
But if you do and seem to fall short
God is there for you
To help steer us back on course.
