Swimming for a healthy body
For a healthy mind
For a relaxation from problems
Swimming a beautiful experience.
To swim in the river
In the lake
Through the heavy flows
Skills to be learnt with care.
Swimming in the flood
That becomes more dangerous
In a river, overflowing water
Flood is having undercurrents.
To swim like a fish
Like a tortoise
More I liked in my childhood
But never could I achieve.
I have seen people drowned
Their corpse and the sad event
The family's hardships
Water where one must be careful.
An old man in my childhood
I have seen him swimming
In heavy flood and deep currents
Tied up empty coconuts his tool.
He was a strange and wonderful man
Having such an ability to swim
Whatever the depth and width of river
But he missed for ever
That too in such an accident he drowned.
