In my head, alcohol and its pall for callousness call
Emboldened by froth and wrath
In a show of gangrene gall in a mall
To distort my faith and misquote my oath.
Emboldened by froth and wrath
In an atmosphere teeming with terror
To distort my faith and misquote my oath
Anger sinks into a swimming pool of error.
In an atmosphere teeming with terror
Worsened by pomp and pretence
Anger sinks into a swimming pool of error
Snapping any semblance of competence.
Worsened by pomp and pretence
In a show of gangrene gall in a mall
Snapping any semblance of competence
In my head, alcohol and its pall for callousness call.
