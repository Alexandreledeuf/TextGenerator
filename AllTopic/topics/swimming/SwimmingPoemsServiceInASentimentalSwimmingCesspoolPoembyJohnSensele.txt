In Utopia, fools in swimming pools
Fall in and out of love
Because love belongs to bulls
Whose motivation is self satisfaction far above
Any sacrifice, any price, any advice
Given or driven by relationship advisers
Whose task in a mask or flask twice or thrice
Consists of coordinated commotion which Texan trousers
Regard without any potential placard
As fully fruitless because players
Draw damsel dividends and shoo away any simcard
They misuse to become heart slayers
Once a chance for a glance or dance is over
For a fool in wool to feel cool
That he has conquered a lover with a clover
Service in a sentimental swimming cesspool.
