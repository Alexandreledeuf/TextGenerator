We swam the lake in mid-November
For a silly, madcap, dare.
In the distance watched a figure.
With a look of, despair.
A man's grimacing eyes watched
Fishing on the far bank
As it happens my stepfather, crotched
Legged, looking point-blank.
Pole in hand; gazing above, the rod-tip.
30 minutes, swimming the lake
One-side, only, neither one enough equip?
We'd made a big mistake.
Sure enough his glances, like the water
We're deeper than, our despair.
Soon we'd have to walk back near naked nuder
Then if our underwear, were made of mohair!
But with my best friend walking by my side
I still felt unusually warm inside...
