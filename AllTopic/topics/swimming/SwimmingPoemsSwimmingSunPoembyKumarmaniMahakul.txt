Freshly risen sun has shown face,
Swimming this is in sky's chest,
Swimming this is in water's chest,
No rest, no rest, this is swimming,
Creating its mirror images in pond,
Empowering every moment of love,
With its golden crown and pearls,
Sun is swimming towards Earth,
Welcoming and embracing tightly,
The pond shore grass is smiling,
Beside the flyover, near the city,
Smiling sun's swimming is reflected,
Nature's bountiful moment is counted,
Beauty's glance is justified more,
Palace inside water has whispered,
Golden ducks are swimming in joy,
No rest, no rest, fest is celebrated,
Compassionate heart is empowered,
God's grace through sun has entered,
Mother Earth's bosom is filled in milk,
For suckling the baby golden ducks,
Green juice is prepared for sun by leaves,
After swimming more from dawn to dusk,
Sun will be tired near dusk to rest,
Dawn's nectar is ready to serve freshly,
Swimming sun is thinking to smile again.
