It is good to swim in seas
When we can be friendly with the sea
The salinity that made it
The sea ever a wonder with its tides
Swimming across the tides difficult
Where practice makes the man fit enough
Just like a circus artist in human pyramid
The art of swimming a wonderful lesson
Those to practice with care and caution
Just like the life that is to be faced
The challenges in real situations
To face them with brevity and decisions
Which like an expert swimmer in sea or river.
