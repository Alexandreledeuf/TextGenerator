The painting, Blind Swimming by Max Ernst, is in part his metaphorical
illustration of the process of creativity. We see a portion of a river with a very strong current, running from the top of the painting downward. An object or entity which is traveling with this currents moves swiftly and elegantly downward. Another object with a bullet-like shape is struggling and at the whim of the current. Yet anotherobject shaped like a blade of some kind is slicing its way upwards.
