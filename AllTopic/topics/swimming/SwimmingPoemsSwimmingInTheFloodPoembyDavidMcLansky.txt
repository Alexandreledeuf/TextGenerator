Oh Death I am a coward
You drink an old man’s blood
So ruthless in your power
You drown us in your flood.
You leave some lonely standing
Upon the shore of life;
My request (I’m not demanding)
Take me before my wife.
But to see her lonely weeping
O'er the shadow in my bier;
Oh Death I would curse heaven
In my agony, I fear.
