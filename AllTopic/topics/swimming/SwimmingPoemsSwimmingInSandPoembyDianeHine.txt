DRY
Noon's Saharan heat
sears the yellow fringe-toed sand skink.
Stinging simoom beats
sword dunes swept in serried bands.
Lizard's plunge is fleet,
swims beneath saltating tanned brink.
Sinusoidal whip's
subterranean dip.
WET
Should one chance to meet
supersaturated sand sinks,
Glide their surface sheets,
spread the body's weight, expand.
Stay unsettled feet,
float the span to countermand links.
Stirred suspensions grip,
skimmed solutions slip.
