I recollect the moment,
When my friends and I,
Would dive into the pond,
From the tree-branch high!
It was in my early days,
When earthly anxieties didn't touch us,
Like the free birds we were!
We would do things necessary and superfluous!
Once we let ourselves go in the pond,
We would enjoy each moment and beyond!
