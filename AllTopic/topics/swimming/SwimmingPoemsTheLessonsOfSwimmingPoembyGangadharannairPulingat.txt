Every one can't swim in a river
Which experience makes some to swim
The swimming a perfect exercise
Mind and body rejuvenating
Every one destined to swim
Across the ocean of life
Which experience makes them to cross
The currents and depth in the way
Every life is entitled to swim
The life that requires so much vision
Some may drown in ways of currents
Some victorious and triumphant
Everything depends the individual
And surroundings he got the training.
