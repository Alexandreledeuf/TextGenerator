After having their breakfast, roaming cats played together
Some cats sat to rest while others washed their snouts with their paws
BlackPearl strolled happily around my swimming pool
While nightlight shone on flowing water surface.
Suddenly, he put his walk to a pause
He stooped and stretched out one paw as he looked down on the water.
The clear pool water became more and more inviting
He decided to have a drink to fill his stomach.
While he bent to lower his head, he exposed his rear end
Zebra came running fast and pushed him very hard into the pool.
BlackPearl swam and got out of the pool as quickly as he could
He immediately attacked Zebra because he knew who pushed him in
Fearfully, Zebra jumped over the pool fence to escape
But BlackPearl chased him closely from behind by flying over the fence.
Then two cats disappeared behind bushes
But one could hear the screaming and fighting.
Zebra returned a while later in slow motion
His posture appeared as if he felt regretting.
He sat without meowing or playing
His half-opened eyes cast a distant gaze at the sky.

Above is the translation poem of the Vietnamese poem of NHIEN NGUYEN MD:
BLACKPEARL BỊ ĐẨY XUỐNG HỒ BƠI
Sau khi ăn sáng mèo chơi
Con nằm rửa mặt, con ngồi nghỉ ngơi
BlackPearl chơi dỡn quanh hồ
Đèn đêm rọi sáng, mặt hồ sóng lăn
Bỗng dưng nó tạm ngừng chân
Nó nhìn mặt nước, cúi đầu, với tay
Nước trong càng lúc van nài
BlackPearl quyết định phen này uống no
Trong khi đầu cúi chổng mông
Zebra chạy tới, đẩy luôn xuống hồ
BlackPearl bơi vội lên bờ
Biết ai thủ phạm, tấn công vội vàng
Zebra sợ qúa, nhẩy rào
PlackPearl chạy đuổi trổ tài phi thân
Thế rồi mèo khuất lùm cây
Nhưng nghe vọng lại cắn nhau mèo gào
Zebra trở lại hồi sau
Dáng buồn như thể ăn năn nhiều rồi
Nó ngồi chẳng nói chẳng chơi
Lim dim cặp mắt nhìn trời xa xôi.
