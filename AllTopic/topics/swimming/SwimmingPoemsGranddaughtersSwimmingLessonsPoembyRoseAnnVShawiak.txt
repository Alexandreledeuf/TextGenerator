Watching my Granddaughter at her swimming lessons,
she's just awesome!
Having learned how to swim when she was a year old,
now going off the low dive and the high dive.
No fear within her, just loving the adrenaline rush,
much like her Grandma does.
Now having competitions with other kids in swimming
lessons.
