Be patient in the heat strokes sweetheart,
There is a shy rose hidden in the thwart,
Get up throw the clothes wear a swimming suit,
Go to a swimming pool be a little more smart,
Clouds have started rising to watch your beauty,
They should, your body is a nature's work of art,
Soon they will calm down the hostile sun,
May be angry at the moment my great Lord Bart,
Love will calm down the prince of of the skies,
Cupid has stretched his bow just wait for the dart,
Thwarts will be pinned down the rose will dance,
With thunders and lightning it plays its part,
Soon the sun will runaway all praise to the clouds,
Its face is already pale if not full at least a quart,
At the pool I see violets, jasmines and daffodils,
In a green sari my South Asian rose what a sart!
The naughty rains have started, will not spare her,
You are exposed enough if not fully sweetheart.
I am missing something, yes I am missing something,
At a swimming pool I have lost my romantic heart.
