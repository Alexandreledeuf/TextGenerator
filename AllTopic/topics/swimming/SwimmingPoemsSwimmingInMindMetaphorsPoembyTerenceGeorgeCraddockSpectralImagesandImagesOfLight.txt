anyone for swim window sea diving
dive through house blue window frame
into ripple blue sea changes inviting
a lot of thoughts to hide in dive in
in a plus green personal library chair
among a sea of book thoughts unread
stairs to the sky stars universe beyond
start with inlaid luminous ceramic tiles
yin yang in black paua shell contrasts
