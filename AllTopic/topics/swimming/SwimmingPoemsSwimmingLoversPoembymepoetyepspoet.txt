Swim I Wish To
in summer not spring
in sea shores
nude as naked
we may be
I love the breeze
as it kisses me
thinking rosy cheeks are being kissed
by him
I am dim
my imagination pulls him
when can we swim?
in no bikinis
with only a smile
just lover tell me
would you love to swim with me?
