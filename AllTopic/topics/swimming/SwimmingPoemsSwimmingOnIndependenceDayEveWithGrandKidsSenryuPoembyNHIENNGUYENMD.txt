On this special Eve
I swim with my four grand kids
Under cloudy sky.
They have a good time
They enjoy talking while swimming
They race many times.
I swim on my back
So I can watch moonlit sky
And three-quarter-moon.
Silver lining clouds
Keep changing shapes and lines
Never look alike.
This is Summer time
Fire worms have dates on my yard
Frogs croak in Koi pond.
In fresh warm water
On Independence Day Eve
We have lots of fun.
