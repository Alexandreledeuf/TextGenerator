I went with them to the fishing hole,
Way back yonder in the back of the woods, .
Two girl's
without boyfriend's, they'd never even kissed.
Look at the lips of her mom,
Leaving with them, I asked her, with lips like
those, I wanna know where your taking me fishing.
He grinned and then said, Let's go fishing.
Each time it rains, it washes both holes out and
sometimes the fish are easier to see and catch.
