Swimming apples
I sat and he tried
-to tell me of the time
-when nature was nature
-and the hearts were kinder
"We lived there in village
-snow, farms and mountains
-and of course, big houses
-and rivers…"
-he spoke sweetly
-love his eyes when I see
-his past and family
-in his words floating, flying
Trace of home-sickness
-nostalgic with sadness
-missing past and anxious
-melancholy flavoured
"Uncle's house was called ‘Fort'
-castle-like with gardens
-of fruits, all varied
-a river in centre
-and guest house and cellars
-animals young and old…
-for milk, wool and mohair
-and meat, ride and porter…"
Everything that he said
-even talk and actions
-were sort of familiar
-seemed to be mine as well
- "Great were falls, autumns
-with the leaves gone, fallen
-and apples on trees…
-all set for breeze, wind…"
-and he was like a child
- "Danced trees to the boughs…forced apples to fall down
-and we were forbidden; had no right to catch them,
-the apples then swam in water of river…
-for neighbours and poorer…"
