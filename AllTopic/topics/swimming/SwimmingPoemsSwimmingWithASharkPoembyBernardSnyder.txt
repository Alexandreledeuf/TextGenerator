She tried to warn me
right from the start,
she said she had a friend
that had stolen her heart,
even though I was warned from the very beginning
I liked her so much I kept right on swimming,
I know winning her over would be tough to do
so, when she gave me an opening
I slipped right through,
Now that I'm in
the water seemed to have gotten deeper,
I'm not so sure
that she's a real keeper,
I think she swims along
plays her part,
but she can't 'feel'
because she doesn't have a heart,
I've even thought about backing off
so, maybe she could find
the soulmate she'd lost,
but I also know that she really needs me
and swimming away from her
isn't quite so easy,
but so often I ask myself
what role do I play
am I just another 'fish'
or am I standing in the way,
I hate being confused from one day to the next,
feels like I'm tangled up
in a fisherman's net,
a part of me would like to leave
and get out of the dark
but there's the other side
thats madly in love with the shark
