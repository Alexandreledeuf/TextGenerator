Are you swimming in a sea of tears?
Drenched in sorrow and clothed in fears?
Ocean of lifes deep regrets
that you have not forgiven self of yet?
Swim out to shore, step on earths green of sod
give your life over to the one true man
this man named God.
Drying off with Love, your salted tears
bringing new life, to live for years.
Salt of the earth, flesh of Adam's bone
Jesus came to earth did make short a home.
He tried to teach us all how to live
to Love and always of mankind forgive.
