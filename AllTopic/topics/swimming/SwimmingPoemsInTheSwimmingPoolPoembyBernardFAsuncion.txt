T-wentieth January morn
H-as made the day sunny;
E-vening shadows disappear,
A-s the dawn breaks early.
P-ouring rain Thursday
E-vades the Friday occasion
N-ew light is rising
A-bove the horizon.
R-emembering your birth
E-liminates the dark night;
D-elight is truly brought,
O-nce the sun denies the twilight.
N-o more mist and haze,
D-iving into the water is cool;
A-llow not yourself to sink, keep afloat in the swimming pool.
