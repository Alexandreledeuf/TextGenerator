Swimming against the current requires skill and practice;
If one is sent on a mission as representative of a novice,
It's like swimming on unknown water by saying something
Unknown to the inquirer who can't question anything further!
Knowing the situation, matter and forming an idea, one can
Deal with the new situation and return home by intelligence;
This is how a wise fellow can manage oneself against odd
Situation to the surprise of a novice who has sent one out!
A person of such an ability can survive anywhere in the world
Knowing unknown matter using general knowledge, presence of
Mind and common sense with the skill of some popular languages
To make all interesting by one's expression of matter new ever!
A poet is also a person of that calibre only as one cannot know
Till beginning of poem what one has to say and how one has to
Finish matter better for the interesting seeker of new knowledge
Until one has ended it well to the satisfaction of oneself and all!
