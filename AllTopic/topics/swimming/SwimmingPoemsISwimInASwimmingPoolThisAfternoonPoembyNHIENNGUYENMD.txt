I swim in a swimming pool, this afternoon
Of which, one half is in full sun, another one half in shade.
I have cut grass and trimmed bushes the whole day.
It's a very hot summer day and sweats soaked my clothes
Water is very clear and water ripples are so inviting.
With open arms, I jump in the pool and swim continuously
There is an oak forest behind the pool.
Spring season just ended but oak leaves are still dark green.
The sun is about one half way on western sky
Its golden rays horizontally shine on cloud dogs.
Under warm, blue afternoon sky
Sad cries of a mourning dove came from afar.

Above poem is translation poem of the Vietnamese poem of NHIEN NGUYEN MD:
CHIỀU NAY TÔI TẮM HỒ BƠI
Chiều nay tôi tắm hồ bơi
Nửa hồ đầy nắng, nửa hồ bóng râm.
Cả ngày cắt cỏ, tỉa cây
Mùa hè nóng nực, áo quần mồ hôi.
Nước trong, gợn sóng gọi mời
Giang tay tôi nhẩy, thế rồi tôi bơi.
Bên hồ có một rừng sồi
Mùa Xuân vừa hết, lá còn đậm xanh.
Mặt trời nghiêng nửa trời tây
Mây như vân cẩu nắng vàng hắt ngang.
Trời chiều, nắng ấm, vòm xanh
Tiếng buồn cu gọi từ xa vọng về.
