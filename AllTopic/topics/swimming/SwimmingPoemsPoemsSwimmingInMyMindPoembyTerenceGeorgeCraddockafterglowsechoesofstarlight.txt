woke this morning
with many poems
swimming in my mind
some were bragging
doing naked backstroke
up and down a pool
others were driving
swimming in a river
cool underwater moves
still others were body surfing
swimming at the beach in the sea
happy they would be, if remembered by me...
but sadly with no time
to write a line before rushing
off to work, they shall forever cease to be...
