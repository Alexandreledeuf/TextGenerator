I always believed
that the russian president
who achieved
so much in the present
would be a man
with huge intelligence
and a great human
making a difference,
but now I throw my hands in horror
and all my faith yields to sorrow
how can they build a nuclear reactor
swimming on a boat to the pole
and instead of being a protector
taking business as a destruction goal
why setting million lives in peril
just to get fossil fuels to use
where the waves might kill
by the natural abuse
what kind of weird driving element
in a money making hand
conclusion of this all
the brain is small
the greed is tall
