Quickly anticipating melodies and their liveliness
as they grab and take me with them into realms of
a musical reality.
Watching rivers flow past, mind swimming against
the tide, as it touches upon the harmony of life
and it's future.
Always watching, nothing interfering and all of
nature, human and otherwise, finds it's way in
exacting measures of musical interludes.
