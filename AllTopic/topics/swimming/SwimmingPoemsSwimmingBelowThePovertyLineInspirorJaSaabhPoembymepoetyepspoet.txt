You Sir in your silent desire
to become a millionaire
alas prove my point also
we are today much more poorer
than then, sixty years ago
when youth was happy with just 300
and
one could save a tenner every month
Today despite the high Pension
they give
they say
one has to sell
one's woman's bangles
once he gave her six decades ago
when they were newly married
This is the whole truth
poverty will for ever stay,
add on to more population
produce more kids
add on oldies like you and me
also one may
but we will jump over theBPL line
as we did jump
a 5 foot string
high jumping at 16
both you and me
our spouses could never have seen
they want earrings of diamonds
makes PLUME
laugh today
has the spouse's mind gone astray
One may wonder
we have become mindless
so we wander
