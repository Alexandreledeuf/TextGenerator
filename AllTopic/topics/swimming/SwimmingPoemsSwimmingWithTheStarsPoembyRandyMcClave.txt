I saw myself a lake of stars
As I walked past the lake last night
They reminded me of a thousand burning cigars
As they seemed near, and were so very bright,
I watched them as they shone and glimmered
Then out of curiosity I tossed a stone into the lake
And then the stars they all shook and shimmered
As then to the shore came their quake,
Stars of thousands I could easily see
And they all were inside this small lake
They brought me joy and also glee
That one moment in time I will never forsake,
Just think that all the stars that were in the sky
Were now in this one small body of water
And the moon as well, she was nearby
As the mother is always close to her daughter,
So into the lake I went in for a swim
I then swam with the moon and all the stars
I did it without thinking as it was just a whim
And while in the lake, I swam towards mars.
