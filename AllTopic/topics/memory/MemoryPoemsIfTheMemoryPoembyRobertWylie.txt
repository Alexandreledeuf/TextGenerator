If the memory I have of you
Were small enough to fill a thimble
I would fill a thimble,
And keep it in my sight.
But, since the memory I have of you
Is battle-size, I will fill a field
Big enough for armies, and
Listen to their noise.
Should the memory I have of you
Diminish, then, through all my years,
I will find, again, the thimble,
And keep it filled within my sight.
