As she lay dying with the radio playing softly in the background,
The notes of a song so sweet tickled and triggered her memory,
Number one in the charts the week she was born,
Playing at her eighteenth birthday party as she floated and swayed in a glorious dance,
The first dance with her first and only boyfriend was during this melody,
Playing at their wedding as a song they claimed ‘theirs’,
Playing its gentle coaxing notes as she made love with her husband on their wedding night,
Had danced and spun to it with her children, spinning them in her arms until all fell to the floor in a dizzy heap,
Now it plays softly in the background as her life slowly trickles away from her,
As she loses that once firm hold on a life so dear,
Triggering her memory to a life that would end with the last single note of a now bittersweet symphony.
