Petals torn from faded roses,
Memories stored in jars.
Photographs with different poses,
To worship from afar.
Love has gone from her heart,
Sadness fills his soul.
What of the vow to never part?
To live two lives, as a whole?
Emptiness fills the days,
Loneliness the nights.
Through teary eyes filled with haze,
She remembers all their fights.
What of the love they shared?
Could it be it's only hiding?
Or has it simply disappeared,
from lack of simple trying?
It seems a waste, an awful shame,
That love should part,
Just as it came...
With very little effort.
Let's raise a glass-
To the memory of love.
