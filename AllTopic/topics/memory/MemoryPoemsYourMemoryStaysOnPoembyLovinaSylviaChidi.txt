Your memory stays on
While you are long gone
A typical down to earth hero
As you look from up to down below
Stories of you will continue to grow and flow
Your memory stays on
They will remember you for your ups and downs
They will remember you for all the moments
You played a part and were around
Your memory stays on
You were a simple exceptional man
Making mistakes like any human
Your peak was when you took charge of football
Whilst your downfall was alcohol
The decider of your final call
Your memory stays on and will never run
Your achievement in football will always somehow return
We will miss you with each and every rising sun
