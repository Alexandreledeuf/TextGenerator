Listening to ' Beatles Sunday Morning'
Reminds me of a foggy London memory.......
Spent nine hours on a plane from JFK
Some years ago back in the 60's
Attempting to land in London
Fog so thick no way to get down
So up we go and circle, circle, circle 'round...
Still no visibility, so back we go
To Shannon, landing there to refuel;
Wanting to throw up - so queezy!
Sat on that plane for 2 hours eating Rolaids
But I do recall the beauty of the country
As we soared high above and circled 'round......
I vowed to return one day
When my stomach could handle the trip;
So here we go again, onward to England
This time the fog has lifted
And there on top of the buildings
Throngs of people are waving and shouting....
Certainly not for this American plane,
But for the Beatles  - on a plane
Coming down somewhere behind us!
What a thrill!  And here we are in London
Just in time for dinner -' on the house'
Thanks to the delay in reaching our destination.
That's the closest I'll ever get to 'royalty'
But still a memory I'll treasure forever.
