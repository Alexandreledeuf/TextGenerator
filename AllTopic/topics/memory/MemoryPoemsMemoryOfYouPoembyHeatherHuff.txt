you've been gone for quite some time
but the memory of you still lives on
it seems just like yesterday you left
my heart can still feel the pain
every birthday
every holiday
i wish i could spend with you
like the many years before
now i can only share these days with
the memory of your hugs
your voice
the memory of you
i still cry at night
as i think of the past
of all the memories we had
even the ones that were once so faint
they stand out more than ever
you've been gone for quite some time
but the memory of you still lives on
with me!
