Years ago, we came to the end of the line,
both went our separate ways,
but your memory keeps calling me back.
Calling to me from a distant shore,
back to your arms once more.
I try to resist and carry on,
but your memory keeps calling me back,
like some overplayed song.
I have a different life now,
the life we had is now over and gone.
Traces of our love they still remain,
but I cannot go back, I donâ€™t feel the same.
Each day it gets harder fighting the urge,
for your memory keeps calling me back,
saying with you is where I belong.
