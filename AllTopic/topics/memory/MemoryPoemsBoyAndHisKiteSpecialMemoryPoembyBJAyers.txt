High in the sky, like a bird in the air,
One lonely kite, soars peacefully there,
A child on the ground, with a string in  hand,
Pulling ever so slightly, to keep it from sand,
With every slight dip, he tugs the kite,
To keep it flying, to keep it in flight,
High in the sky, he watches with care,
A kite in the air, he tries to keep it there,
A dad watches silently, with pride in his face,
As his little boy tries, to keep it in place,
A memory in making, a time to share,
A time in life, with love and care.
