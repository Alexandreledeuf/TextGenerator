The very memory of your smile
The thoughts of seeing you again
Make each day worth while
Even as I feel the falling rain
Don't take my dreams away
Tell me, you'll come sometime
My hope lies on what you say
Promise me you'll come sometime
Don't make me wait forever baby
Or until my days of prime are done
I only wanna make you happy
In a world thatâ€™s yours and mine
What more can I say or write
Give me a chance to make it show
There's a flame that you ignite
It never dies though winds may blow
