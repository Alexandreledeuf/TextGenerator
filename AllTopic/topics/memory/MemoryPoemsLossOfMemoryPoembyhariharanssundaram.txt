I thank the loss of my memory
Of those days when I had not a friend
I am thankful to the memory
Of those great moments when we are together
I thank the loss of my memory
Of those seconds prior to your reasonableness
I am thankful to the memory
Of the great dimple when you smile
I thank the loss of my memory
Prior to the reduction of your anger
I am thankful to the memory
Of those great sharing moments of your success
I thank the loss of my memory
For the reasons of our arguments
I am thankful to the greatest
Moments of my life with you.
