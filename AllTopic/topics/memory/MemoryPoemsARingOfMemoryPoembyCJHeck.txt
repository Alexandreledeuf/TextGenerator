She found his ring
the other day
where she had put it
safe, away.
Like a key
its lock undone
the ring brought memories
one by one.
‘With this ring’
the preacher read,
promises given,
vows were said.
The time was short
to the ‘death do us’ part
and now his home
was in her heart.
A single tear fell
from her eye.
It always did that,
made her cry.
She kissed the ring,
tucked it back away
and locked up the memories.
No more today.
