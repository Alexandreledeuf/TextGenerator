I split the atoms
apart
(looking for the heart of the matter)
glued molecules together
to a precise piece of
Space and Time
(and hoped to God that God
didn’t mind) .
I sifted through
Eternity and Memory
and tried to create
just what it was
like to be
kissed by you
but I found I couldn’t
re - create
the tiniest touch
only emptiness and chaos
swam into view
and I remembered
that I had lost you
in a summer somewhere
beyond the power of love.
