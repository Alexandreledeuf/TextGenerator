Told myself today was gonna be the day
No more excuses~~I knew just what to say
Battin' my eyes, I know what to play
Ah damn, I let the moment slip away
Rackin' my brain~~goin' insane
Contemplatin' on how to let ya know
How it always goes
Losin' my nerve~~feels like I just got served!
Keep tellin' myself  I gotta find a way
Not gonna be afraid like yesterday
I'm so into you~~gotta find out if you are too
Heavy feelin' in my chest
Tryin' to represent my very best
You lookin' at me like I'm broken glass
Hands clampsed together behind your back,
Puzzled, somehow I gotta show you some real class...
Jaw drops, would ya look at that six pack!
I wanna aproach you, let you know how I feel
We had a thing once before
You haven't said one thing since I sat down on the shore
Here comes ya friend, askin' to rub me down
So I don't peel
You must not have approved
One simple glare and off he went with a snare
Finally you decide to take over
Impressing others of your ability to make me laugh
People always said we made a perfect pair!
The muzic plays our song
Instantly we both turn and look at each other
Smiles across our faces~~you offer me your hand
Brushing the sand off, you quickly took notice
My bikini was a thong!
Things went well, for the rest of the evenin'
Tomorrow I'll be back to rackin' my brain
Just gonna chill for now
Take it for what it is~~if it's still aloud.
~~~~~~~~~Ciao~~~~~~~~
