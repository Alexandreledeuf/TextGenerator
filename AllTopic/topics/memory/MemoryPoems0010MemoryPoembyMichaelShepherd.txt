and brought back with her
the first few primroses she did not pick
tucked neat into the hedgerow
a wisp of sheepwool
caught on wire she did not touch
a dewdro p which the sun caught as she passed
rabbits who lifted softbrush ears
paused then hopped away and yet not fast
a slight breeze which did not touch the primroses
which blew the wisp of sheepwool a little for a moment
which trembled the dewdro p into colours
and yet it stayed on the grass stalk
in the night
the primroses sheltered in her and grew imperceptibly
the sheepwool almost touched her
the dewdro p joined the air around her
the rabbits slept close to her
the breeze sighed and waited outside the window
in the morning they awoke together
