Like a shell on the beach...
My memory lingers on....
The waves carry them in...
The sand erodes their shape
The rain buries them low...
The sun shines them gold...
A stranger picks it up...
Seals it in his palm....
Throws it back into the sea
There in the depth of time..
.My memory lingers on.
