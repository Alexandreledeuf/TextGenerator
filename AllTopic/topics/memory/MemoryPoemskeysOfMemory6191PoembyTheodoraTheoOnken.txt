Memory
Plays the keys
Of my heart
Just like a Baby Grand
The melody-the tune
All off key
In an orchestra
Of fine tuned instruments
I follow the music
With my minds eye
To where-ever it leads me
And into the depths of Ballads
Of  'HeartBreak'
I, at last find myself
Locked-tethered-chained
To memories, bitter and sweet
Despairing and off key with no
Harmony, in the least
A re-write is in order, STAT
A re-play-a fine tuning, immediately
A re-awakening, a re-newing-NOW:
Of Hope
Of Hope That Sings
You know, that feeling, with wings
