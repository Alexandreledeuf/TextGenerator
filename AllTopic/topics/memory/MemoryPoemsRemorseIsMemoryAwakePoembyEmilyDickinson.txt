Remorse -  is Memory -  awake -
Her Parties all astir -
A Presence of Departed Acts -
At window -  and at Door -
Its Past -  set down before the Soul
And lighted with a Match -
Perusal -  to facilitate -
And help Belief to stretch -
Remorse is cureless -  the Disease
Not even God -  can heal -
For 'tis His institution -  and
The Adequate of Hell -
