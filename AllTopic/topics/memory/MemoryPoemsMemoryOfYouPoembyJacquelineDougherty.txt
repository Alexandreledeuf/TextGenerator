You are but a memory to my dear heart
that dwindles as each day passes me by.
My heart yearns for you, but you're not there,
only your memory is, and that hurts even more.
The tears are all too real and they follow the pain
my heart feels when it misses you so.
Memory upon memory floods the gates
and soon I begin to drown in them.
Each better than the last but all so sweet and real.
The memory is real but its fading too fast
its uncontrolable, and its evaporating
like dew drops in the sun.
I try to gather them up quickly, place them in a jar, but
the time is quicker than I, and it speeds up the sun's steal.
O I wish you could be here and not just your memory
because you are by far better than the thought of the past.
As each sunset brings forth a new day,
I think about the memory, and the pain it brings
is too immense but the tears are even bigger.
You are but a memory that is quickly fading
and only you can fix that my dear.
Though my heart hurts so much from the pain
only you can save me.
Like each sunset brings forth a new time,
this sunset will bring you to me.
And love back into the mourning heart
