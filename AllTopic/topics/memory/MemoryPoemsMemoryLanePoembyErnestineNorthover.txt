Do you ever hear a haunting refrain,
Which takes you back to that moment again,
When memories flow and scenes are set,
And you, once more, relive the time you met.
How perfect, were those days back then,
Those days of romance, and the instant, when
Love hit you with a painful jolt,
And exquisite pain, you didn't want to halt,
And playing along was a haunting refrain,
So let it now take you, down memory lane.
