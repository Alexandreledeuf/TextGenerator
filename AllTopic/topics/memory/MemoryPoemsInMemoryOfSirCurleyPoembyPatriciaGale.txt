Beautiful brown mixed with black and white
Eyes that sparkled with the call of going out into nature
Faithful and loyal, true friendship
A darken morning you went out the door
Passed your boundaries not a sound was heard
Helpless and injured
A single insensitive human act
Left me crying and you fighting for your life
How could they just drive away, leave you there?
You tried to fight but time had taken its toll
Younger days had graced your eyes
And the canine pup had seen eleven years pass
I held you in my arms as he said there’s no hope
As your final breath was drawn
We said goodbye and my heart will never be the same
We moved to the country for room to run
Now you run heaven’s golden streets
I lost my best friend from one act from an insensitive human
I took you home to your final resting place
Beside your favorite spot, the big red barn
Near the garden where we played
I wonder this house empty and void
A piece of me lays out back near the big red barn
And your picture remains on the fireplace
In memory of Sir Curley who died April 18,2007
My friend and companion for eleven years
The most loyal German Shepherd a woman could have
