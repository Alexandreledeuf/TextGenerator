I can almost see you from my window
the way you sauntered up to my door.
How you would always look at the mailbox
like you'd never been here before.
The visions of you surround me.
Your memory is still everywhere.
I wish you could talk with me now.
It's hard to accept you are there.
I see you smoking your cigarrettes
''No filters! ''... just as you like.
I go to the places you've travelled.
I see you where we loved to hike.
It's strange when I think of ''forever''
and know that you'll never return.
I wish things were not left unanswered.
I'm sure there is so much you've learned.
Your journey must have had a purpose.
You suffured like no one I've known.
I look forward to our reuniting.
Will it suprise you to see how I've grown?
Dedicated to my DAD
