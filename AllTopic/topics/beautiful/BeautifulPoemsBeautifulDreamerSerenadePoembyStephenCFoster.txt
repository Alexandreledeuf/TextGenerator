1     Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me,
2     Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee;
3     Sounds of the rude world heard in the day,
4     Lull'd by the moonlight have all pass'd a way!
5     Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song,
6     List while I woo thee with soft melody;
7     Gone are the cares of life's busy throng, --
8     Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
9     Beautiful dreamer awake unto me!
10   Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea
11   Mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelie;
12   Over the streamlet vapors are borne,
13   Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn.
14   Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart,
15   E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea;
16   Then will all clouds of sorrow depart, --
17   Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
18   Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
