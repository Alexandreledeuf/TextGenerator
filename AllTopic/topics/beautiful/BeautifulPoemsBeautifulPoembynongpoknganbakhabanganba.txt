Your so beautiful
Beautiful to me
Your so beautiful
God sent you here for me
How could I have known my love for you
Would grow into something so beautiful
My love to you I found
So sacred and so true
I promised all my love to only you
At night I pray weýll meet and always stay
And when I say ýi love youý
In a special way,
I wanna spend my life with only you
Your so beautiful
Beautiful to me
I just love the way you make me feel
I just wanna listen to the music
And think about your pretty smile
I just think about you and only you
Your so special to me
I just love you
Please, donýt you go nowhere
Your so beautiful
Beautiful to me
Your so beautiful
God sent you here for me
