Walk straight into the blissful arms
Of a new day,
Create an invigorating mindset
And devote your dreams
To an exquisite fate.
Be conscientious in following paths
Of illumination and self-realization:
Every moment is the death
Of a disappointing past
With the reassuring promise of rebirth.
Discover the immensity of your self-worth:
Unseen gods and goddesses
Are awaiting your arrival;
Deities in secret galaxies
Offer incense for your survival
And compose verses for your soulâ€™s protection.
