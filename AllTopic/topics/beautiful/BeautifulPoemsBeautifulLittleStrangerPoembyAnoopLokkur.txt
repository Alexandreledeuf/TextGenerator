As I walked down the steps,
my eyes caught your innocence.
The moisture on your lips
inviting to be kissed.
Your firm suple breast
could not make me rest;
And as you walked towards me
all I wanted was us to be alone.
As I see you bid farewell,
I wish to see you again.
But in my mind you shall remain forever
as my beautiful little stranger
