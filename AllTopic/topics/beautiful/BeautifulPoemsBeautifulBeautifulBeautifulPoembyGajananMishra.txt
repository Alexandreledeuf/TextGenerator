Really beautiful,
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful,
Nothing but beautiful.
Your eyes, Your hand-less hand,
Your presence, Your leg-less leg,
And Your doing all action
Without any presentation.
Really beautiful, and one who
Is not able to recognized You
Is really a fool and see
That fool himself is also beautiful.
