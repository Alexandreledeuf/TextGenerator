When you smile:
Your eyes shine so bright,
you get this grin on your face that could melt ice
your cheeks get rosy
you are a beautiful sight
When you laugh:
Your eyes get a sparkle in them
You get this grin on your face that
will make others laugh with you
Your entire body starts to shake
You are a beautiful sight
When you lay sleeping:
Your brows draw together
Your lips pucker up
You will tense up, then relax
You are so peaceful
You are a beautiful sight
When you are just you:
You have the most beautiful eyes
Your face is so express full
You make the person you are with relax
You are there for me always
You are a Beautitiful Person
