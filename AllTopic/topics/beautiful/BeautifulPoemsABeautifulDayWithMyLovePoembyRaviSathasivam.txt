When the sun rise in the morning
then you shine like a brighten lady
When the moon set in the evening
then you look like a beautiful lady
When I go to bed in the night
then you twinkle like stars
When the cool breeze touches me
then I take care of your love
When you are under my arms
then I tell you how much I love you
When I say my night prayers
then I thank God for giving you to me
When I close my eyes to sleep
then you rest your head on my chest
and listen to my heart beat says you are mine.
