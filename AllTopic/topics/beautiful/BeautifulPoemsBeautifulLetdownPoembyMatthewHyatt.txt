We loved eachother
Our hearts were warm
You loved me
I loved you back
But the sands of time
Made our love lack
I needed you
And hated you also
We screamed, we yelled
Our mutual hatred swelled
The day finally came
When you handed back your token
The emotion inside had finally woken
My spirit was broken
I became a shell
Wishing you would burn in hell
I wanted so bad to scream and yell
My mind has been set up after all
I swallow my demon, and then I fall
