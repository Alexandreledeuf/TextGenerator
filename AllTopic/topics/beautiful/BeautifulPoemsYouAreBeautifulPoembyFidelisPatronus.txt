You are beautiful
Your love shines right through me
Every time I hear your name
It makes my cheeks red with shame
You are beautiful
And I love you
Like I love music
But you much more boldly
How about you and I go down to the park?
It makes this love more mysterious and dark
You are beautiful
Your red lips make my cheeks red
Your flowing hair makes mine stand on end
Jealousy, envy, love, and lust
You cannot be more robust
You are beautiful
Now I have described it as best I can
I should be done talking to myself now
And I think I should talk to the beautiful stranger before me
Or maybe the beautiful you is not man but is this-
Poetry
Yes I believe I will go down to the park
So it is mysterious and dark
And write about you Poetry
For I realize that Poetry is far more beautiful than thee
