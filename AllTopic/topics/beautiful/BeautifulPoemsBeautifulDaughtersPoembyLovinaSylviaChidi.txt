Roll on, roll on, and stare!
Beautiful daughters of heaven
Three-sixty-five, Twenty-four-seven
Roll on, roll on, and beware!
Beautiful daughters of hell
With eyes of an angel
But beautiful daughters I praise thee
Praise be onto mothers that raise thee
For when a child is born a sweet girl
Heaven itself is raised from hell
Beautiful daughters are the seeds of peace
Their instinctive love we need not decrease
Bearing along the humane fruit of compassion
The golden qualities of a cherished companion
Beautiful daughters I praise thee
Praise be onto thy mothers that raise thee
