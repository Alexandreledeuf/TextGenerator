All my days before yesterday
Were for me just a joke…
My heart is bouncing inside me now
Like nice music of the type of rock…
I wish it can express itself
And frankly can wake up out of its shock…
I am afraid you become too proud of yourself
And hesitate telling me:
“I do like you also Doc”! ! !
