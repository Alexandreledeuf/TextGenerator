I suppose we start with Lipstick
Red, Cherrie, spread on nice and Thick
Then a hair piece, or a Wig
The best that they can Rig
Now we come to lots of Jewelry
Fake diamonds, rubies are Tom-Foolery
Or things hanging from there Ears
That look like Chandeliers
Also nail polish, perfume, fancy Soap
With all this stuff I don't know how they Cope
I really know that women are beautiful on any given Day
But no make-up, no fake-up, would be the best Way
