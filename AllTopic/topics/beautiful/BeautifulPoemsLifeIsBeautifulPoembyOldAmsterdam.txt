If you choose it, no one can get any...but lose a lot
When a flower was faded
You needn't to die
When the sun was down
You needn't to die
So why you want to choose another way to live?
You don't know that world is perfect or evil!
When you die
You can't see another beautiful flower in bloom
When you die
You can't see the red hot sun's out
Yes, you can't see it~because you die
No one wants to abandon you
And god loves you too
But  all of this
It's you abandon yourself
you thought that death can remove all of your pain.
But you don't understand
The biggest misery is live in beauty but you don't know it!
Before your mind controled by devil
Before you come to another world with 'Hello'
Think about
Life is beautiful
