Take the showers of April
The roses of June
The lazy sun of August
For an October honeymoon
Take the autumn leaves
Turning green to brown
The snows of winter
That will soon cover the ground
Take all these beauties
And the seven wonders of the world
Wrap them and tie them with a bow
So I can give them to my girl
She could shame any wonder
No doubt them all
For she is
The most beautiful wonder of all
