As real as air, earth and water
As real as a lovers fight
As real as teh laughter
Of a child in delight....
As real as the expanse of the sea
As real what lurks underneath
As real as the lovers glee
Of an unexpected rendevous....
Come and touch my heart
And make me real
Gaze into the depth of my soul
Make it sublime and surreal....
