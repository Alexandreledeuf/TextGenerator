Last night I dreamt of you
Continuing what we couldnt complete
Our salivas intermingling
Lips travelling from head to feet
Mmmm...whole body tingling
Bare on the sheet
Our souls singing....
You, the hunter
And I, the prey
And then
The prey becomes the hunter
Satiating our hunger
But the bodies are not enough
Our thirst goes deep
To dive into the soul
To make each other complete
Where its pure and divine
We dont feel the heat
Happy in our respective shrines
We are floating
amidst pristine white clouds
Thousands of angels
Come out and enshroud
Showering us with rose petals
And we are endowed
With their blessings.....
