You are like the mountain of ice
And am I the summer?
Thawing you from your stony guise
The water now trickling in the river
Is it the end of your long winter?
In anticipation, I quiver
Little by little
Inch by inch
You let me come in
Still a long journey ahead
For the river to join the ocean
We shall softly tread
Just enjoy the motion
Of the long ride
I just implore
To not to close yourself
We shall explore
The land of the elves
Laugh with me
Run with me
Dance with me
Explore with me
And
We shall run away with the key
To happiness
