Choose who will the wiser part—
I have held her heart to heart;
And have felt her heart-strings stirred,
And her soul’s still singing heard
For one golden-haloed hour
Of Love’s life the passion-flower.
So the world may roll or rest—
I have tasted of its best;
And shall laugh while I have breath
At thy dart and thee, O Death!
