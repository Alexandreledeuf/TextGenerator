Mirrored echoes dance, shades leave behind
Upward spiral, circle higher still.
Shadow personae played out, heart and will,
Inside and out reflect hopes redefined.
Can this light true remain or wane? We find
At last trace of shared space to dreams fulfill.
Now answer Dear, do you, too, warm and chill?
Depth of feeling freed, hearts need to bind,
Passion parallel, to urge aligned,
As one, - tendril touching - surging thrill,
Sensations soothing dissonance to still
Secret fears, time's sentence purged, demined.
In gentleness soul strokes soul til release
ON wings of comfort comes, whole makes each piece.
Ph[r]ase by ph[r]ase, souls tenderly tendril,
Answer questions. Sun beneath the skin
Sensations warms, blood pulses fast to win
Satisfaction which can Trust instill.
In gentless soul strokes twin soul until
Only smiles sleep comforts, kin find kin.
No dream is this, which daylight will wear thin!
At last trace of shared space may dreams fulfill.
Now must your answer show our overspill!
Depth of feeling, harmony, begin
Mirrored dance where darkness seems a sin.
Upwards two halves united spin - no chill
Shadow portends which could kill - love unshared.
I, Charmed, disarmed, am for your smile prepared
