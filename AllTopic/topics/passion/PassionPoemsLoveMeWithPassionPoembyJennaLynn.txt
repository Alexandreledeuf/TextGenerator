Love me to show how much you care
Love me to make others beware
Hold me all through the day and all through the night
Kiss me gently with your soft, beautiful lips
Kiss me while I embrace your hips
Comfort me when im feeling low
Comfort me when im all alone
Tell me you will always be mine
Tell me I am your sun shine
Show me how much you love me
Cause I love you too
with all my heart i belong to YOU! ! !
