When will the warmth of your cheek rest against mine?
When will the stream of kisses gush on my ravine?
When will your heartbeat rhyme with mine?
When will I stop writing these verses and become thine?
When will the fire of love envelop us and enshrine?
When will the winter suddenly get warm with our heat combined?
When will we be drunk on each other and not need any wine?
When will the moon become bewitched with our embrace divine?
