Swirling mysteries of my psyche
Come explore it with a tender hand
The essence is hidden in the bark of the tree
The sap is like nectar of the divine land
You have to enter untying your robes
Layer by layer revealing the core
Naked in all your majestic beauty
Our spirits entwining, together we soar
Oceans part, thousands new moons appear
With the energy of our combined kundalinis
Infinite flutes start playing music to the ears
Intoxicated, the beings start spinning
The sun will be eclipsed
With the sheer fire set ablaze
The dark sky will be illumined
The stars will twirl in a daze
Then my love, we will cease to be
Moving away towards infinity
Finally the doors will open for us
Our light shall always fluoresce
