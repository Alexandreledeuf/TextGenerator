When do you want our breaths to meet?
When do you want our souls to touch?
When do you want to feel the heat?
And make me drunk on our love?
When do you want our gazes to entwine?
And then taste each others sweetness?
When do you want our dreams to be love lined?
When do you want to surrender to this madness?
