I adore the landscape of your beautiful body,
as it is spread out b 4 me.
I'm nestled b'tween your thighs,
my nose tickles from your nest of curls.
Your wetness greets me,
your femnine liquid is sweat 2 my taste buds.
My tongue finds the warmth of your womanhood.
Your fragrance d'lite my nostrils.
My eyes travel up your stomach 2 the lustful curves of your breast.
Twin full peaks,
topped with harden nipples.
Signaling your arousal.
My tongue x'ploring b'tween your d'licate pink petals.
Small circles around your pink pearl,
with a flick of the tongue u purr n your unique way.
Telling me of your n'joyment,
I am unrelenting.
I feel your body tense,
as u grib the sheets.
Locked n passion as we were,
no one could tell u from me!
Bodies hot with heat,
erotic rhythm of your hips,
thrusting n time.
With the melody my tongue sings.
Time b'come a blur!
U pressed hard against my tongue,
I willing comply as I cup your hips,
as u cry out!
The landscape erupts with a fury of a oragasmic shock wave.
Which leaves u speechless from...
