Your passion is permanently etched on my soul,
On all flesh, branding skin north and south.
Even after I have finished brushing my teeth
I can relive your taste in my mouth.
Your poems play new chords on the strings of my heart,
The mark your smile leaves? I'm still guessing!
But the magical way you've touched me from the start
Poetry has no way of expressing.
Though it's true that we have never met in the flesh
And no photograph I've ever seen.
Could it be a connection from many past lives?
Just the thought of you makes my world green.
The best artist could never capture the beauty
Of the truth you have let my heart see,
Only one thing could possibly soften this blow:
To know that in fact - you are for me.
