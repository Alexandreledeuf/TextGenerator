What is passion?
Please explain..
Lest my heart be torn apart
What is passion?
Is it the giving or receiving?
The feeling or believing?
The newness or the trueness?
The ups the downs...
The aches...the pains...
Is it a whirlwind?
A merry-go-round?
A turbulent storm...
That comes before the calm?
Is it lasting?
Does it wane?
If it's lost...
Will it ever find it's home again?
What is passion?
Please explain...
Lest my heart be torn apart
