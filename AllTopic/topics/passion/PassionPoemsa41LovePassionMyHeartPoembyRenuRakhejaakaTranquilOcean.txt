Knocking the doors
Of my senses
My heart soars....
Urgent whispers, getting crisper
Beckoning, calling
My heart stirs...
Voices from past life?
Heart pierced by his knife
My heart cries....
Open the Door
Whats in store
My heart roars....
Oh God, whats that?
Bolt the doors
My heart combats....
I cant be yours
Let me be.
My heart implores....
In  peace
That my plea
My heart is on lease...
Lets open the gates
To our next lifetime
My heart waits...
