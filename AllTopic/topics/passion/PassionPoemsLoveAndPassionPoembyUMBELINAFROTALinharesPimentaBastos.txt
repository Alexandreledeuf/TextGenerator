Love is a breeze
of the dawn  caressing our skin,
Passion is a fire
which melts our heart.
Love is kindness
that touch and does not get aged,
Passion is a volcano
that blows up in eruption.
Love is a
lasting feeling,
Passion is a
transitory alienation.
Love is peace,
serenity,
complicity.
Passion is affliction,
suspicion,
desillusion.
Love is union
of two human beings
in communion,
Passion is conjunction
of bodies in ecstasy
and possession.
