Lets drink the wine of love...
Swirl it and soak it in...
Smell the fragrance
Mmm...and the scent of heaven
A song in our hearts
Smile in the eyes
Love to keep us fulfilled
For the rest of our lives...
Soar out to our dreams
Swim out from the streams
To join the ocean of love
And discover...
The world of paradise.
