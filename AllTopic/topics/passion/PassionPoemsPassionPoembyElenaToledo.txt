Passion does not have Culture's or
level's of studies passion comes
from the heart, how one sees life
from inside the soul, passion is like
a savage animal, that does not
understand or knows what he
feels; but has inside him the
passion that awakes his instinct
of savage love, Passion has nothing
but a soul and a desire to love.
