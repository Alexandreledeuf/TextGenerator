I wish you to unfold me
I wish you to hold me
I wish you to undress me
I wish you to bless me
I wish you to ravage me
I wish you to savage me
I wish you to blaze me
I wish you to daze me
I wish you to love me
Love me to death
I wish you to smother me
Smother me with your love
I wish you to inspire me
Inspire me to sing
Sing with you
Together
Where we can view
and feel
A garden of paradise
