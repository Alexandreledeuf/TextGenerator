I just want to keep looking at you
What have you done to me, baby?
Your smile quenches my inner thirst
The spark in your eye lights up my being
I feel alive
Like a germinating seed after a winter freeze
I feel light
Like a butterfly kissing the blushing blossoms
I feel beautiful
Like the full moon getting slowly uncovered
I feel complete
Like the parched earth after a thunderous rain
I am almost afraid to touch you
Lest my dream come to an end
