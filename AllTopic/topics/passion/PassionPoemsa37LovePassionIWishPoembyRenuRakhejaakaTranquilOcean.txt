I wish I was the morning wind
Gently brushing against your skin
I wish I was a ray of sunlight
Giving you warmth that would stay through the night
I wish I was a dropp of wine
That mingled in your blood making it my shrine
I wish I was the fragrance
In the garden of love where you were a prince
I wish I was the spring
In your life with blossoms spreading their wings
I wish I was your breath
Enervating you, keeping you alive
