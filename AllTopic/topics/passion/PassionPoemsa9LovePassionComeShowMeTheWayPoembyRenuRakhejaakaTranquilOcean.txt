Lost in the vortex of my thoughts
Seeking a vision that got lost
Fire consumed or a lost monsoon
Parched earth awaiting a boon
A solitary traveller in an undulating desert
that got lost....
Come show me the way
In your light, everything is clear
And its a sunny day
In your absence, its all dark and queer
All thoughts gone astray
Come show me the way
In your sound, everything is music to the ears
To which I dance and sway
In your absence, cacophony blares
All notes dark and gray
Come show me the way
In your touch, everything is pure
With a bright spark and a ray
In your absence, cannot endure
Even my own skin, t'is like clay
