She seductively sat
Upon my lap like a child,
Like a kindergartner
With proud innocent curls
On a sexy, na√Øve evening.
She placed her fingers on my lips,
She then pressed
Her whole hand
Against my chest,
She traveled south
And gave the slightest
Intoxicating touch
To my sensitive region.
We embraced
By soft October bridges
In the dark, romantic wine-glass night,
She told me not to speak,
Just to think wordless prayers.
And kiss her with unreserved passion.
