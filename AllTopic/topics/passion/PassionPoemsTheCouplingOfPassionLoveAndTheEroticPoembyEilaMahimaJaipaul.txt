Taking your hand
fingers touch my lips
I want to love every inch of you
taste every part of you
to drink your love
through your very pores
Lay down beside me
feel my body crying for you
I want to get lost...
your sweet caresses
touching my soul
Want me, like no other
need me, like air
join me to make one mind, one soul
fused in the heat of passion
existing in this moment
