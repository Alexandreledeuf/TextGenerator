Flames of raging lust,
thoughts of fiery dust,
sparkling kindled hearts
blazing in the dark.
Arms enfolding, holding tight,
bodies joining in the night,
hands soft and tender,
grasping, rending
flesh that lithely writhes
against their probing, sending
mind into ecstatic states;
to which you may relate.
Groaning, moaning
cries of joy,
crimson sounds
on pink rustled silk.
Penetrating shrieks
that thrill,
reaching down
to earth,
rising up so high,
and slowing
to a restful glow,
ambers of the heat
that flowed;
not anything
you don't already know
and most likely can relate.
