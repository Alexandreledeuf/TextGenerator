Passion
A red rose waiting to be given
A light touch on the arm
A cuddle close
A passionate kiss under the stars
A pen carefully handled to write a lover letter to a special person
A dance upon a dance floor before the sea
A slow walk upon the beach in the sunset
Passion
Existing in all of us, however deep
