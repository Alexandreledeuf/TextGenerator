Shivering with passion
Shivering with passion
As soon as his lips on mine
Lust creeps up my whole spine
His large hands playing on me
All inches of body aching for more
Keep up your powerful skill
Withdraw my resistance out
To make me without any will
Just panting for him
Shivering with passion
Total body compatibility
No other way of serenity
Let it be let lust overcome
Any hidden upcoming fear
Throw and shut it out of mind
This passion is burning me blind
his touching with such dexterity
Absolute tremendous sensuality
Shivering with passion
For the moment nothing counts
Than feeling his real desire
Taking my body as part of his
Demanding responding his way
Waves of pleasures splashing
Into my very internal caves
Nobody ever did it so right
Till his soft open lips aroused mine
Shivering with passion
When starting to wet within
Asking for more to be explored
Pit in my stomach vibrations
Tongues searching to restore
Lost sensible sensations
Stretching in wonderful ways
Whole of myself arching
In pain to absolute surrender
Shivering with passion
Only once in lifetime can one find
Such a total flesh connection
This thirst and hunger of mine
To renew the encounters
More and many more times
How will I ever have the strength
To leave this outbursting lovemaking
Once consumed behind
I shall always shiver with
A certain kind of passion
When in the future surfaces
sudden warm thoughts of that
love making of the past
