My beast has been awakened.
I shiver from its reverie.
My desire raised in a breath.
The beast hungers for you.
Candlelight flashes across your face.
Eyes intoxicated with lust.
I want you.
I can't think when you have been close.
Nothing is right.
Nothing is wrong.
Need overtakes me and I am a slave to it.
A slave to you.
My beast hungers.
Still.
