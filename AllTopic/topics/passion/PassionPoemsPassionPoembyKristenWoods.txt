It lies in all of us,
Sleeping,
Waiting
And though unwanted,
Unbidden
It will stir
Open its jaws and howl
It speaks to us, guides us
PASSION rules us all,
And we obey,
What other choice do we have?
PASSION is the source of our finest moments
The Joy of LOVE,
The Clarity of HATRED,
And the Ecstasy of GRIEF
It hurts sometimes,
More than we can bear
If we could live without PASSION maybe we'd know some kind of peace
But we would be hollow,
Empty rooms,
Meaningless lives,
Withiut PASSION we'd be truly,
