The greatest love of all
He, who had sacrificed
Endured the wounds and pain
Pardon for all our sins
Against the hands of the enemies
Shouldered the weight of humanity
Showering eternal glory
In this world ruled by evil
Overpouring mercy for our sins
No one at times noticed
Once there was a love...
Forever saving-love...
Covering us a mantle of His protection
He, who is the risen Lord...
Ressurected for the salvation of the world
In His love that we have forsaken
Sanctifying grace we have abandoned
Together now in spirit we commemorate...
THE PASSION OF CHRIST
