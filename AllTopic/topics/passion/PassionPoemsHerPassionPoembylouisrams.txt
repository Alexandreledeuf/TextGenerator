i see the passion in your eyes
i feel the warmth of your embrace
i see every curve and crevice
in the beauty of your face.
i've seen the passion in you rise
to a boiling point of no return
and the touch of you
to my skin burn.
in you is the beauty of the stars
and the depth of the universe
and at the same time
the emptiness of space
to capture you, a long frenzy race.
for your beauty is far beyond compare
and is something that i'm willing to share
Except for the love that i know is locked up inside.
for when this love is finally set free
you will hear all church bells ring.
this love will touch every mans soul
and the core of all their hearts
and pull up feelings which they
did not know could exist.
and turn their lives into 'heavenly bliss'.
this is the passion that you have within
and if not reached, a downright sin,
