Give me such Passion
That it knows no end
Let my heart grow wings
And take flight again
Allow me such love
That I feel with each embrace
Overwhelming fires
That grow with the thrill of chase
Grant me such a kiss
That my heart escapes my chest
Such a beating against my ribs
That my pain tolerance is at test
Bestow upon me such Passion
That nothing else exists
Warm me with your arms
Bless me with your lips
Touch me with such tenderness
That I cannot believe
That such Passion could exist
Inside someone like me
