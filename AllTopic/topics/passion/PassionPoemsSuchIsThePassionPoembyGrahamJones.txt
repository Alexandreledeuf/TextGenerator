Such is the passion the want of desire
To burn in the heart with fingers of fire
Wet lashes wrapped up, in a sweet velvet rose
To follow your heart where ever it goes
Such is the passion the heart strings to pull
That the cup runneth over, with emotions so full
To send you to heaven, the stars and above
To make senses reel in the sweet dance of love
Such is the passion in the depths of ones soul
Infuses ones mind and the dreams in the role
Of a lovers sweet kisses, to imprint its mark
Of secret assignations alone in the dark
Such is the passion the fire inside
Shines forth from the eyes, with nowhere to hide
Yet the heart and the mind, will tumble and fall
If signals mistaken, will then wither and stall.
