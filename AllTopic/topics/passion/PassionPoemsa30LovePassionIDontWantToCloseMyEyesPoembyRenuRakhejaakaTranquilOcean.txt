Today I dont want to close my eyes
My heart tells me that your image is going to fly
From the horizon of my heart to its beyond
I want to capture the image forever in the pond
A sacred reflection into which I can dip
When the sun is too strong and sip
its drops when i want to quench my thirst
When my throat is parched and I want to burst
Into a song.....
