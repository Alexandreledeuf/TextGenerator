Grand old Canyon Mars on Earth
Precursor to the rebirth
Of more scenic terrains of passion
We explore the umbilical union
Two souls embedded with escapism
Could we breathe the confined air?
Necessities surge but a test
You and I progressed
Love is paramount
As alive as Death Valley
I guess the rains down in here
Tormented and isolated…
The soils are red as our rigid hearts
The night skies were the curtain of Paradise…
Could we excel on no man’s land?
Far from over,
Pyramid and the Sphinx…
Proudest of the dessert
Great Wall of China…
A sign of loyalty
Taj Mahal love prowess
Leila and Majnun…
Love tragic
Dear…you’re manic!
What’s the significance of those?
Ain’t get enough of the trust?
Make no mistake
James Blunt singing ‘same mistake’
The song flows right to my heart
I treated your internal wounds
Like Oasis says ‘stop crying your heart out’
I lick your heartache spills
Like Bonnie Tyler says ‘it’s a heartache’
I will hammer Greenland’s iceberg
Nourishing your thirst for me
I will swim rough waters of Cape of Good Hope
Rescuing you from drowning
I will brave Siberian’s winter
Making an Igloo for us
I will befriend the lost tribes of Amazon
Telling them of our wedding day
The lighthouse of Newfoundland
Would welcome us as we ashore
Greetings from fauna and flora
Enchanting like morning dews dripping
Welcoming two soul mates
Dear…we’re manic
Love as deep as Black Hole
We float on the planetarium
Jupiter would smile and says ‘hello’
The moon says ‘bye bye I’d miss ya good fellow'
Milky ways shimmer as we journey through
Final escalation is yet to come
Beyond the spectrum
Heaven waits…
