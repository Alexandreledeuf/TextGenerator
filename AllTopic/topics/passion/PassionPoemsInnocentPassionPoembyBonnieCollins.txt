Your kiss was the first and everlasting
impression you had given me, that
I knew would last a lifetime
Through the innocence of our hearts
we were babes in arms, waltzing to
the soft music of love, dusted with a
touch of pasion glazed  with fire that
torched each of our souls
Its funny how time can surpass most
unpleasant memories, and at the same
time can capsulate the moments that
brought us to our peak of happiness,
but it yet has found a way to  remember
not to forget your soft burning lips sealing
my ageless desire of innocent pasion.....
