**
The play of passion
in her eyes is
not lost on him
Looking to see what
is not there and
wonders who is she
Searching through each
other and find nothing
yet taste every feeling
Seeing into each
other and suddenly
need to turn away
Soft kiss touches on
his cheek and he
knows nothing is lost,
Never to be found again
