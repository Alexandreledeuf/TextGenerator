A haunting melody
A lilting song
Invades my senses
Staying long
A whiff of your fragrance
Brought by the wind
Permeates my skin
Mingling within
Fleeting images forever
In the pond of my heart
Now I see your face
Staring at me stark
Are you for real
Or just a mirage?
Dreams dont come true
In life's collage
Let me dip and drown
In my own dream
Where you and I
Will fly and stream
