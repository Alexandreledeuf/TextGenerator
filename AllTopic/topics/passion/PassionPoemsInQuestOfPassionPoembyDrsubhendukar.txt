As  wish - all the best of love
that may  whisper you reveling
very depth of light yet unplumbed
enlightened with wisdom of love
as blue moon beams luminous
when its spirit rocks the earth
as we may muse and sway
in our own glory of living resonant
the very excellence of gift
in the harvest of moon in unison
in our verse and universe,
being led away yet by the light of love
as bestowed upon as in search
to the quest of passion afloat
as we traverse our time
to excel in the path to shine
holding the hands together
yet a rave review as rooming
a stance as  when as aspired
to keep the soul blazing unified
in all being safe and sheltered
