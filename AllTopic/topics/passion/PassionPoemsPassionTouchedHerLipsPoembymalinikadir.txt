PASSION TOUCHED HER LIPS
Passion touched her lips
Words flooded his sexuality
Unique his need sustained
His every need understood!
Understanding his umpteen change of moods
Her heart in true love…….
Can there be a paradise sweeter?
Than the desire for him in quest
Warrior home at last?
Today is captive
In the ocean of this whirlwind world
Tomorrow spreads its wings
Bringing hope in its tail end
The sweep of joy
Keeps you alive
“Present” presented to you
To cherish! !
Hope is the rope
That spurns the heart to action
Frozen camera
Perhaps stilled you to the present!
Taking the heart
On a flight
Where love grew
With each day’s passing!
Your love encased
Fragile I no more……..
