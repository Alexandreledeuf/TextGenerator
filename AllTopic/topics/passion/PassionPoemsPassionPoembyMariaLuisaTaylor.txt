Passion for the stars
Passion for the ocean
A moment of passion so easily shared,
With no fear o regret.
Passion is the eagerness to wake up with the light
A moment of passion I'll never forget
My passion found me
And what is my passion?
Passion and lust takes my mind
Passion the power to love,
The speed of passion: Furios
Passion is something you see
Passion its something you are.
