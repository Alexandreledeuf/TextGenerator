Love turns to empathy when one sees God in all,
The sharing of the self in life's rise and fall.
Fostered humbleness, blooms the empathy's flower,
And with it God's bliss, spontaneously showers.
While sympathy is Ego’s hubris,
Authority of superiority finds release
Empathy is a cry for other’s suffering,
Sharing oneness  with all human beings
Sympathy is worldly and mercy it may  trace,
Empathy sees itself in all living face.
