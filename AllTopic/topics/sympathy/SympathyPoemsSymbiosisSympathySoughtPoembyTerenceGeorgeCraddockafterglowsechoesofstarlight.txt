tempting manipulation habit
learned desired helplessness
corrodes player victim souls

compassion sympathy seekers
sought symbiosis learned
shell cast coping techniques
when tar trapped
in cannot control
horror situations
learned helplessness
is experience contracted
molasses binding mental state
organism was fear forced
to endure aversive stimuli
stimuli sizzles painful
unpleasant trauma terror
errodes suffering soul
victim becomes unable
unwilling to avoid
subsequent encounters
with stress inflicted
stimuli even if escapable
previous brutality taught
victim has trauma learned
it cannot control situations
