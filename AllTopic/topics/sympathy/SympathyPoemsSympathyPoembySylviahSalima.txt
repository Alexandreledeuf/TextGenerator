I am trying to say I love you but in my soul it; s not right;
I am trying to show you I care; but it never comes out right;
I am trying to make it work; even when I know its falling apart;
Am by you; because I know it is not fair;
Walking out of the door crosses my mind;
Never coming back is a done deal;
How could I: when my heart longs for you;
Making up my mind; is harder than it seems:
Am by you; because I know it is not fair;
Longing for another is what my heart does;
Wanting to be yours but my heart cant let go;
My heart tells me am greedy;
What has become of me;
Am by you; because I know it is not fair;
Our hands seem at a side line;
We are either together or falling apart;
I make you happy but my priorities are forgone like the dust;
How can sympathy blend into love;
Am by you; because I know it is not fair:
