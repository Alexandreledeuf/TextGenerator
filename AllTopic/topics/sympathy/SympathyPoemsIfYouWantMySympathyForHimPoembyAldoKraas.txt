If you want my sympathy for him
You won’t get it from me
He made my life hell at work
Why should I give my sympathy or respect for him if he doesn’t have any?
I am afraid that you must be dreaming?
I don’t miss that place
Two years ago it was paradise
And I was proud of this place
Not today anymore
Today it is hell
