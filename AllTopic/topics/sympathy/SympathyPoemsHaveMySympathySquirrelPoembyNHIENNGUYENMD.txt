Three days after the first snowfall of season
The air is calm, but lots of hanging clouds.
Snow falls, but just few scattered flakes.
The sun is half-hiding behind passing clouds.
A squirrel lies by roadside with exposed belly.
This squirrel was killed last night, while crossing the road.
Few years, I traveled this road, back and forth
Many times, I was afraid that this squirrel might be struck dead.
The other day, I pushed my car break to a sudden stop.
This squirrel was standing in the middle of the road,
Too scared, it ran in circle, not sure of where to escape.
It escaped its death because of its best luck.
Last night, this squirrel was struck.
I feel sad and miss you much
Have my sympathy, my dear squirrel.

Translation of Vietnamese poem Chia Buồn Sóc Ơi of NHIEN NGUYEN MD
CHIA BUỒN SÓC ƠI
Ba ngày sau tuyết đầu mùa
Trời thì yên gió, nhưng mà nhiều mây.
Tuyết rơi, bông trắng lưa thưa
Mặt trời e ấp, lang thang mây trời.
Sóc nằm ngửa bụng, tang thương
Sóc này bị chết, băng đường đêm qua.
Mấy năm, qua lại đường này
Nhiều lần, tôi sợ xe lăn sóc này.
Hôm nào, tôi thắng vội vàng
Giữa đường sóc đứng, hướng nào đi đây?
Ngỡ ngàng, sóc chạy vòng quanh
Sóc này thoát chết, nhờ may số trời.
Đêm qua, xe đụng, chết rồi
Ngậm ngùi thương tiếc, chia buồn sóc ơi.
