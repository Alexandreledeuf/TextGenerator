She's rubbing his shoulder
and he's reading about
Western birds. There's a scoop
of light just above my knee
it resembles the world, the one I know
a layer of smoke spread thin, a shelf
my mind returns again &
again to the picture
you gave me. In pain.
I'm holding the receiver
in Denver some woman making
human eyes at me from her
blue seat, but I later
conclude she's crazy
I'm helpless, rushing back to fix the
"h," how can I help you
I think we tried this long enough
our cure
we would save us from everybody
else, we "got" it,
us
and now we're another falling down car
complaining animal
empty house
you bleeding & expanding
until
the red night itself
is your endless disappointment
in me
who promised so much
on that hill
O Glory to everybody & everything
that we will fish again & again
& get lucky
