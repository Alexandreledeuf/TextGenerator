What's hell with everything that has ever happened
I'll keep stepping and stepping
to back
I only smell your perfume
And looked in the shadows of your eyes showing
Steps in any direction
I understand its true that made me compassion
Because you are beautiful universe
Because you have wanted to own
something I got
And to me thou fairest nymph
Among all the angel who dwells in heaven
When the night wind swept stars
It was just me, the moon and your shadow
I just do not care how crazy and be so
I sat in the meadow that extend
Slowly I fall down my body right
And I looked sharp and bright shining moon
There was a gnawing loneliness night song
My body feels lifted and flying
Towards the dark side of moon
I saw you dancing in the bright light of the moon
But like a dream that never real
I never reach your
And my body suddenly slammed hard
In the mountain hard and sharp coral
Only I get sick and wounded
Why did I formerly sympathy to you?
What could this something wrong with me?
