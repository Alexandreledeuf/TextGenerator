some times we hold on somebodies..
that we feel that we care more about them...
despite. that they only caused to us only a pains..
and we still long for them, in spite of that...
and miss them from time to time...
while they not deserve that yearning or this desire, , ,
even they not deserve this love which we hold inside our hearts for them..
