My condolences canâ€™t ease the pain,
That you have come to feel.
Nor fill the void in your heart,
That often seems unreal.
But it lets your heart know,
That you are in my prayers.
And when sorrow digs its heels,
There is someone here who cares.
I offer healing words of comfort,
And many hugs for sympathy.
When sorrowful clouds blotch your sky,
You can always depend on me.
