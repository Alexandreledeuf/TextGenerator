Save your sympathy for the poor living instead
Of wasting your tears and pity on the dead
Since they are past suffering and any living care
But the poor living in need of help are no longer rare
People are dying of malnutrition every day
And fleeing for their lives from war zones far away
They live in places surrounded by fear
And why weep for the dead when the dead do not hear
The poor every day life's survival battle have to face
Many of them are Stateless and without a Home-place
They are in need of compassion, kindness and empathy
And they surely could do with some sympathy
That the dead are past suffering i can only believe
And they do not hear you sobbing when for them you do grieve.
