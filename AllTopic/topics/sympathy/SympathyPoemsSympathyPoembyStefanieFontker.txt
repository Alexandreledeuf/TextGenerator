Oh, sweet Sympathy!
Show your bones
Where do you lay?
Save space for me
We'll be entangled
Internally, eternally
You are the gift
I will forever cherish!
For you offer more
Than simple desire
Treat me- I will take
Far more than I could
Ever deserve- Yet, ha!
Is it a sin?
To take what is given
Offered to me
On a silver platter
Nevertheless- Would I-
Could I- care to notice
The difference between
Right and wrong?
I have misplaced
My golden halo- cracked
I have forgotten
To search for it
Distracted by you
Oh Sympathy! Sleep!
Sleep with me
Come back to bed
