Irvan 12 April 1998
Stars illuminate the darkness that night my heart amazing
I still sit down and read the silence
Peel the skins memories that become embedded in spirit
And grain flavor that started accompanying the hearts of all the senses
I knew this trip would still be much longer
Although not as if I will survive
I will keep trying to survive and survive
To you my reason to survive
I do not care whatever happens between us
But I may know what you feel in your heart
When I walked away from you
My inner voice, screaming, mountain life abort
And I never sleep without kissing your shadow
As if longing urge you to come back again
Once inside, holy, eternal and sincere
I love you and will always continue to love you
How should I explain it to you
So simple but so hard to say
