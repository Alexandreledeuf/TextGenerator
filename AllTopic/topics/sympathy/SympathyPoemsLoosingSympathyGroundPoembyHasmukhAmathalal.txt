Losing sympathy ground
Sunday,18th August 2019
I may look harsh
but rush
to address the damage done
I regret it later even
don't go by my utterances
they are at once
spoken with a raging mind
and find no place elsewhere
I can't choose appropriate words
and use them to forward
my sentiments and feelings
I try to be honest as a good human being
I expect people to be lenient
kind and considerate at present
as I am losing the sympathy
and have lost the credible ground already
my heart reflects in the eyes
so try
and read the intention
that shall be helpful for the mutual relation
