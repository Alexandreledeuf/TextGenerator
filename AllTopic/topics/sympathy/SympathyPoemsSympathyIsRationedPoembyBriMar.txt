This intelligence you claim,
‘' Its unique to us ‘'
That's what you'd have others believe,
While you kill and maim,
Without any fuss,
I think it's yourselves you deceive.
The human being,
Is certainly unique,
But, not in the way you portray,
You're not all seeing,
Fact is, you're weak,
No-one believes what you say.
You live for now,
Forget what's ahead,
The future just doesn't apply,
Don't ask how,
The billions are fed,
You accept those starving should die.
You cannot restore,
What's forever gone,
By refusing to show all life respect,
When it's no more,
There's no new dawn,
The diversity of life you have wrecked.
If you're so clever,
Ask yourselves why,
The planet you live on is dying,
Each life you sever,
It's yourself you deny,
Yet death, you find so edifying.
As your end draws near,
What's left draw breath,
To watch you all die they're impassioned,
There's a lifting of fear,
As you meet with death,
For the human,
‘' Sympathy Is Rationed ‘'
