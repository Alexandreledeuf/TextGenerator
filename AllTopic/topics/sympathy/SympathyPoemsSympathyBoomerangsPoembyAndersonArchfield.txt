Despite what you may think
Those nice people, kind people, wouldn't-hurt-a-fly people
Are likely to leave you first
And you have a better chance with a conniving individual
Those crying people, lying people, I-would-rather-die people
Are often the best allies you'll ever have
Why is that you may ask.
Well those shy people are blind people, they unfortunately live a lie, those people
Switching sides, their sympathy will cling to your mistakes
And then there's the other kind
Those open-eyed people, wild people, not-afraid-to-speak-their-mind people
See the wreck of a world, and you, a star engraved in the bark
