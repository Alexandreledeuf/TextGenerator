A balloon of bursting tears cannot float
But do not provide the action
Or release the pain too quickly
You might not be able to heal the form
To stop the train of deconstruction
In time to save the shape assigned to this creation
A leaf of trembling fears
The blossom trying to survive
Tries to thrive
On the branch no longer alive
We are the branch
Donâ€™t think that you can make it without us
