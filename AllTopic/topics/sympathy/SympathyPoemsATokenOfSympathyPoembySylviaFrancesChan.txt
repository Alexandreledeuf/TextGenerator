MyNOTE:
This poem consists of four tercets and two quatrains.
Please, enjoy reading.
Thank you so much.
For someone i very sympathesize with
indeed differences like night and day,
is the best remedy for a happy marriage their way
i have come to a crystal clear summing up:
At the touch of love, we become a poet,
no matter the order of love
IF there be love, my zest
a newest poem is created in an eye wink
while winking my eye to the poetess.
An impressive result of your genuine love
first to the Lord above
then to your dearest ones and my zest
to read such mesmerizing poetry-link
a jewel from the tip of thy golden quill
and the deepest bottom of ink,
there's endless precious beauty still
with this careful created poetry
i offer thee a memorable reminiscence
hoping it's to your glee
and a welcome acceptance....
