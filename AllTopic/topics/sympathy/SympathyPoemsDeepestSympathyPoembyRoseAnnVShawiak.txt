Softened clouds of dismay are arranged
periodically in systems of disarray.
Lasting thoughts coalesce and brew many
new ideas of imagination.
All of them taking me into tunnels of
reminiscence and being remembered in times
of creative sadness as it caresses our hearts in
sorrow, holding us in deepest sympathy with our souls.
