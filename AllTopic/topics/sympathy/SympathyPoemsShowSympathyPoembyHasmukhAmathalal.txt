Show sympathy

It is God's grace
that you face
this cruel world
and yet remain in the main fold
Whether it is able body
Or with deformity
No one end's life
Even if it is full of strife
People take it as a challenge
And adjust to the growing age
Even though some people have born with no legs
They never lag behind
Some people have lost the hands
But life to them seems to be no end
I have seen the people working with legs
Writing, painting and even attaching the tags
Yes, society is also showing sympathy
They show empathy
And even rush to their help if needed
And show the gesture and they remain aided
