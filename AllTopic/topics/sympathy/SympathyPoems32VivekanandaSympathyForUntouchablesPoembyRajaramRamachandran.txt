At Rajputana, in a religious meet
Swamiji came to participate,
But none cared for his rest,
Or for his food at least.
A poor low caste man
Gave him with hesitation
Some uncooked food
As cooked one was prohibited.
As he was an untouchable,
The high class people,
Kept him at a distance
In all the functions.
Taking pity on him,
Swamiji then told him
“Bring your cooked food,
For me, it’s good.”
On seeing his kindness,
The poor man shed tears,
And gave him cooked meal,
That, in fact, tasted well
Swamiji felt, “The poor people
Who’re so good and simple,
Live in huts as untouchables.
And such people, we despise.”
For many days, with no food,
At some places, he remained.
He stayed then with sweepers
Who were treated as outcastes.
They were very simple,
As well as more humble,
And possessed many virtues
Of true spiritual values.
Many times, Swamiji wept.
“Why such men are kept
At the feet of our society
Without any kind of mercy? ”
For them, Swamiji prayed,
Wherever he had stayed,
For their speedy deliverance
From this unpardonable injustice.
