i am happy to see you flying
freely in the skies
like you are making a painting
with the wind
go, take time with the friendly pluffy
clouds
go, be aware of the colors and scent
of the waft- winds
wait, in a moment,
watch the bursting of the sun
the birth
of  a star- it is you
now
the center of this
universe
the apple
of my eyes
