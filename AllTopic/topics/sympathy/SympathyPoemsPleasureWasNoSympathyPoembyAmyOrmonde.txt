I was quiet in the corner
He whispered in my ear
'come closer'
I could feel something begin to race
My heart
as it began to swell and violently pace
He picked me up
then sat me down
on the edge of my bed
I began looking around
I was fearing at first
as to what we may do
and then he walked back into the room
His angelic face
pearing down at me
touching me gently
as though to swoo me
Hey laid me back
kissing softly
I could feel temptation
as my heart bethrough me
He began to arouse me gently
and softly
as though to know what it was I had wanted
as he caressed
I could feel the pleasure
all through me
watching in silence
he knew what to do to me
as slowly as we had began
our clothes where off
and we had sinned
he was watching in enjoyment
amazed by all his poise
and then he laid on top of me
and I began to moan
Pleasure was no sympathy
as I am glad at what he did to me
and i laid there in his arms
he said ' I love you'
and I was gone
