Some stay stuck in ruts.
Never able to pull themselves up and out.
Holding onto a stubbornness,
And expecting to be forgiven.
Or given the attention...
From those who have chosen to move on.
And this upsets,
The ones who feel neglected.
The ones who expect...
An empathy they wish to receive.
But do not get.
Since a sympathy is not given,
To the ones who self inflict themselves to bleed!
