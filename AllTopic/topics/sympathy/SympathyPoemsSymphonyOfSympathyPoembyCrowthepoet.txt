Where is the voice in my head
If any help it wants to be
now would be the best
These hands which flawlessly curse me
perform a symphony of sympathy
a one man orchestra of confusion and heartbreak
Where is this trust I've heard so much about
but can't seem to find
And to the world in which I stay
don't hate me when I say
'This identical state of mind
from the glass we look through
can you locate the hopes of the citizens
you erase
You know our names and our faces
but could you take one look at a blooming blue rose
straight in the eye and call it ugly
Could you look at a hummingbird
and ask for its wings to cease it's beat
We are the angels of this life
All we need is our wings
so could you help me find mine
the ones I lost some time ago
