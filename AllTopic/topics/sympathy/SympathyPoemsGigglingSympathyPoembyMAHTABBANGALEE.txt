Grey heron, on straw of boggy land,
Fry fishes are on swimming competition-
first, second, third…. to the jaw of routine
White clouds are flying by flapping wings
to the evening sky, the mill is ruling
to make new shooters
Falcons are wearing Black Shirts and judging
the sun under stormy darkness, no rains but
tears are shedding as blood on frontier thorns
The speeches on powered stage are honest friend
of nitroglycerin, sorbents, stabilizers….. no massacre;
but the space is the sparkling showcase of superpower!
-Gypsy
No!
-Refugee
No!
-Muslim
Oh! Shut down the life! Cleansing hut is my country
to make Heritage Park of civilization!
Stripped corpse of pregnant widow is floating on
naf river and going to shameless phallus of ocean!
Where are hoary civilized eyes for these seasons?
Mr. Civilized! Look- guest birds are flying as
your jolly fowler, it's your turn all; you can hunt
easily the flying by others with giggling sympathy! !
