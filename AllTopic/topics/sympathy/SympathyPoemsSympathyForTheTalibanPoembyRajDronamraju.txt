I've got marginal feelings about intelligent females
Show me one who hasn't grown an extra layer of hatred
Who doesn't justify decadence with libertarian reasoning
And will give someone average an honest chance
I made one-sided pleasant conversation to a girl once; she told me to get lost
I tried to express my feelings about women to America; they told me to shut up
I shopped around for a better culture in order to make friends
And found a few that offered up some opportunities
I fell in love with a girl
And she took control of me
This I did not mind
Until one day I woke up and felt something had passed me by
I fell in love with another girl
And she melded with me and we became a single celled organism
This I really liked
And I never felt the need to split into another shape
These other women and girls are full of first world problems
This does not compute, I'll go somewhere else
Where I can sort out my competing lonely thoughts
They'll threaten you with coherence for finally voicing your displeasure
The crowd disperses after the stoning
Someone will clean up the blood while others go back to work
The sound of religious verses hang like smog in the air
Sympathy for the Taliban
