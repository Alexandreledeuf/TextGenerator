Sympathy the good word,
Reflecting the kindness
Showing the love to suffering
Sympathy a great feeling
Coming from depth of mind
Showing sympathy a quality
Of persons the personality depends.
To show sympathy who we are
only we can offer our service
The service to the needy
Where ever someone requires
Sympathy the word have a pride
The pride of helping hand
The receiving end helplessness.
Only we are entitled the service
Those to the needy always
Sympathy and service must go together.
