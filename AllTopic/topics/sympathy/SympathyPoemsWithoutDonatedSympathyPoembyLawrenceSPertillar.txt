They are afraid to be discovered,
As imbeciles!
So to avoid this exposure...
Laws were amended.
Rules were changed!
Quotas were enforced
To keep those deranged in control!
And even though everyone pays the price,
For their lack of knowledge and skill...
Or guidance with advice!
Those who have been subjected,
To this effective neglect that has affected respect...
Stand on the sidelines
Forced to hear them whine,
About every aspect of their sorrows!
With or without donated sympathy.
Hoping tomorrow...
Care packages of 'insight'
Is dropped by the tons from the sky!
'Let's keep out fingers crossed! '
