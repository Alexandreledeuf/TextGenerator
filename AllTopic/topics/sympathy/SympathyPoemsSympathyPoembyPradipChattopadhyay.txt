In the darkly lit room
Hangs the smell of doom
As he babbles about his eyes
He seems bent on a mission
To paint a bleak vision
His elation isn’t disguised!
I’ve them aplenty
My eyes bloodied
In surgeon’s needles
Retinal detachment
Cataract
Glaucoma
There isn’t a trauma
My eyes haven’t suffered
His eyeballs roll
On the sclera
In perverse pleasure
I don’t mind
If I go blind,
The misery around
Doesn’t make eyesight a treasure
I haven’t met a man
To himself this inhuman
Treating the most valued lens
With such immense disdains
More than my suffering eyes
He says in glee undisguised
I suffer your cruelty,
That’s when you say
It’s my way
To garner sympathy!
