People depend on it,
they always run with it,
they always have to run with it,
they hope it would stop or slow down or run fast,
they always carry it with them,
they always look at it,
but...
it never stops for anyone,
it moves round and round in one direction,
it has three good friends in it who never fight,
the worlds depends on it...
THE CLOCK!
