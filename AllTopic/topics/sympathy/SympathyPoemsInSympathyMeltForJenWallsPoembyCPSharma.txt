She ever shines in God's grace
Knows no calumny towards any race
Her face with eternal peace glows
Love's fountain in her heart flows
In divinity she everyday dips
Prayer always sits on her lips
Sympathy in her looks
Charity in her outlook
In her ears Geeta, Gurbani and Bible ring
Her tongue the songs of wellbeing sing
Ever in blessedness her soul abounds
Her mind a rosary, love beads counts
Butter soft her heart, in sympathy melts
Jen Wallsâ€˜knees in prayer ever knelt
