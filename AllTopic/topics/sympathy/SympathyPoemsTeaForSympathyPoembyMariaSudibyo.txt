can you be able to love
without dream
can you be able to own
without understand
you will never take
you will never care
I'm only a name
you will never run
you will never look around
my shadow far from your heart
can you be able to care
but never reach
should I hate
to make you understand
without talk
without try
only emotion
you just say
can't get it right
just erase me here
can you be able to promise
but your heart's tired
can you be able to protect
without see me
I realize
I really know you
you only hide
you will never care
you will never understand
