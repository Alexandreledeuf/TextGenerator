Seems most of Americans are now using food stamps
maybe for the first time in their lives?
Our economy is hurting badly
people are going to extremes, just to stay alive!
Retail thefts are rising!
Better be home if a package is dropped off at your door!
Because when you get home from work one day
it might not be there anymore!
People cutting down Christmas trees
from their neighbors very back yards!
Times are tough, I've experienced it already!
but we haven't taken what wasn't ours!
I think they're are some going overboard!
It isn't that bad, not really just yet!
But wait awhile and I'm sure my friend
then where will be our Governments safety net?
They're all using our tax payers money!
For those who haven't or never have paid any!
But they're all in line, waiting for their checks!
while working off the sweat of us who work for pennies!
Instead of bailing the Auto Industry out!
Give all new tax payers, a new car purchased tax break!
This will solve the problem they say they're having!
and save them all from filing bankruptcy
or that mental section eight!
