Her closed eyes whispered to me
In that Cajun French accent
She had perfected; as her
Rose petal lips wet my appetite,
I devoured her each and every delicious breath.
My appetite, not to be denied
Was thirsty for more and more
“Baby, I’ve seen it all before” she said,
As I untied her halter and released
Her perfect breasts to my blind me
Of my prowess….
