All through my life I’ve been tooing and froing
Constantly coming and constantly going
This way and that way without even knowing
Trying so hard till fatigue started showing
When I was younger I worked day and night
Bright as a button and feeling alright
Slim as a rake but without a great height
Now slightly broader with trousers to tight
When I look back without being rude
Avoiding the mirrors when dressed in the nude
Exhausted from toil whilst my sleeps still elude
I think it was all down to endless junk food
