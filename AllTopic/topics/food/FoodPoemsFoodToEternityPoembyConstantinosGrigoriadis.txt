And you small human being who really will know that you were here?
After three generations you will be deleted from human memories.
Who will know that you have passed from the earth?
Time is the killer of all the memories
And the natur is your killer.
Don't try to understand. Try to give love and share.
Life is always bitter sweet get only what gives to you.
If you want more you will never be happy.
Your life is the beginning from your end.
Nature does not recognize you as personality,
You are a piece of the puzzle of life.
You are not all the puzzle.
Your mission is just to give life and food to eternity.
And the eternity is the reason that you exist.
