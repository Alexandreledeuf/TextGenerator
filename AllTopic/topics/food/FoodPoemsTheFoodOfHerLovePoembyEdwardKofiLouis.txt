She gave me the food of her love and,
It was like the crystal sea full of roses!
But i stood on the surface of the bronze sea to greet her,
For the gold of her love was like the beautiful butterflies!
Oh how sweet she was when i entered her,
For she remembered the words of her mother at last;
And the food of her love was fully prepared for me only.
