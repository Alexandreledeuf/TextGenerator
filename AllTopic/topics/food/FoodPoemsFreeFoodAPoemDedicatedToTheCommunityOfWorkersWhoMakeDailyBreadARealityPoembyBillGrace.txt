Free food I know it is a lie.
I can not kill that sign even though I want to.
Those who come for help will not be charged -
this much is true,
but the food is not free.
The driver and the truck
who bring it to the church,
they are not free.
The warehouse is not free.
The producers and distributors
who give it to us know
it is not free.
The church is not free.
Even Christ's great love
was not free.
Yes, the sign says: 'Free Food.'
It is clever marketing
probably even necessary
but I know it is not true.
There is at least two millenniums of cost.
