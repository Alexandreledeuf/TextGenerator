What an offensive brain
Tasking with junking the kids
Packed with deceiving zesty spices
Coated colourful with fattened salt and sugar..
Devoured the kids
In high spirits the packs romp and rollick
Eaten children lethargic
Resort to be hyped
Only junked in the packs hooked
Unaware of the sick-riding ghosts hidden
