Old habits die hard
We only live in present and don't look forward
Live with junk food and rotten ideas
All our advice fall on dear ears with no regard to pleas
We are prepared to live with all diseases
No matter even if life comes to stand still or ceases
We will follow new trend with hectic life and tension
Please donâ€™t advise us in matter with confusion
This is what new generation thinks!
Very shortly their life boat sinks
So much tension and no way out
This is life style and whole story about
Nothing is attained out of this habit
There is no strength left in feet
They crumble with little more weight
Only wait for instant result without fight
Nobody is willing to wait for a second
Even though some of the things may be beyond
We try with half willingness and less determination
It is not likely to grow any fruitful relation
Good food habits leads to culmination of good thoughts
Many successes are had without external help being sought
It calm downs the eagerness and stream into real strategy
The less time will be spent even after remaining so much busy
