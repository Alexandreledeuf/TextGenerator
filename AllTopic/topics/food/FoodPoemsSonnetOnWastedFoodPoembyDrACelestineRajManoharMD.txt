The rotten mangoes that I threw away
Are spotted by a crow by early dawn;
By beak, he tastes them, flying on his way
To tell his friends about the food this morn!
Most birds eat almost anything they get;
Yet, they must search for food all life each day;
They must do this before the sun can set;
‘God feeds them daily’ – that’s what people say!
In tons, food wasted can feed millions still;
The heart to feed the hungry is not there;
And wasted drugs can be of use to ill;
Is there not space for all on ground or air?
All earthlings ought to toil for food and drink;
Yet grains go down the drains; food down the sink!
