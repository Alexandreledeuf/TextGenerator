Give me some food
That provide and promote
My life vitality strength
Health happiness peace purity
Give me sweet and juicy
Give me ghee butter raisins
Give me some food
That I can eat drink lick and suck
O my dear, You are my best food
Without chanting your name
I can not live a moment
Come to me with food
And provide strength
To my heart and lungs
And with you I am cheerful.
