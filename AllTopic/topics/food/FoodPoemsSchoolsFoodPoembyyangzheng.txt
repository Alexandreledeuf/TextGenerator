Yuck! Gross! I won't eat that
this food looks like a run over rat
it’s green and gross, kind of icky,
it smells like a sewer and is really sticky.
Nasty meat cooked half-way through
I think my face is turning blue,
I think this soup is twelve years old.
The fries aren't fried, they're still cold!
We know the school isn’t rich,
But they can’t give us cold dish.
