As we graze upon reality
is there something we dont see
while I sit and take a glance
I wonder if its all by chance
do this life we guide from the helm
or is it set by another realm
can we change the path we take
or are we earthen bound like a lake
looking beyond this life I live
is there more I can take or give
I guess I, m searching for a gate
as I ponder upon my fate
is there something i can do
to make life better for me and you
so far nothing I have found
can unlock this chain that has us bound
I have grown old and weak
still the answer I have seek
is there something that I ought
or is it all just food for thought
