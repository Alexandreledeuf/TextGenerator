'Beauty was made from her eyes.
Soon they move, I fly into the skies.
Your charming eyes are my light.
When truely at night I lose my sight.
Without their lights the moon.
Would be darkish quite soon.
Wherever I see your  eyes.
My heart stops his soul cries.
When I stray and go away.
By your eyes I find my way.
Your eyes'beauty feeds all.
Nature, human still their soul'.
'With every motion of your lip.
My heartbeats, they will whip.
Watching them when in  touch.
Inner love grows, oh! so much'.
