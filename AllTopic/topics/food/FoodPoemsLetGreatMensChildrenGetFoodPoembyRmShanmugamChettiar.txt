There were great men by whom the society
Has immensely benefited and yet
It utterly failed to treat their descendants,
Who reeled in poverty and are forgotten.
To honour the great after their exit
Is not remembrance of their names
But helping of their ailing progeny.
Let his child get food before he gets fame.
