Twenty years ago a man lived in his car.
He did something that was really bizarre.
He ate canned dog food everyday.
He ate it because of the low price he had to pay.
He didn't have a job or a home.
He had no family, he was all alone.
I wish he could've afforded better food.
I hope that his life has improved.
