McKenna said; “They are the food of the gods”
“Has been so for 10,000 years, more or less
Consumed by shamans and a few demigods,
‘Til Laws made psilocybin illegal to possess”
It’s hard to profit from things we need not buy
For shrooms can be found growing in the wild
Alas, Feds cannot tax what grows in a cow pie!
For such a foul beginning...
It’s a wonder these unlikely fungi aren’t reviled
Some day, if you should stumble upon shrooms
Remember;
“The road to hell is paved with good intentions”
A “Good trip” can never be assumed,
You could fall short of unrealistic expectations
Mother Earth in her wisdom saw it fit,
To propagate her treasure in a plop of shit
