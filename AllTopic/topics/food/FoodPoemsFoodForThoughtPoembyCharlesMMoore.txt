They say in Egypt lived a man
who dined on cheese and pickled ham
and once he ate a caravan
including horse and camel
He ate all night and ate all day
and all the people ran away
fearing they would soon be pray
to masticating ecstasy
He went down to the market cross
consuming all he came across
and then when finished at a loss
he ate himself with apple sauce.
