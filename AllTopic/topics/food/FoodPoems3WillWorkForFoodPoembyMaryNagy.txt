I told my kids we'd see it, this movie, they couldn't wait.
We finally saved the money so we started on our ''date''.
They were so very happy to be on there way to see
this show that they'd been saving for even more than me.
Standing by the corner, he came into our view.
He looked so very helpless that I knew what we should do.
I tried to just look past him, to keep my spirits bright.
But, then I looked in the rearview mirror and knew what would be right.
The kids were looking also, they got quiet and so still.
My son's eyes looked so heavy as they simply began to fill.
He said ''Who needs a movie? There's good stuff on t.v.''
That's when I knew my kids would feel the pain of other's just like me.
As we gave this man the money, he looked me in the eye.
He blessed us all and watched us leave without saying goodbye.
His blessing was well worth it, I felt it in my soul.
I saw my kids' compassion shine and I've never felt so whole.
