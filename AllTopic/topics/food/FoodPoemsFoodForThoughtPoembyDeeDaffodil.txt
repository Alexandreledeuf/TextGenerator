If, on this night so dark and dreary
You find yourself depressed and weary
And contemplate the various ways
That you might end it all...
Please...DON’T!
For I have seen those left behind
Nearly lose their mind...
From grief!
And it’s not a pretty sight! !
They torment themselves...
With...
What could have been...
Who it should have been...
What they might have done...
Why they didn’t see...
How they could have stopped it
If they had only known...
And on and on it goes
They wake each day to the same routine
Of sorting out facts...
Trying to make sense...
Trying to be brave...
Trying to go on...
And on and on it goes...
And you thought that YOU were living in Hell! !
