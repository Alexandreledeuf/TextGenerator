I love chinese food, and chinese food loves me,
but in my imaginary land, i am the queen.
The clouds there are orange chicken, the grass is chow mein,
I love my land, mostly because there's no candy canes.
The mountains are huge potsickersand the trees are eggrolls,
whatever I'm craving it falls into a bowl.
It doesn't fall in big, it falls in small,
I'll tell you how small, as small as a golf ball.
It rains soy sauce, and the bushes are broccoli,
the beef is a part, and that part is it's berries.
Whenever  go there, it's always fun,
so next time I go, you should really come.
