In the year 2525
If man is still alive
If woman can survive
They may find; ........
That they were evolved into either Eloi or Morlocks,
But wait that occurs in 802,701 A.D., never mind;
But in the mean time, somewhere between now and then,
Human kind may find seeds that were frozen in time in a mountain,
A Doomsday Vault is lying within 650 miles from the North Pole in Norway.
It was built to withstand disaster natural and unnatural,
Earthquakes and nuclear exchanges,
and against Polar Bears,
But eat irradiated produce now,
whatâ€™s the big deal?
Having precooked veggies,
micro waved by fusion,
for your next meal?
4.5 million seeds are to be enclosed here,
From around the world to have some food in case disaster strikes,
Enough for Morlocks and enough for the Eloi,
But are they forgetting the bees?
You can grow plants but how do you get to pollinate them?
But we, in the present,
are banking on those in the future,
will solve this problem.
But today politically speaking,
at this moment,
there is (Condoleeza)  Rice in China.
