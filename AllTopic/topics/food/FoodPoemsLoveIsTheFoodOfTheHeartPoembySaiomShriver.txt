Love is the food of the heart.
The more it flows uncircumscribed
to all creation, the more the soul
realizes he must stop eating
once living beings.
When he turns to nonviolent food
his physical heart can gradually
heal releasing gradually the animal
fat, amyloid plaque, uric acid
and other accretions in the arteries.
