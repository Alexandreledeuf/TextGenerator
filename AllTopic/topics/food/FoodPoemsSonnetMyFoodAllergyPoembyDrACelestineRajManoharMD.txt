And now and then, I taste the foods I shouldn't;
So stupidly in utter  disregard;
The things I loved to eat, some now I couldn't;
My allergy too has made me a Bard.
The sufferings that follow are so great;
I take the drugs to combat Allergy;
Of course, the symptoms do promptly abate;
But side-effects do steal my energy;
1 wish I had avoided the mistake;
I canâ€™t be careful, all the time in life;
By miracle, if God-could only take,
Away the poison that adds to my strife.
Yet, blame I will myself for my sad plight;
How can a poison turn harmless o'er-night?
