It can't be said, that everyone, is a
lover of food. But I'm one of those
people, who can indulge, regardless
of my mood. Everything, that's put
before me, I'm eager to taste. With
me around, nothing will ever have
to go to waste. I don't like to
experiment, with dishes I'm not at
all familiar with, so I stick with what
I know. I'm really the perfect guest,
as I clean my plate, with gusto.
When it's time for the sweets, to
be put on the table, that's my down
fall. Whatever is made from chocolate,
I can devour, it all. I'm the perfect guest
to have, I have to say. So whenever
you want to invite me again, I hope
it's not too far away!
