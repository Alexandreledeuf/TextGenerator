Eyes do all that is needed
With due consideration point is conceded
But quest does not end in result
Sometimes hunger pushes more insult
I find horizon so log and vast
But happiness does not last
I have lot more to find
I can not afford to be kind
But what is happening?
Is it bad beginning?
I find no prey near the target
My eyes are tired but how to forget?
I shall fly higher
To get closer
To the object
And act
Some days prove futile
Yet efforts must go on for a while
I need to be more vigilant
And search them in plants
I shall go for search
And come down as such
Let me hope I succeed in the day
Find the delicious meal any way
