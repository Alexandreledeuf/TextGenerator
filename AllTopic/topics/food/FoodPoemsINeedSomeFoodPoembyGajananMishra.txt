I am in need of some food
After taking something
I will listen your love story.
I am in need of some food
After taking something
I will dance I will sing
O sun O moon O star O bird
For a moment stay there.
I am in need of some food
Food is the bare truth
If anythig is to love
Love food
Love is necessary for life
Food is necessary for
Life's maintenance.
I am in need of some food
Without food I can not
Do anything
There is no magic no power
Only there is hunger
Give me some food my dear
I love you then only
I can utter.
