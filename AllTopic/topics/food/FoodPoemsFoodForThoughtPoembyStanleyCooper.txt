Is it really so depraving
I like to eat a lot?
The thought of food I’m craving
Just ties me in a knot
THAT’S FOOD FOR THOUGHT
In time gone by, not in my day
Scholars taught the world was flat
For this they earned their scholars pay
And they believed in all of that!
THAT’S FOOD FOR THOUGHT
He thought he sailed the Indian Ocean
But found America by chance
Columbus had not the slightest notion
How great this happenstance
THAT’S FOOD FOR THOUGHT
There were prayers to many a deity
To fill the peoples needs
They prayed with reverent piety
In hope that Gods would heed
THAT’S FOOD FOR THOUGHT
Do we come from Adam’s rib
Or as Darwin claims from monkeys?
Can it be he was too glib
And perhaps a bit too funky?
THAT’S FOOD FOR THOUGHT
So many of our fellow man
We’ve often fought and killed
That started when the world began
And too much blood we’ve spilled
THAT’S FOOD FOR THOUGHT
