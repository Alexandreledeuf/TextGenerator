When we talked yesterday
your pain was so apparent
even though
you wouldn't say.
I could feel you
through my computer.
I could feel your pain
and your desire
for happiness.
I have faith in you
and if I could send my strength
acrossed the many miles
to help guide you
through the roads
that are bound to get rough
I would.
Prove everyone wrong
show them
that you have suffered
long enough
and that now
you will accept nothing
less than happiness.
We were born into pain
loneliness
and abuse.
Don't stay there.
You are so young still
and what a survivors story
you will have
when you overcome
all your obstacles
and create the life
you've never dared to dream!
