She always likes to annoy me
And says I am very sweet
She keeps giving me kisses
Which I don’t think is neat
We have these huge fights
Be the topic something real or a dream
Fiza hits me so hard
That I shout and scream
I think during one such fight
I broke a bone or two
My mom to stop us fighting
Yells at us both, that’s all she can do
She makes an angelic face
When my parents are around
But when we are fighting
She is the other way around
With that angelic face
She gets my parent’s affection
And even though I am innocent
I have to bear the imposition
Mom scares me out of my wits
Even though all she does is scold
If she scold me for the tiniest things
Before mom, I still can’t be bold
It’s a fact that we always fight
And she tries to eat my pizza
I still have to admit
I love my sister……….Fiza
