Sister Sister
My sister is funny
she likes to eat money
I can't wait till she goes to school
she might have a lot of work to do
I will have to teach her how to spell
I never want to be in hell
My Sister is a tease
She is always making me freeze
She is so great
I do believe in fate
I am only seven
But I know all about heaven
My sister is almost two
I will have to teach her to tie her shoes
My sister I love to death
She is sometimes a mess
My sister i will never forget
She needs to learn not to hit
SISTER SISTER
I love you so
Thank you for being my sister
I will miss you so
