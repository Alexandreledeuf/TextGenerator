My sister
She is my sister, not by blood
But rather by love
When i cry she wipes away the tears
When i hide she takes away my fears
Always and forever will i love my sister
Faithful and loyal she does remain
Protecting me from a world of despise
Listening to everyone of my cries
With arms wide open she nurtures me
and keeps away all that is wrong
She keeps me on track, never letting me stray
To my sugestions she will never say 'nay'
Thank you my sister for all that you have done
For without you all would be wrong
I love you my sister, with all my heart i do
The love for my sister is all true
