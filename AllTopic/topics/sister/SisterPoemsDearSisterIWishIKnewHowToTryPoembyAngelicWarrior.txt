You tell me that you need to know
how I truly feel
How can I possibly tell you that
when I don't even know whats real
Ever since I was a little child
I've been tough only to hide
All of my emotions
everything inside
You tell me you tried so damn hard
to help me break down my walls
But all I did was shield away
and build them up real tall
Inside I search for someone who really cares
the person that comes to mind is you
I feel alone
because you ask me 'you are, who? '
I gaev up on love and feelings
a long time ago
That is why my life is now
just a show
Sorry I say, sister mine
I want to give you everything left
But my voice has died
and you are deaf
I love you,
I want you to know
That if when I leave this world
I care for you deep inside, that's why I had to go.
Remember sis that the dream lives on
As bright as a star in the sky, you have always shone.
(to my sis....you probably will never read this....if you do...I love you...I always did....I'm sorry if i didn't show it....you where always the only one who cared...thank you for everything...<3)
