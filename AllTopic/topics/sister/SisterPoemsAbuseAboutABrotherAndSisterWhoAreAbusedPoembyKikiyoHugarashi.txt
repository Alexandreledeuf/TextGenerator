Abuse
He was little at the time,
She was only a child,
But both were abused,
And had been for a while.
Their father was cruel,
Mean and heartless.
The way he hurt them,
Made it look effortless.
He locked her up,
In a room up the stair.
And left the house drunk,
Leaving her there.
He was hit from the mum,
A blow to the face.
The way they were treated,
Was an utter disgrace.
He couldn't get up,
He couldn't fight back.
For food to get stronger,
Was something he lacked.
The little girl was left,
Alone in the dark.
Cradling her arm,
On which was a mark.
Her wrist had been used,
To put out a cigarette stump.
Buring through the skin,
Leaving her with a lump.
He had been kicked,
When he was down.
Kicked for just being there,
Kicked down to the ground.
She had been someone,
For her parents alone,
To personally hurt,
When they were at home.
These children were hurt,
Outside and in.
They'd been physically abused,
And hurt right within.
Their pride had been banished,
Long, long ago.
They couldn't stand up,
And simply say, 'No! '
The children died,
Not older than three.
The boy protecting his sister,
The girl clutching her teddy.
They had bruises,
Up and down their arms.
But they had escaped,
Escaped from further harm.
I wish that I could have,
Had the courage to speak.
To tell someone of this abuse,
That happened each week.
I could have made a difference,
For this little boy and girl,
I could have made a difference,
That they could mean the whole world.
So if you know of any,
Type of abuse.
Tell the helpline to today,
Before someones life is what we loose.
