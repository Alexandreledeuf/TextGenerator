In Memory of Audrey (wherever she may be)
I remember my sister;
For as the years past we grew.
Though our bodies changed,
Heartaches never do.
We could not accept the emotion,
Of hate that raged our souls,
Which had destroyed all our dreams,
And shattered all our goals.
I remember my sister;
The sobbing in the night,
A haunting string of memories,
That little ones can't fight.
The yelling and the screams,
Which echo in my mind,
Echoes of yesterday,
That I cannot leave behind.
I remember my sister,
The sadness in her voice,
Teardrops coming to surface,
Hidden in desperate choice.
Trying to hide it from others,
So no one could ever guess,
What happened in our house,
That we could not confess.
I remember my sister;
We were very young.
We would stay awake all night,
And await the rising of the sun,
For it was the only beauty,
In the ugliness of our world.
It was the only brightness,
For a scared little girl.
I remember my sister;
She was older than me,
Only by two years,
But that didn't matter to me.
The importance was escape,
From the prison of our life,
And the pain we had to live with-
The despair and the strife.
I remember my sister;
When the wind blows the trees...
We would watch out the window,
Leaves fall in the autumn breeze.
We'd try to dissolve into the loveliness,
That nature held unbound,
To taste the fruit of happiness,
A song without a sound.
I remember my sister;
The shelter I had with her near.
I knew she would protect me,
Whenever I would fear.
I saw something in her eyes,
A flicker of sweet hope,
That someday we would escape,
And somehow we would cope.
I remember my sister;
The night she said 'good-bye, '
To escape the walls of darkness,
Where children's dreams die.
I begged her not to leave me,
How could I bear it alone?
My tears reflected the sadness,
Which cut me to the bone.
I remember my sister;
The last words I heard her speak,
Like the tender song of a swallow,
Which had first discovered its beak.
She told me not to worry,
She would return for me very soon,
To hold on to the memories,
The darkness could not consume.
I remember my sister;
When she left me behind,
And skipped into the sunlight,
Which overwhelms my mind.
Many nights I think of her,
Wherever she may be,
A part of me skips with her,
As it will always be....
