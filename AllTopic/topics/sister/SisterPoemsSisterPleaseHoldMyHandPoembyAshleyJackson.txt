Sister, please hold my hand
As we journey through this land
Together we stand, together we will fall
No matter what, God will keep us together
That will be the best of all
Sister, please hold my hand
Because without you I can't stand
For we were put on this earth for a reason
To go through every good and bad season
Sister, please hold my hand
As our strength, together, builds each other to become strong
So that our love for each other will last long
