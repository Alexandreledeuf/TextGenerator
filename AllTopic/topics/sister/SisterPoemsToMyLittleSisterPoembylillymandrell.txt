Im sorry for all the mean things I said
Im sorry for ever time I yelled at you.
Im sorry for leaving the house when Im mad.
Im sorry for not being there for you.
You shuldent be the one thats sick.
If I could, Id take away all the pain.
All the Meds, and the Doctors visits.
If I had the choice, I would rather be sick.
You have all your life to live
And all the time left.
You dont deserve this
No one does.
To my little sister,
Im sorry
And
I love you.
