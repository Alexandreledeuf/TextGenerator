Sweet sister dear
Remember those years
We cried together,
Dropped many tears
Saw the fights,
Were afraid of lights,
The bottles lined up
And the pills in our sights
Now we are older
More lives at stake
Not just our own anymore
Our kids’ care we take
All the tears we have now
The powerless feelings grown
All the damage our family did
In our adulthood now shown
Please sister dear
Don’t cry anymore
I will dry your tears
As you have done with me before
Remember I love you and I am here
Remember with us as a pair there is no more fear.
