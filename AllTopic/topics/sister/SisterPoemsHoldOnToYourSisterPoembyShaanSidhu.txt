Hold on to your sister
She is a part of you.
Hold on to your sister
You can help each other through.
You say “You have No Sister”,
Then look around you friend.
Your sister is right beside you
Waiting to let you in.
Hold on to your sister.
Please don’t push her away.
One day you will look up,
And she will be gone the other way.
Hold on to your sister.
She hasn’t reached perfection yet.
She needs you to help her
To make it through each painful test.
Hold on to your dear sister.
There is something you each must do.
Intercede for one another.
This is required of you
