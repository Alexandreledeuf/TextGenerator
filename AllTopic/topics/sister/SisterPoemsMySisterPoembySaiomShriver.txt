My sister: helicopter
rescue carrier
floating in sea that others
may fly
My sister the mother bird
restrained
by nestlings
teaching them to
soar in the sky
My sister the lake
remaining in quarry
that thirsty babies
may come to drink
My sister the guru with eyes
so starry
carrying more weight that
others not sink.
My sister the last to leave the ship
making sure that all others are safe
My sister the Statue of Liberty
taking all weary all starving heart waifs
My sister the flower
who blooms where she's planted
that lonely bees may come to sup
My sister the gentle ear
which listens
and gives of her heart's
always full loving cup
