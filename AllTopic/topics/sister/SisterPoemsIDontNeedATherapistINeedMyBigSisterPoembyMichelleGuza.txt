I’m ever so numb
So why cant you see
That not only do I not but now I hate my family
You took what made me smile
Now I cry all the time not just once and a while
Know I am numb and can not feel
Please tell me what is the deal
You have to learn to trust the girl that you raised
Just let us be friends and you will be amazed
Amazed to see the smile brake away that frozen frown
its not like ill be a stripper in town
I use to tell you everything and anything
Now I just wait for the phone to ring
We use to be so close not to mention
But now at dinner you can just feel the tension
Daddy just understand that with out you I can live
You have given all the help you can give
You have taken my light and burned it out
You have taken my heart and made it cold
You have taken my sister and hurt me so
I cant talk to you with out being judged
But now I can see that you decision can not be budged
If I could I would walk till my feet were nothing but a blister
Dad.. I don’t need a therapist I need my big sister! !
