She was always  up early before sunrise
Prepared her teaching kit  and some provision
To catch an early ride is a prize
And to be with her students was her great mission
Happily  she gave all her earnings  to our mother
She have to save enough, no parties, no boyfriend
Oh, she loves us very much, she was a dear
She is a sister, a loving daughter, she is a friend
She loves to dance and  sing at her heart's content
Even in the wee hours, we're on top of the world
I missed her every now and then
And my love for her that was  never told
To a far away place she went
Life then was not easy to keep afloat each day
And so all her earnings she sent
And saved enough for rainy day.
Her loving arms always gives me the strength
Whenever i have struggle and pain
To be down on my knees and at length
And take up the Cross, be yourself  again
I cannot hold her hands and hug her forever
God had taken her to her permanent home in heaven
But her beautiful memories will always linger
In my mind.. in my heart, she was a heaven sent
My special tribute to my sister Lyn
