Your radiant smile brought sunshine in my life
your thoughtfulness exceeded all expectations
I am lost without you like the babes in the forest
Theres nothing on earth that can compare
With the sisterly love that we both shared
you are gone but not forgotten
We played with our toys in the attic on cold winter days
Made up stories of ghosts and gobims and things that go bump in the night
It was all so fine and grand
We frolic and played and had such fun
Shared sectrets of the very young
I can still hear Tell laura I love her, Moody rivers,
The words  echoing through my mind
Bringing back sweet memories of you
All my fears went out of site
As you sang me to sleep at night
We both grew up and had families of our own
You were never out ot off reach
Aways there though thick and thin
One couldn, t ask for a better friend
When I needed someone to talk too
I would call you on the phone
The phone lays there in silence
For the angels has taken you home
You were my inspiraion
Steady like a rock
Dependable in every way
You had a roar of a lion
A heart of gold
you were protective  over me
Like an eagle in flight
Swooping down on her prey
To make all the pain go away
Her enemies feard and trembled
Then she flew away
How can I survive this world without you
You said I would never be alone
That you would be looking down on me
Why do tears of sorrow fill my eyes
Why do I have a heavy heart
The butterfly pendnant you gave me
With a heart that says I love you
Stares at me every day
With an over whelming sadness
That you have gone away
You were very brave through all the pain
Thought only of others right to the end
Accepted things as they were where I could not
My sister, I miss you in every way
Life will never be the same
Time will never heal my wounds
I think of you every passing day

Your radiant smile brought sunshine in my life
Your thoughtfuless exceeded all exspectations
I am lost without you like the babes in the forest
There, s nothinng compared to the sisterly love that we shared
You are gone but not forgotten
We played with our toys in the attic on cold winter days
Made up stories of ghosts and goblins, things that go bump in the night
It was all so fine and grand
We frolic and played and had such fun
Shared secrets of the very young
I can still hear  Tell Laura I  Love her, Moody rivers
The words echoing through my mind

Why do tears twinkle from my eye
Why do I  have a heavy heart
Please God give me strenth
The butterfly pendant you gave me
With a heart that says I love you
