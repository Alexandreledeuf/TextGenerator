There is a wise lady
Who inspires my life.
This sweet woman
Is my uncles wife.
She has always been there
Through thick and thin.
She has never let me down
Even when things were dim.
She holds the key
That goes to my heart.
No one else can get through,
The walls just wont part.
No one else will ever know
Exactly how I feel,
But this wonderful lady
Has shown me best friends are real.
She knows everything about me,
Both inside and out.
Whenever I need her,
I only need to shout.
