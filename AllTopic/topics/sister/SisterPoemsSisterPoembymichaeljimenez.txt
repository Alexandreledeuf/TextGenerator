Sister my dear sister I wish that I could see you everyday,
so you can tell me your not alone and heaven is okay,
I need something to help me carry on,
cause I cant except the fact that your gone,
trying to hide the tears,
because of my pride eventhough I'm dying inside,
deep in my soul a sorrow haunted by every tommorrow,
cause your not there waiting,
its not fair my heart is fading,
all I should of said will never be,
never got to say what you meant to me,
or to our whole family,
so sister my dear sister I'll start living a better way,
so you can welcome me home someday.
