To my sister Julia, who will do great things...
We never had planned this
We never tried.
You're a siter, my sister,
And I still ask why.
All the fighting and noise
And pulling hair;
You're a sister, my sister,
And it's just not fair.
We're sisters, and sometimes
I regret it.
Yet because of you, I'll
Never forget it!
BUT...
Through our ups and downs
This much is true:
You're a sister, my sister,
And I still love you.
