I can no longer tell people that I have a little sister,
Now I must say that I have a younger sister,
Because you’re old enough to no longer be a ‘little sister’,
Though to be honest, that’s what you’ll always be to me.
This is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to write,
Because there are no words of wisdom that I can give you
That you probably don’t already know,
The only advice I could impart is just to stay crazy.
I know that soon I’ll be going away and things may not be the same,
But I’ll always remember you like you are from this past year.
My sister- the strong, independent girl who takes no rubbish off anyone,
Listens to Elaine Page and the Sex Pistols, quotes Monty Python as if it were verse
And uses her eyebrows as dangerous weapons.
What I just want you to know, no matter how old or young you are,
Just how much your brother loves you dearly,
Even though you’re no longer old enough to be my little sister anymore.
