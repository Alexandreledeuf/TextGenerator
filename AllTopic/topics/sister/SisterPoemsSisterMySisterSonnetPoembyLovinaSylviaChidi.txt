Sister, my sister
I wish you were I said too carelessly
As I gazed into her face tanned so flawlessly
Now that’s a tongue twister said the minister
A sister can give you a life full of painful blisters
And so I looked at her thoughtlessly
My spirit was high with hope restlessly
And I replied, “But sister my sister so can a geezer”
She held my hand and laughed and cried
A friend can be stronger than blood
And what we have is a far greater treasure
But when I stared at her I knew she lied
A sister is a treasure no one can measure
But no one can love you more than God
