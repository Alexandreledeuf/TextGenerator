As I listen to that guitar scream
Sounds ring out my destiny
A stronger power grabs ahold of me
Shocks me with a volt of electricity
My intestance explodes onto the floor
Red blood begins to shadow my mind
Extacy brings out a whore
Her shattered innocence has made her blind
Dont cry little sister
I can feel your need
Youre not to blame for your indecency
Dont cry little sister
Its not your fault
That the demons within have tore your soul apart
Ill always love ya little sister
Youve done no wrong
Although the demons reach out to kiss ya
Never feel you dont belong
