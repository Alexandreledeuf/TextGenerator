The anticipation grows each day
To see my little sister appear and say
Carolyn I love you so
Thankyou for being the sister I know
I talk some days to my mums tiny bump
And see this huge explosive thump
Is this my sister already talking to me?
i really hope so I guess ill soon see
all the love and care inside
builds each day it can not hide
it is all made for this one little girl
my first sister to be my mums little pearl
in a few weeks ill no longer be
this “only child”, its no longer just me
this is definitely not a bad thing
I already love my unborn sibling
When she appears we will all celebrate
Me, mum and Jase we really cant wait
To see her little face awaken  and shine
This really will be a happy time
So to you my little unborn sibling
After 17 years I now know what I have been missing
A little sister to love and hold near
And that baby girl is you my dear
