The ocean breeze with it's special aroma permeated the air.
I felt lonely, empty, my sister's ashes now flow there.
In my mind's eye, I saw her face and beautiful golden hair.
Oh how I wish she was also standing here.
I feel somewhat at peace, though I miss her so very much,
longing to once more feel her warm gentle touch.
In my heart, I know she is surely gone,
but in her children's faces, my beautiful sister lives on.
