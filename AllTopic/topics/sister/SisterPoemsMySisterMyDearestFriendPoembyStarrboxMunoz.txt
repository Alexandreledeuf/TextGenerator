You're the best sister I could have asked for
I pray thanks to god, that he gave you to me
We laugh together, and we cry together
We play and we fight
But in the end it's all alright
Your my sisterly companion, my partner in crime
You're my trustee confidant
We keep each others deepest secrets safe
And even though we're cousins by law & blood
We're sisters at heart, which is where it counts =]
Simply because you're my sister and you're my friend
Thank you so much for being the best sister I could EVER have!
