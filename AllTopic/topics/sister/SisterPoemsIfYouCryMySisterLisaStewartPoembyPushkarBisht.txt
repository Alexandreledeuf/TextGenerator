If you cry my sister,
I am always there to wipe out
Your tickling tears
For swallowing them in me
You are the dearest one,
Don’t think
You are alone in this world
Your brother is still alive for you
Remember me,
The moment you undergo,
The toughest circumstance of your life
Believe me, Sister
Your brother will sacrifice his life
For your sake
Oh Sister,
Don’t take the test of your brother
If really you face problems
That shatter all your hope and sweet memories,
Then close your eyes, you will feel brother near you
