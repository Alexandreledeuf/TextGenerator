*Poem*
As I think about it more and more each day, it comes clearer to me.
What I feel in my heart is no lie.
It is all real.
Back in the day we didn't get along that well.
Most of the time we did nothing but fight.
Day after day there were sheded tears and sometimes sheded blood.
I know that you never meant to hurt me.
I never meant to hurt you.
Everything got crazy right quick as I got in high school.
No matter what I did you were right there.
You took me in under your wing and loved me.
We had our share of pain.
I have and always will look up to you as a second mother.
I am sorry for everything that I have done that caused you pain.
Thanks for being my bestfriend.
I would never ask God for another sister.
No one can or will ever take the sister bond that we have.
Thank you for the two beautiful Angels that you brought in to this world.
I never regret God letting me be the luckiest lil sister in the world, by having you as a big sister.
You are and forever will be my hero, my sister, my bestfriend, and my mom.
I love you! ! Happy Mother's Day! !
Lovealways your lil sis,
Loretta 'Boo' (That's my sister's nickname for me. She has always called me that every since we were little.)
