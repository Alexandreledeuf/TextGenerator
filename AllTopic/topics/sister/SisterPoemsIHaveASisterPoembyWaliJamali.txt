Every Morning,
When i open up my eyes
Love-wrapped whispers greet me.
In the grim moments of the day
The unseen power of her love guards me.
She wards off all ominious un-cannies
With her pitched supplications.
She bleeds in my love.
She flies in my love.
She blossoms in my love.
Lo and Behold! I have a sister.
As sweet as a Raspberry.
As gentle as morning breeze.
The un-matched is her love for me
And none equals to  my Adi.
*Adi: Sindhi substitute for sister.
Dedicated To Sweetest Shah Bano.
