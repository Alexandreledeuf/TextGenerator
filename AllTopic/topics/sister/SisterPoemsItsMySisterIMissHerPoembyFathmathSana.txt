it is a story,
i always wanted to tell,
Once upon a time, i had a sister,
who is DEAD!
i missed her so much,
she missed me too,
well.... i thought like that,
and i wished why,
but i knew she would be happy,
in the glory of the heaven,
she will have everything she wants,
and would love to share me some,
she is super,
she is wonderful,
i see her in my dreams,
and always wondered what she will be thinking now,
it's a pleasure that she is safe,
with all the good things in there,
i wish i will see her for once,
just to take a good look at her,
and to say, 'always missed you,
and loved you'
looking at her bay pictures,
does not help,
it is true,
that i get bored without her,
but i only wanted a person like her,
to share my feeling,
if she is with me now,
we would be happy togerther,
just if you don't believe me, readers,
just ask my parents,
i miss her so much,
i love her very much,
it just hurt me more,
when thinking about her...............
