Love
Touch life with the charm of soul
Love as star shines
As the rain falls
Love smiles
Thinking about love
Wondering if she love
Is strong in brother heart
She said sweet talking man
You mister sweet talking man
Yet the truth must be heard
Watch out love coming
Surrender try one love
Close to find what brings
The sister to accepted the brother
Walk talk love
Feel the blessing
Of the eyes of love on life
It about the sister with brown eyes
Smiles that warm the heart
It about sister with the braids
About skin kiss by YAH love
Just right the shade darkness
It a dream come to life
In sister of soul
