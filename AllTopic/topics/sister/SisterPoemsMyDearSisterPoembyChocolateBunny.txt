I dedicate this poem to my sister.  who I love so much.
My Dear Sister
You may fall but I have your back
You may forget, but your schedule I have on track
You may forget me, but I won’t you
You may not remember what to do
But in this fight we’ll walk side by side
But whenever you need I’ll give you a ride
My Dear Sister
Do not fret
I’ll be the very best friend you’ve ever met
My dear sister when you are in need
The very words you say I will take heed
My Dear Sister
I love you so much
When your spirit wounded my shoulder is you crutch
