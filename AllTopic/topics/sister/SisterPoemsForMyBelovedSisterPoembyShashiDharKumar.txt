Someone who will understand
Who knows the way I feel
In every situation
Her concern is very real…
Someone who has touched my heart
Who knows my every need
Times when she would see me cry
Her heart would nearly bleed…
Everyone should have a sister
Just the way I do
Even though your far away
Richly blessed is what I am
To have a sister like you…
