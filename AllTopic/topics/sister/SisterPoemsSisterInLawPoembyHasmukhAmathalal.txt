Sister-in-law has got special position
All liberties but close relation out of question
So much praise showered on her with special mention
Husband praises  without any hesitation
She stands as half wife for full wife
Vacancy is filled when situation is rife
Not to worry for any good flirt
Wife has to remain quiet but always alert,
No sweet but good and colourful relation,
Happy moments and adding to elations,
No tension and worry when she is around,
You can have  easy walk on slippery ground
Husbands take pride in having in law
Don’t find fault or any other flaw
Always ready and anxious to  care
Prefer all relation but to be seen no where
Wives too happy and share lenient views
Allows no  freedom which is undue
After all, in law is her real sister
Above all, husband is her real mister
So long not married, everything goes well
After her departure, it turns into hell
No one is prepared for stories to tell
It was only phase not much to dwell
Even kids may prefer in law to mother
Not even look in home even at father
This doesn’t drive them crazy any more
No one takes note and stress or bother
This is delicate relation and bound to suffer
Many ups and downs with stories to offer
Many may argue with difference of opinion
After al it is sister-in- law and not the companion
