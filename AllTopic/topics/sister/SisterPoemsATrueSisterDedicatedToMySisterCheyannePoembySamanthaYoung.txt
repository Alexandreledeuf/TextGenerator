I will always love you no matter what
There is just that bond that can't be cut
Though we sometimes fight with each other
I'll stick up for you and be your cover
If people want to go after you, they have to go through me
So make sure you tell that to everyone you see
You are my little sister and I'll be there for you till the end,
For you are not just my little sister.....
You are my best friend!
