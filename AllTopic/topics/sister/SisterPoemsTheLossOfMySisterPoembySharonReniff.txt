I wish there were words I can say
what I feel from day to day
Nobody knows what I'd do
For abother moment with you
I remember your smile
it would keep me going an extra mile
I remember all the great time we shared
cause your the one who truly cared
You said you'd always be there
now your gone, its just not fair!
Why did you take your life
only memories are left to remember you by.
I would give anything to have you back
without you my life has been a wreck
I wish there was a way to fill this empty space
But no one could take your place!
