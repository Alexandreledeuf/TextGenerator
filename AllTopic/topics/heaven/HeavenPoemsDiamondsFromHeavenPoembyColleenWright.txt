Too many long scorching summers of unending heat
have passed and burned away hopes - no rain â€“ defeat.
Fine, powdery and silky, red soils move in the hot winds
from original places to new locations, including dust bins.
The soft, silky sands drift and cause anguish and pain
where various seeds of winter's plantings show no gain.
Sunburned and weathered faces show pain of different kind,
pains of hunger and thirst, and of each a very worried mind.
Vultures circle clear, blue skies ready to attack weakened prey,
as the struggle of life continues to fight for life for another day.
Once tall, strong, trees, and native shrubs, plants and flowers
are now desperately clinging to life in their last days and hours.
Years, months, weeks, and days drag by as some clouds gather
and then as quickly fade away to leave living things in a lather.
Then one day a miracle does happen as one of God's clouds burst
as a dropp or two does very gradually show, maybe over the  worst.
Suddenly with utter shock and disbelief, as almost loss of hope,
sparkling, liquid diamonds fall and rush from the sky, as if to elope.
Dancing diamonds appear now as if dripping silver from the trees,
as the softness of the welcomed rains fall - and again, all is at ease.
