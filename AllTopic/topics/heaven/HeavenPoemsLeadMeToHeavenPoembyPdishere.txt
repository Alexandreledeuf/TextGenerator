Standing in the frigid ice,
I shiver at the gust of cold daggers.
Why shall I pay the price,
When traitors were my so called brothers?
Fighting for my dearest country
With my fellow brothers, all so bravely
That’s when enemy bombs struck our bunkers
Drained were my captain’s colours.
Conspiracy, that’s what it was
Who had sold our war plan to the dogs?
When the shots died and so did soldiers
Captain held me by my collar.
Someone had played a dirty game
Secret papers were leaked and I was blamed
They called me war hero and now I was despised
All because of a bundle of lies.
Convicted for a crime that never was mine
I’d rather have died in fire’s line.
I rot in the jail and wait for release
But I have a few days life on lease.
I hope for the law to favour me
I wait to be proclaimed 'not guilty'
Badges taken and uniform shredded
Oh god, please end this dark ballad.
Everyone hates me, except my wife
For she knows I can never betray.
I know you can see the truth too
Then please send angels to my rescue.
Let the angels lead me to heaven
Play the trumpets, draw the curtain
I want peace and want to be respected
That I shall find only when I’m dead.
I will feel bad about leaving my wife
But she’ll be fine in a matter of time.
Lead me to heaven, end my life
Cause I haven’t slept well in a longtime.
