To you honey,
may you rest in the same peace
I had when we were together
If the sky could dance
I would dance with it forever
So that you could see us from Heaven
And smile.
If my memories with you
Could fit in a star
I would observe the stars
Every night
Until the dawn comes,
Or until I fell asleep
Thinking of you.
If every little bird
Could be a messenger
I would send you a love letter
With every single one of them.
If I could do all that
nights would not drug themselves in pain,
misery would be transformed in tears
and my well-kept 'I love you' would
no longer feel neglected and forgotten.
Now I can only
Dance your favourite dance alone,
Until my knees hurt more than my dry eyes
Sing your favourite song alone,
Until I run out of breath
Like I did the first time we met.
Write you a love letter
And send it to Heaven
hoping that you can forget my ignorance
on how precious time is
to be wasted on single kisses
under the warm sun.
