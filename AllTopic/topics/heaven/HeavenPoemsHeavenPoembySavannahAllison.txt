Heaven, where the streets are made of gold,
Heaven, where you never age or grow old,
Heaven, where lifes secrets unfold,
Heaven, where the secrets are told,
Heaven, where flowers grow wild,
Heaven, once again your a child,
Heaven, the weathers always warm and mild,
Heaven, where wings lay open in piles,
Heaven, where we are free,
Heaven, cant you see?
Heaven, its for you and for me,
Heaven, when we are free.
