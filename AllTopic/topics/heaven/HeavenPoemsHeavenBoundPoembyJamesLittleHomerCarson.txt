The end of time is comming,
the signs all say it's true.
Satan is on the loose, he's attacking me and you.
But I can't wait until that day, when he is eternally bound.
I'll be in the sky with Jesus, and I'll be Heaven bound.
I'm Heaven bound, I'm Heaven bound,
Jesus is the reason, that I am Heaven bound.
If you want to go with me, when that trumpet sounds,
Just believe in Jesus and and you'll be Heaven bound.
Don't wait until tomorrow, you may not have that long,
Jesus is the answer, to what ever you've done wrong.
Just call upon His Holy Name and He'll be able to say,
Come in my faithful servant, on that Judgement Day.
I'm Heaven bound, I'm Heaven bound,
Jesus is the reason, that I'm Heaven bound.
If you want to go with me, when that trumpet sounds,
Just believe in Jesus, and you'll be heaven bound.
When I get to Heaven, and walk those streets of gold,
Stand before the King of Kings, with all those Saints of old,
I know when I get there, I'll be on Holy Ground,
Glory Hallelauh! I am Heaven bound.
I'm Heaven bound, I'm Heaven bound,
Jesus is the reason, that I'm Heaven bound.
If you want to go with me, when that trumpet sounds,
Just believe in Jesus, and you'll be Heaven bound.
Just believe in Jesus, and you'll be Heaven bound.
