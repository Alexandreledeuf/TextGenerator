Wrapped in your arms
Souls entwined
Floating in love's whipped cream
Silver lined
Heaven descends on earth.....
Swimming rose petals
Heady wine
A poem befalls upon us
God's sign
Heaven descends on earth......
Long nights of passion
Nine to nine
Climbing peaks unimagined
Finding our shrines
Heaven descends on earth.....
Completing each other
Love divine
Birth after birth after birth
Forever thine
Heaven descends on earth.....
