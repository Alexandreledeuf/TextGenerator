Drifting on wings of an agnel,
The stairway to Heaven unfolds,
The steps leading up to a city,
The pathways transparent of gold.
At the base of the ascending staircase,
A lamb sits soft at the door,
Surrounded by lilies and lions,
Grace has transcended the roars.
The Lamb offers peace in His presence,
Your fears He'll caress like a dove,
The soft gentle fleece of His body,
Will cover you up in His love.
Then soft as the wings of an agnel,
He'll carry your cares to the door,
The Lamb knows the steps of the staircase,
He's traveled this pathway before.
The bright shining lights at the entrance,
Glowing like elegant gems,
Reflect the love of His shepherd,
As he beckons His Lamb to come in.
All of your burdens and heartaches,
Which the Lamb has offered to bear,
He lays at the feet of the Shepherd,
Whose love has invited them there.
Then drifting on wings of an angel,
The stairway to Heaven descends,
The powerful peace of the Lion,
Waiting soft in the heart of the Lamb.
