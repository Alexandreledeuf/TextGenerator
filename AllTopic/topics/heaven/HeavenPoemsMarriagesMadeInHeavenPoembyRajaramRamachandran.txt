To make a glass cup
It takes few minutes,
But to break it up,
It takes split seconds.
We smell the rose
Not by crushing it,
But thro' the nose,
By handling it soft.
The baby with care
Her mother fondles
As she wants to share
Her love with kisses.
Likewise, a marriage
That's made in Heaven,
Confirms a life bondage
Between man and woman.
Marriage's a sacred institution,
A bachelor wants to get in
But feeling it a great burden,
Thereafter, out he wants to run.
The wife's like a rose
The husband should feel,
And he is like a glass
With care she should handle.
Any divorce, will there be
If each one respects,
Whatever any difference be,
The other one's feelings?
Will the Heaven pardon
If they break their ties,
Violating its sanction,
For few silly reasons?
