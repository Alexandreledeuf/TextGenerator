How can true knowledge fade and disappear?
Where does it go?  Only the other day
My fingers touched the stars;  and yet today
Known formulations blur, to re-appear
As dusty platitudes at which I peer
Uncomprehendingly.  It slipped away -
My recognition of the gods at play,
The shaft of light that showed me why I'm here.
But has it really gone, or does it lie
Below the surface of the clouded mind -
A reservoir of truth whose rich supply
Can never be depleted by mankind.
Light will not fail, but we who occupy
The other end of heaven can be blind.
