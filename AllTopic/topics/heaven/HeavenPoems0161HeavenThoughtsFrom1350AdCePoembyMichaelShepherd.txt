Heaven is not a place; it is a state;
not in the clouds, nor here on earth beneath;
heaven's not in front, behind, nor left nor right -
and yet, in love it comprehends all these.
God is not found by silence, nor by speech;
not found by fasting, nor by finest food;
not by seclusion, nor by company -
and yet, within all these, and all around.
There's nowhere, thus, to go; for all is here;
and nought to do but, present, here to rest;
and resting, wish and will and love God dear
with full intent; no other interest.
All's within the heart, so vast, so great -
for heaven's not a place; it is a state.
