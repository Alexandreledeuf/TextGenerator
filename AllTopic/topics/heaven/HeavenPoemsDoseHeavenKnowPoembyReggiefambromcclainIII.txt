dose heaven know you belong to me?
dose heaven know do the angel see?
why so fast, why this early,
why take you life, why they set my tears dropping free,
the angels couldnt see our love, couldnt see what we could be,
your life was so could, so slippery to hold,
a cold love story, a story to be told,
dose heaven know do the angel see?
that they snatched and stole you away from me?
