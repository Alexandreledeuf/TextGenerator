If Love Is Heaven, And Sadness is Hell
I'm Used To This Sadness And Seperation
Heaven Is Far Away, I Accept Hell Today
I Have A Belief That A Thousand Flowers Will Bloom
And Then, This Hell Will Turn Into Heaven
Only When God Will Give back
My Dear One
My Destination
My Love.

Agar Pyaar Ho Jannat, Aur Tanhai Ho Nark
Mujhe tanha karke judaai ki ho chali hai ek aadat
Jannat Hai Meelon Dur, Nark Bhi Hai Aaj Kabool.
Vishwaas Hai Mera ki khilemgey Saikadon Phool
Tab Nark Ban Jayega Jannat
Jab Mujhe Eshwar Lautadega
Meri Amanat
Meri Manzil
Mera Pyaar.
