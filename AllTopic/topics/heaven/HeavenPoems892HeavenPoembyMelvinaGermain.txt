To finally meet the King of Fathers.
To look upon his face, and know the
one who stood beside us, through
strife and hardships grueling race.
A chance to meet the Son of God, who
laid his life upon the cross and asked
forgiveness for our sins. To touch his
long, flowing robe, knowing life will
now begin.
Where soft, warm winds blow, over
quiet blissful gardens filled with
scents of aromatic kindness and
shadows of silhouette dancers.
Watch the angels whisper by, singing
Songs of harmony ore the sky
playing harps and flutes so dear.
A place to bask in all it’s pleasure,
Gifts of glorious, heavenly treasures.
The paradise we’ve longed for. A
meeting place of those gone before us.
Now our chance to carry on, in deep
thoughts of communication, singing
sweet spiritual song.
Alas to realize,  no more worries, nor
bills to pay, nor rent, nor mortgage nor
unpleasantries on any given day.
Away from the darkness to the light,
to glorious everlasting life.
