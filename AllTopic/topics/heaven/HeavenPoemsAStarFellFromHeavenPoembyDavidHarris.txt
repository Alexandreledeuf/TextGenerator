A birthday poem for my wife
A star fell from heaven
Into my arms last night
As we walked arm in arm
Under a cloudy moonlight
Now heavens missing an angel
Because I’m holding her tight
You came into my life
Like the first ray of the sun
And I knew right away
That you were the one
There were no need for words
Just a small simple smile
My heart fluttered
With coming of the dawn
Because like the stars
I hoped you wouldn’t be gone
I wanted you there at my side
As each day fades to into night
I wanted you here
As my lover and wife
Your not going back
I won’t let you go
I love you too much
To ever let you go
