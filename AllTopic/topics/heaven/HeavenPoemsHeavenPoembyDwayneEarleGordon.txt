I want to go to heaven one of these days
Together, the King of heaven we must all praise
It is a place that was made for you and me
It is a place that we all are dwelling to be
The King of heaven,
He is the king of all the kings
With all his power,
He could make the heavens ring
Sing unto the Lord all ye land
As we all could see, the time is at hand
'No man is an Island'
'No man stand alone',
May the Lord keep blessing us from his royal throne
