Gold and Silver
Precious gems untold
Diamonds and pearls
Streets of gold
Walls of jasper
A crown of life
Awaits us all
On the other side
Heavens gates
Will you enter in
The wealth of life
Where there's no sin
No tears will fall
From our eyes
No room for sorrow
Or sad good byes
Beauty and glory
Will always abound
Heavens sweet music
An angelic sound
Rays of glitter
Sparkle and shine
A place called Heaven
I claim as mine
