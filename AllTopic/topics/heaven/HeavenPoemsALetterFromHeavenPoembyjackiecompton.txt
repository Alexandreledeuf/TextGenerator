Dear sweet innocent child of mine.
I am writing you this letter from heaven.
Just to let you know that Mother still loves you.
Don't worry about me for I am doing fine.
For it is I that is worried about you.
As I walk through the garden of eternal life.
I hear your silent prayers very clearly.
Mother knows that there will be times that you fill like giving up,
but don't you do it sweet child of mine.
For God has assured me that a long days journey is made shorter by
taking the first step toward him.
In the beginning, as in the end.
He will take two steps toward you.
So my dear sweet child keep on climbing.
For I am sure sweet child of mine.
God never built a stairway to nowhere for you to climb.
