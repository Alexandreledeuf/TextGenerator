It’s your birthday today Mum.
And wherever you are, near or far,
I want you to know that we remember you.
Not just today, but every day,
and we mourn the way
you were taken.
You were snatched cruelly from our lives,
leaving a lonely, empty hole.
Maybe God needed an angel, though.
And it was you he painfully stole.
We all miss you Mum.
Even the boys, who you never met.
We all love you Mum.
And we’ll never, ever forget.
