Deep within the realms of Heaven,
Dwells the one and only King,
Father, Jesus, Lord, Creator,
Ruler over everything.
Healer of the wounded spirit,
Mender of the hurting soul,
Comforter to all who suffer,
Making all these 'beings' whole.
Call Him when you need a listener,
He's someone who'll hear your cry,
Pray to Him for guidance always,
He will constantly reply.
Be at one with God your Saviour,
Hand in hand your whole life through,
And with all his Grace and Favour,
He will always welcome you.
