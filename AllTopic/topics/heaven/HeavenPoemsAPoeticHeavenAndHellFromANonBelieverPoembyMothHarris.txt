Hearts bleed a beautiful red, like a curtain to our love
We walk through slowly like we don't even hear a sound
With each step we take new comfort and salvation is found
We walk together like we don't have a care in the world
I saw a beautiful heaven there when I looked above
We walked though together and the white clouds did their best but
Our first steps left us hanging in a nameless ten month rut
Since then angels did sing, It was salvation that I found
I saw the burning pits of hell and how they called my name
I stumbled in uncertain, your pretty face not around
So I let my body rest there, dead in the burning ground
Winter woke me suddenly with it's chills, you're not there still
I looked up, saw you in heaven, you smiled bright like a star
He made you happy, I thought to myself 'Stay where you are,
My heart is done now and forever, love has left it's scar, '
So I grabbed my knees and pulled them close so I'd fall asleep
I dreamed of far better times far before my fall to hell
Before it froze over and gave me this story to tell
I dreamt that you kissed broken me upon my pale blue cheek
but I looked over at you and my wide eyes did not blink
That's when I learned my lesson, not to play with caring hearts
It's not so easy to pick up the pieces when it falls apart
Your heart gets shakey and forever easily scared
I'm so sorry that I took for granted that you cared
Now I walk in beautiful heaven again with burned wings
You make me so happy that I forget that my heart stings
I've never been this happy so I need you to understand
From time to time I still close my weary eyes and wonder
If I'm still dreaming...
