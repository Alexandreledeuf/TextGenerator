Someone told me that when we go to heaven,
it will be full of Hollywood gangster movies and
we’ll have to select which one we want to live
in forever. I assume you’ll choose The
Godfather. That’s the obvious choice, but I
think I would have to pick Key Largo. I would
never get tired of hearing Edward G. Robinson
say, “Thousands of guys got guns, but there’s
only one Johnny Rocko! ” And I would play
Humphrey Bogart and I would get to say,
“I used to have hopes, but I gave them up.”
And Robinson would ask, “What kind of hopes? ”
And then I’d get to snarl, “Hopes for a world
where there’s no Johnny Rocko! ” Hot damn!
Can you think of a better way to spend eternity?
Sure beats lying around on clouds with that
infernal harp music blaring in your ears.
