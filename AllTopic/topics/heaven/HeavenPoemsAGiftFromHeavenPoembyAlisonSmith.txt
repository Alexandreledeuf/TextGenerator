They were created with perfection
But arrived before well baked
Sent to show the way
Searchers of another day
Nestled in our hearts
Never to be forgotten
Drawn now into dream
Revel in the knowing
The angels of adventure.
Arrived as a calm against the storm
Opening the changes around
They escaped this reality
Leaving a message of trust
Treat the coming for what it is
And explore the dream
For they where a gift from heaven
Simple the delight they gave
Melting the hearts around
Into sleep now taken
These tiny infants of the dream
They herald the changes within.
