The little girl
stood in
the meadow.
She had been
asked by God
to raise her eyes
and look to him,
And so she did.
Soon gold and silver
came raining
down from Heaven,
it was a veritable
deluge.
While she rejoiced
and raised her skirt
to catch the coins
the dirt claws
of Lucifer
reached through
the moss and
curled up leaves.
So silently
and filled with
invisibility.
And with the stench
of sulfur
surrounding her
and all the riches
she never knew
when slowly,
imperceptibly,
with certainty,
her nickers,
sweetly embroidered
just a week ago
by Nana,
were taken
by filthy hands
while angels
watched
with kindness.
