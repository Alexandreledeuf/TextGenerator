I dream of a heaven overlooking the river Nile
The Pyramids at a distance
Fishermen in rickety feluccas
A blazing September sunset
And you sitting next to me
Your face touched with a smile
Questions and confessions
Musings and impressions
Self-expression without permission
Soul searching free of inhibition
First experiences with no apprehension
Bliss and content beyond comprehension
Time frozen as emotions flow
A sense of security with an afterglow
Feelings soaring in crescendo
Tender words and sweet innuendo
Stolen moments to forever cherish
Shared memories that will never perish
