I'd pull down heaven and wrap you in the Milky Way If I could,
For you are the sun, the moon, and the stars to me.
If I could, I'd roll the ocean back to lay Atlantis dry beneath your feet,
For you are the tide, the waves, and the sand to me.
At your request, I'd steal the Taj Mahal and languish in prison like Shaj Jahan,
For you are the seventh wonder of my world, a goddess, my everything.
Though I give you the elixir of life and die while you remain forever young, I will always love you!
