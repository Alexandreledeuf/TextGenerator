'Marriages are made in heaven'
so say people in India
a good marriage can your life lengthen
it can be your ultimate good karma.
My marriage was made in hell
Bad karma from beginning to end
Kept me for years in a prison cell
Finally, I don't have to pretend.
My marriage was made in hell
no love or affection, felt like a bad spell
A bad marriage can ruin your life
For so many years, I had no life.
The hell marriage is now over
Promise I won't do it again, ever
I'm finally free from the shackles
Thought I'd be happy, but I see no sparkles.
All I'm left now with is wrinkles
My life's hard and full of struggles
Still, I find my freedom wonderful
And I will soon start feeling worthful.
