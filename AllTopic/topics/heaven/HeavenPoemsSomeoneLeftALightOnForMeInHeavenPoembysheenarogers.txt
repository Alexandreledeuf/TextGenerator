Somebody Left A Light On For Me In Heaven
(Dedicated to my Family, and Maya Angelou)
Somebody left a light on for me in heaven so I can find my way home
I’ve been searching and searching for the place I belong
Somebody left a light on for me in heaven because they cared enough for me,
That light is left on,
Now I can see
I can see my way through the pain and the mistrust
Through faith and obedience
Christ is the just
He is the just for all
He won’t let you fall
Somebody left a light on; yes I say this with a smile on my face
His love and compassion
I will daily embrace
That light is so bright, I can see through and through
At night He says my child take a rest
I left the light on
Because my Son the Christ died for you
