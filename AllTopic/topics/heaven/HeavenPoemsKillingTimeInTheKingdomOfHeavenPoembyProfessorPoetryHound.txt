Exactly what does one do in eternity?
Do you just walk around all day
in loose-fitting togas?
Is your soul in some kind of
infinite spiritual rush?
Now that would be pretty cool,
at least at first.
But it would probably get old
after awhile.
So... are there activities?
Like, can we sit at card tables
(probably on some chintzy foldout
chairs)    playing Texas Hold â€˜em?
Do we get an eternal supply
of poker chips?
Personally, I'd like to opt out of
the Bingo games, you know,
and step outside for a smoke.
I certainly hope they have
TVs in eternity.
But I wonder, is it commercial-free
or does the Lord come on
every once in awhile
and congratulate you
for betting the right way?
