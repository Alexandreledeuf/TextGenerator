May the Lord be my shepherd
you can guide me to heaven
I would never be saved
if it were not for you.
But I ask you my Saviour
will you please ascertain
that the one they call Shepherd
stay asunder from you.
I don't know how in heaven
we will all get along
once we meet all the gangsters
and the ones with no schlong.
I'll apply for the work as
the cleaner of rubbish
thus  the chance will apply
they will tumble from heaven
let the bygones go by.
