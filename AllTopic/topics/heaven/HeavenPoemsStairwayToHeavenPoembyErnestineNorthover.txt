The stairway to heaven
Lies way beyond my soul,
Far-away from my heart,
And out of my control.
As I pass each second,
Of every single day,
I take steps to travel,
This far and distant way.
The stairway to heaven
Leads to a final goal,
When earthly life's absorbed
Via blending of the whole.
