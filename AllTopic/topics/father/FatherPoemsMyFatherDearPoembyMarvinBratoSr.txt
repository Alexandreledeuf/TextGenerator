Rare can I find a father
Of great statue and character
Man of words and honor
Even possess good humor
Often a friend to many more.
Man of guts and practicality
A respected guy in the locality
Law abider
Often a good provider
Never he gets angry without reason
Especially if one has to learn a lesson
Surely he'll teach anyone just soon.
Being my father
I'm proud to be his daughter
Like a sheep that sheepherder feeds
Lavishing me with my own basic needs
On certain condition that he always point
Never will I do him wrong or disappoint
Exerting much efforts my father do not rest
Simply because he wants to give me the best.
