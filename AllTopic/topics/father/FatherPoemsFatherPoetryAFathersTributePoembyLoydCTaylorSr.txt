FATHERS
Fathers …
They are strong
When we need protection.
They are tender
When we need affection.
Fathers …
They are near
To chase our fears away.
They work hard
To provide day after day.
Fathers …
Their tasks many
Free minutes are so few.
They are special
For all the things they do.
Fathers …
They are disciplinarians
Yet soothe our pains away.
They are spiritual leaders
And taught us how to pray.
Fathers …
They are heroes
Though perfect they are not.
They are gracious
Our flaws some how forgot.
Fathers …
They are misjudged
In time they’ve given us.
They give wisdom
Through words spoken in love.
Fathers …
They are treasures
So today let us start,
Honoring our Father
And love with all our heart.
