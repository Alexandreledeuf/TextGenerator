Father, i'm no Catholic
but i must Confess:
i've been a bad girl.
My mind's Mayor of the Gutter
and my Body's just a tool for him
(whoever 'he' is...)
Fantasies are my harsh Reality;
maybe i'm a little 2Fast2Furious...
I see more of the boys than meets the eye
when I see them walking by.
Yeah, you don't have to remind me;
I know it's a Tragedy
that I must write these Sins
