Holding the little finger of your hand,
Walking on the mounds of paddy field,
Watching the dancing of green weeds,
Like the cuscuta weed in tomato field;
Watching greenery in the wet sand,
Teaching me to pluck the parasitic weeds,
Like sparrow teaching young to pick seeds
Helping paddy to grow with a healthy blend
Taking me out everyday  morning,
For a long paddy field walking,
Sparking a practice of dreaming
To be focused on becoming something;
I owe you for what I am,
You taught me to be a man,
With values I will live till I am,
You took me around to show our world,
Like the Sun taking the planets around,
Whenever I needed, You were there around
Like the sun, moon, planets going round and round
Teaching virtues which were in you profound,
Like the Egyptian sphinx on a mountain mound,
Giving the  books of Jesus & Vivekananda
Helping me to find divine ananda,
In those ancient sermons of Vedas
And the verses of sage Sarvajna;
