Master of truth, destroyer of pain,
You have the power to give health back again.
Here me Master, cover me with your love.
Send your blessings from  high up  above.
I’ve followed in your footsteps, praised  your name.
I loved you from childhood but suffer just the same.
What have I done to displease you  my King,
Please find a way to whisper in my ear.
I’ll wait for you Master, oh yes I will surely hear.
I can only question, and ask for a reason,
but I will accept what you do any day, any season.
Lord I ask this question because I don’t understand.
You are the king, and your final word stands.
I’ll take my pain and my troubles to bear,
Lord God I’ll  wait patiently and hope soon to hear.
If no word comes Master and you close earth’s door.
Please take me Father to your Heavenly shore.
