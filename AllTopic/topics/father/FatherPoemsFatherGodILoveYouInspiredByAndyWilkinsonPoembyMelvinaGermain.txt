Some believe their faith is a private thing,
While others praise and through their voices sing.
You must not allow anyone to silence your view,
Brothers and sisters, God truly loves you.
A child of God, is aware of God’s awesome gift,
and given the ability to witness His spiritual lift.
This gift must be shared with all around,
through written verse, speech or spiritual song.
I bear witness and give God all the glory,
For He is my everlasting story.
I say it loud and I say it clear,
God will remain in my life, year after year.
I’ll  shout it from the rooftops,
Father God, I love you, I’ll never stop.
I’ll call out your name till the end of my days,
and praise you my Lord in many, many ways.
