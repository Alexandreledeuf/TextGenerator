Father, I want you to know how much I love you and appreciate
everything you do.  I know you're watching over me and always
by my side.
Father when I thought my time was up, you surprised me once
again, you gave me a helping hand and coaxed me to stand.
I was feeling weak and weary, but you wouldn't leave me alone,
so I had no choice but to listen to the whispers and follow your
lead.
I'm so glad I've learned to hear you Father and heed your every
word, for you've given me more time and I know what I must do.
I'll praise you every day and listen for your instructions, I'll witness
to others and tell them my story for you are my precious leader
and to you Father I give all the glory.
Father I ask that you put the blood of the lamb over all Poemhunter's, protect them Lord keeping them out of harms way and help them Lord to be more understanding and patient with other Poemhunter's that may not be as articulate.  We all have a voice Father and should all have equal opportunity to write our precious words, pen to paper.
Father I pray and thankyou in the name of your precious son Jesus.
Amen
