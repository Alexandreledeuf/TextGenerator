Life has many ways, of telling our age
Each more interesting, with each new page
But in my heart, you will never grow old
Dear Father of mine, with many stories to be told
With patience and love, you guided me
Bringing me up, the best I could be
You worked hard and long, even after I was grown
Thank you dear Father, for the love you have shown
So much to be learned, from your experience
All you went through, all your endurance
I will always treasure, what you have done
Dear Father of mine, you're number one
So often this child, has failed to say
How much you're loved, each passing day
And I thank God, He picked you to be
The Greatest Father, ever for me
