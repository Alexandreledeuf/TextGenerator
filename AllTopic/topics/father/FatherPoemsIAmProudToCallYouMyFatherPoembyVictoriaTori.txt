When I was just 18 months old
My real father left me
You stepped up
And raised me as your own child
You feed me
You clothed me
You taught me everything I know now
I love you dad
And I always will
You were there every step of the way
You stood by my side
And never left me
When I needed you
Youâ€™re the best dad I could ever ask for
You were there when I was scared
You were there when I cried
You were there for all my birthdays
You were in my life then
You are still in my life now
And I hope you never leave
You are way more superior than my real father
We may not have the same blood or color
But we have something better then anything
We have love for one another
And an unbreakable bond
That no one can break
Not even my real Father
I AM PROUD TO CALL YOU MY OWN FATHER
