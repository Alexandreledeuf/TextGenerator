Another birthday, God has given you;
’Tis time you thought about your age and health;
God’s love and mercy in life has been true;
Your family and fortitude’s- your wealth.
’Tis time to pray extra: forget the world;
You did your part and duty indeed well;
Protect yourself from injury and cold;
Be wise: take rest and do not become ill.
Remember that you aren’t young anymore;
Your frame is frail and dangers lurk round you;
Your will-power isn’t as strong as before;
A long life-span comes only to a few.
‘Wish you a Happy Birthday, ’ dear Maama!
God be with you in your earthly drama!
From,
Mercy, Celestine, Cathy and Diana
