Today my prayer will be short and sweet for you Father has given me yet another day to stand with strength upon my feet.  Father I ask only one thing in this short little prayer.  I ask Father that you unite  all the people of this earth as one.  I ask Father that you help us to realize that we really are sisters and brothers, that we are covered by the blood of the lamb, that no one can come between us while we are holding your glorious hand.  Father unite us so that we will grow strong and able to fight the enemy.  Protect us Father while we stand as soldiers under your great umbrella.  Let us find peace in this world Father.  I leave it all to you Father for you are our great leader, you are the King,   You have the ability to make great mountains crumble and to part the rough waters of the sea, you are the all knowing and the great almighty.
Father I leave this prayer for peace to you, knowing that you will know what to do.
I pray Father in the name of your precious son Jesus.  Amen
