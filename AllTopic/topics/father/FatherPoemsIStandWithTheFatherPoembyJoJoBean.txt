'I know where I came from
and I know where I am going'
Because I am not alone
I walk with a God all knowing
He is the light of the world
and when I follow He lights my way
No longer in darkness I trod
I have the light of life through all my days
All you need to do is welcome Him in
He will conquer the unconquerable soul
Wait with an open heart my sisters and brothers
He is the one to make you whole
Because I know where I am going
'I stand with the Father'
