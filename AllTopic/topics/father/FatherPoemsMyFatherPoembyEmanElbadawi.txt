He was
No I can't say 'he was'
He is
In my heart
He is
In the core of my heart
He is
In the heart of my love
Still
He is
My love
His gentleness
I can never forget
Valentine is at the door
And still
I can not love
Anyone more
His death
Was a birth for him
And for myself
A death
To happiness
Seven years have passed
And men are his shadow!
