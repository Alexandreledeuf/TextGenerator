'Father?
Yes...LAWRENCE!
'Did I catch You at a bad time? '
No, My Son...What is it? ...Now?
'Maybe I should come back?
You don't sound right! '
Is this about your poems?
'YEAH! Wow...how did You know that? '
Because I Am ALL THAT!
Now get on with it!
'You don't have to get all...
All...'
All WHAT? And you better be careful!
'Well, I made a decision...
I'm not sure it was the right one! '
You mean eliminating your poems from PoemHunter?
Those wonderful poems I gave to you to write?
Some of the most beautiful words I shared with you?
Some of the most incredible insights...
We, you and I 'painfully' stayed up all day and many nights,
Putting together?
Many of them bringing tears to My own eyes! ?
'UH...are You upset with me, Father? '
Does a donkey spread mustard on a banana sandwich?
DOES IT! ?
'HUH? '
Let's discuss this at another time!
Right now I Am in no mood to play hide n' seek!
Is that clear? ANSWER ME, BOY!
'Yes Father!
I'll catch You at another time! '
YEAH! Whatever...
('Does a donkey spread mustard on a banana sandwich?
That makes absolutely no sense! Oh, that boy...one day,
One day...')
