Father you are always on my mind, I love you Father and trust
in you with all my heart.  I have no questions  for your decisions,
my faith is strong and true.
Father I’m in awe when I look around this world, when I stand
and take in the awesome views, I know this is the work of the
Master, and that Master for certain is you.
This morning Father I pray for those without faith, who can not
see pass their noses.  They have eyes that function, but they
truly can not see.
Father give these blind people the ability to come out from their
deadened shells, touch them with your spirit, let them see the
light.
Oh Father God, drench them with your love so they make no
mistake.  Take them by the hand so some day they too will
walk through Heaven’s Gate.
Father sometime young people are taken in  by those who have
no interest in their soul but only in the money that they hold.
The devil’s people live among us, taking advantage of many.
Your children need  your guidance Father and your continued
patience for I truly  believe some day they will come out of the
darkness, walk into the light and face the truth.
Father I leave these people to you, in your caring hands.  May
they make Jesus the center of their lives and join their brothers
and sisters who know the  truth, save them Father.
I Love you Father and I ask this Lord in the name of your only
Son Jesus.-Amen
