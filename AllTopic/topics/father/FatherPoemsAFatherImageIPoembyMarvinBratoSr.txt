Oh father, my father
Am humbled by your ways
As you sustain innate integrity
Of having a low profile lifestyle
Always patience and responsible
As you stay loving mum till now
Oh father, my father
Am inspired by your manners
As you hold the cool temperance
Of always being forgiving and caring
Always supportive and understanding
As you are standing by for us till now
Oh father, my father
Am encourage by your humility
As you practice sound principles
Of fatherhood and a counselor
Always guiding us by example
As you live a clean life till now
No wonder I am your son
As I walk on your footsteps
Of being a dear good father
To my beloved own family
How I wish I could live on
To be like you till now at 75
