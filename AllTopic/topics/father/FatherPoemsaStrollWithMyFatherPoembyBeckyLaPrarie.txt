I arose with my Lord upon my mind
And it occurred to me that no
Better or more reliable friend
Could one ever find!
Yesterday is a faded memory
For each day is brand new
And I know today is no exception
My Father has new things for me to do
Thank you Father for another day
And teach me now what role
For you this day I shall play
Plant my feet in the area of need as
You and I take our daily stroll
In your garden of love
But first cleanse me of my sins
And wash me as white as the
Wings of a snow white dove
Prepare my heart and my mind too
For all the glorious things you
Will for me to do
Then when my work this day is done
Arrange my thoughts to focus
Even more upon your only Son
Let me not close my eyes in sleep
Until I go to you in prayer
And thank you Lord for
Being right beside me
For you have always been
Right there
