You're ALL things on Earth...and Above.
You opened up my eyes,
Your power can not be denied.

And giving!

Where all people live in peace.
In true harmony released!
Thank You Father,

Thank You Father,
The breath that I breathe
Just could not be.

And each day...
It is clear that You're everywhere!
With You...
Why should I despair?
