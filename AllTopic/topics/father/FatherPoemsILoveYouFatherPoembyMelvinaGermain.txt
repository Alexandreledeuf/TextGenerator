Dear Lord in Heaven, I woke up this morning with you on my mind,
realizing how precious it is to be a part of humankind.
To have the opportunity to live on this great earth, to witness the
miracles of life’s awesome births.
Lord knowing I always have you by my side, I walk with grace and
stand with pride.
I’ll worship you Lord until my dieing day, knowing a new day Lord
will be coming my way.
Father God, I thank you for all the gifts you have given me,
my children, my talents, my prosperity.
Lord I may not be rich in materialistic wealth but I treasure your
love and spiritual health.
Father I’ll never forget what you have done, giving of your son
Jesus so the people of this earth can live on.
I’ll end this morning Lord by letting you know, your love is precious
and I love you so.
In the name of your son Jesus, Amen
