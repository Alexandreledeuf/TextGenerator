You're standing in the doorway.
Your workday is all done.
He waits to see you everyday,
this boy that is your son.
He hopes you will go fishing.
He hopes you'll shoot the gun.
He just wants to be with you,
this boy that is your son.
He is your spitting image.
To him you are ''The One''.
He hopes to be just like you,
this boy that is your son.
You show him what a man is.
You teach as you have fun.
You are admired as well as loved
by this boy that is your son.
You've got a friend forever.
Until the world is done.
Then, still you will be holding
this man that is your son.
