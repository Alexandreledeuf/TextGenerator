The sun has set and the shadows fled
The feathered flocks, flown to their nest
Weary men after the day's toil and care
Are back home for sleep and rest
No bird sings and no beast strays
No tramp wanders and no lights shimmer
Silence rules and peace prevails
The sky is clear and the stars do glimmer
Buds unfold in shady glades
A sweet aroma pervades the air
Fluttering leaves sing a lullaby
And glow worms reel on wings of fire
Birds and beasts, in Nature's bosom rest
Babies nap, cuddling to their mothers tight
Tired men stretch out under quilts for ease
The world, asleep with dreams sweet and bright
A brief interlude from all angry strife
A time of farewell to all frivolous conceits
A holy night to bury our woes
And a God sent time to ease our spirits!
