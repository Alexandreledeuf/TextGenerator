Why didn’t she respond to call?
Was she really facing the wall?
Wanted to move out and roll the ball?
Was I judging it as flicker or miscall?
It was definitely welcome and invite,
Sure suggestion for passion to ignite,
Was I indication for call in dark night?
I was amused but it was alright,
I jumped two steps at a time,
Forgot what was the interest prime,
Surely can’t afford to loose the opportunity,
Everything can wait but not the girl with beauty,
She looked as if fairy came on land,
I wondered whether I can move hand in hand,
She was not ready yet to become friend,
Then why did she waved at as signal send,
I was moving in and out,
I did not feel victory but a rout,
Ready to move with laws flout,
Knew nothing what was it all about?
Where to go and whom to ask?
Seemed to me a difficult task,
Rushed to a friend for simple advice,
He too was same as I was novice,
I remembered saying” nothing is unfair”
Most valuable and treasured gift is love affair,
I thought it as simple and fair,
Fragrance spread and filled the air,
She represented dark as night,
Her thoughts were not good and right,
She embraced me with invitation to ride,
I was shocked and emotions couldn’t hide,
She was whore and I took her as right,
Difficult to come out without fight,
I rushed from the scene and left the sight,
Night seemed to me really dark night
