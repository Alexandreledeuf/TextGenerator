Identity
What is that identity
And who is competent to
Issue identity card
In whose favor
And for what purpose
All the things we have to know
From here, from our
Day to day activities.
Let me say all the identity cards
Are bogus cards as they are
Not based on Truth
And Truth needs no identity card
Like the the sun and the moon
Like the air and the sky
Like the earth and the water,
We are here to see how the clouds
Are going away from the sky
We are to see the light
Only by its grace.
Here, the question is about identity.
Identify first who is who and
What is what if you are able, my dear.
