Lion hearted man
But like stone
No emotions
But only confusion
Who cares?
And stares
At beautiful and handsome
If that is person
You hear no one
You listen to no person
You go aimlessly
And will not change hopefully
You have no feelings
Only believe in stealing
And hurt sentiments
That is real picture at present
I shall close eyes
And try
Not to be same
For my identity to claim
