Notwithstanding how you view the morn,
Or see the sunrise and the dawn,
Over the high mountain Alps,
Or over the vast blue sea, or desert sand,
The sky shall be and always retain,
Its one single identity!
Notwithstanding how you share your
heart,
Or break it up into many parts,
And  share its love with many or few,
Your heart shall be one and the same,
A single heart it shall remain!
No matter how you live this life,
Through your childhood, manhood  and
old  age,
And  live through all its different stage,
Your life shall  be  one, just the same!
Since only one life is your  due,
Live it well and then bid  adieu!
Let us then share our lives and our hearts,
As we share the sky with life on earth,
And with mankind let us maintain,
A single identity forever retain!
