This is the holy land
Where I was born
My seed was well planted
By my parents in right span;
I am from the human seed
The group is homosapien
Adam and Eve are my grandparents
We all are their children;
This land is my terminal
I will leave it after certain time
But on right path here I have to earn all
I need meet their team,
This is the only way to be successful
After the very resurrection;
Otherwise, I'll fail
And will be thrown to destruction.
