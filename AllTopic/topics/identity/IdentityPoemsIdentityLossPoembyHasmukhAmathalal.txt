Identity loss
You are victim of your own perception
It is fast changing nation
With different people at various levels
It is really turning into heaven from hell
Previously it existed
With race and cast riddled
You were subjected to harassment
But not now we find at present
If you fail to adjust
With temperament and trust
It may worsen further
With more and more anger
You are not persecuted on religion ground
Even though you may be not favorably found
Our country is full of diversity
You need to find own circle and remain happy
If you are educated little more
You shall feel always sore
That you are not finding equal and intelligent people
Here sometimes persons tends to feel loss of individuality
On the contrary, people are resorting to caste
They have got privilege test
They find room for further progress
Whereas qualified people get no easy access
