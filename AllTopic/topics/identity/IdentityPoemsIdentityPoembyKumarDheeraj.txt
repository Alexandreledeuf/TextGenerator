Truest is my identity
Truest I'm here.
I'll not shy, I'll not pretend
Coz now I don't have any fear.
Fear, That sucked me up
Was a dark black cloud to me ever
Once ruled me as a ruling king
Forced me to be his slaved queen forever.
He thought to possess me
And to leave me never.
Was darkest of all the darkness
Became a Rival lover.
His strength was really promising
Capturing me in my veins
But was actually unaware
Of my psychic powers and brains.
I came to my real I
And they all (fears) became the greatest lie
Me became the truest truth
Evil fears will surely die.
