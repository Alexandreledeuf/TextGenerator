Forgive me, I thought somebody cared,
I thought it was you
Or I would surely never dared
Reveal myself through
Who made you guardian of my days,
Master of each step?
The spirit will retaliates,
Becoming suppressed.
I thought it was you,
Wearing an angelical smile
And with sparkling eyes
Bewitching me with its magic.
As time slowly passed.
The truth was clearly revealed
When I saw the fake lover
Hiding behind the mask.
I thought it was you,
The one permanently fixed
In my heart and mind
And also in my dreams.
Disappointed now I am
But with faith and hope
I will eventually survive
And see a brighter light.
One sunny day
While the butterflies dance
And the birds happily sing,
I shall find you my angel,
The woman of my dream
