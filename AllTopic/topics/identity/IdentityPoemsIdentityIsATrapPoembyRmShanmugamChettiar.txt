Identity gives a meaning to life,
A sense of belonging in a society,
And helps one define oneself in oneself.
To lean this way is to go away from that.
Identity is a stake you cling to.
Identity is a mould you fix to.
Anything we think we are, becomes a trap,
A restriction to be something else.
You join a movement to share its force.
In the meanwhile, you lend it your force.
Subsequently you lose your independence
In judging and mortgage yourself to it.
Be in a set up not to be fanatic.
Being neither distantly isolated
Nor absolutely  identified
With anything is freedom to enjoy.
