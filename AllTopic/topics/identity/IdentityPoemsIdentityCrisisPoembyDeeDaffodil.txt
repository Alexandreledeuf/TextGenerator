To the P.H management....
I've been suffering
A loss of identity lately
I'm sure that you can see
That the person I once was
Is not currently who I be...
I've been feeling slightly odd lately
And I wish that I could say
That I'll be over it quite quickly
But I think I've lost my way...
My bearings are all boggled
And I've gotten all mixed up
Am I really upside down...
Or is it actually downside up? ?
I have no wish to offend thee
But surely you can see
If you give me back my maple leaf
I'll be as happy as can be! !
