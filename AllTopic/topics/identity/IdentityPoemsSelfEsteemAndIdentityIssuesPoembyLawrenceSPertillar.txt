Who is to say,
How someone else should be?
Or that they are not being themselves?
Especially when those claiming to be down to Earth,
Seek approval from others who also have self esteem...
And identity issues.
While those who have put a stamp on their individuality,
Are said to believe themselves better than the others...
With attempts they make to prove they seek to experience,
More than just an average existence by doing things to improve...
Their outlooks with an adventuring done to explore their lives,
Away from routine complaints and gossiping about others!
