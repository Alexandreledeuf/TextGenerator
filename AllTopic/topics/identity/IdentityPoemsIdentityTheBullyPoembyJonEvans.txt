They all try to look the same
all try to give themselves a name
pick on the boy who is all alone
just because his identity is his own
what has this world come to?
all this wrong that people do
just for the image they want to show
down the evil path they seem to go
The next person you go to hurt
or try to make feel like dirt
instead of trying to look cool
feel for the guy you make look a fool
A cool identity isn't a need
let those you bully be freed
Your identity should be your own
A better person you will be known.
