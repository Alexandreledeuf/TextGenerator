In this spiritual blindness
I hope and seek in vain
for words of lovingkindness
to ease the dreary pain.
The pain of utter loneliness,
which most of us are spared
that comes when life's experiences
and thoughts cannot be shared.
I long in my self-sympathy
to reach some other soul,
with satisfying empathy
to make my being whole.
In truth I long not all for thee
for ofttimes comes the cry,
'Where is the one who should be me?
My soul, my self,  my 'I'?
