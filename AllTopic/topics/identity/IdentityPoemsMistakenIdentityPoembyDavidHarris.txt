There are many times I have been mistaken
for something I am not.
People mistake me as an ordained priest,
but in fact, I am not.
You could call me an actor
who just happens to live the part.
Admittingly I do most things
a real priest would in their lives do,
give comfort to the sick and dying
and other things do.
However please do not be mistaken
that is not acting, its just part of my personality,
something I have always done
even before I got the part.
Those who needed my words of comfort
always seemed to find me,
and I would never turn them away.
Donâ€™t ask me why I am this way;
there is no answer I can give you.
I hate to see suffering
whether it be in friend or foe.
I made a promise to myself
a long, long time ago
that if I could make someone smile
each and every day,
then I would be smiling too.
There have been a very few times occasions
when that promise has been broken,
because sometimes I could not do it.
They were mainly when
great sadness caught up with me,
but most of the time you will find me
with a smile on my face
and mischievous twinkle in my eye.
That is because at heart
I am something of a clown
and a practical joker.
One thing I am not
and something I will never be
is what many people call me,
and that is an angel
as there are too many faults
that lie behind me.
