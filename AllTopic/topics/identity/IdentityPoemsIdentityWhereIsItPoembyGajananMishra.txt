Identity
Where is my identity
That I can show you
I am that, I am this,
And how can I show you
That I am Yours.
I am covered with falsehood
I am Truth and Truth has
No identity as You know,
No identity, no affinity,
And here I am in distress,
And here I am in dark .
O my dear, enlightened me
With knowledge that I am Yours.
