Our life experiences aren't the same.
We have our own personalites
And that's o.k.
But when that image has been changed.
By others who condemn you in everyway.
U struggle to keep yourself afloat.
When who you are, you seem not to know.
The journey to find one's self seem unsure.
The inner self broken and bruised.
Not to fear, theirs more in me.
Despite, the events that try hard to be.
My Identity is God's gift to me.
Everyone's unique, with much diversity.
So with God's grace put upon me.
Identity is also an inner beauty
That has yet to be seen.
