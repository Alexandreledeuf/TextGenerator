Lost Identity
"Who am I? "
-this question has, for years
-too many, many years, has always
-been with me, followed me, bothered me.
Time took me
-to cities like Tehran
-and later, to others, San Anton,
-Laredo, in Texas, USA to London
To over hundred, if not two and further.
In times I did research
-dined and talked and questioned
-found many Africans in States; forced slaves.
-Saw Jordan's national dance come from Circassia.
Was lost on commenting
-when friend informed me of parents:
- "Japanese, Korean"
History; as I heard in Seoul
-and elsewhere, says:
- "They are foes! "
But Russian Racism
-even the Soviets'
-Racism
Made the Non-Russians' life
-in Gulag, to unite…
They were born over there
-were raised there but passports
-till time of Gorbachev
-considered… "Not-Russian."
Now, after many years
-in passports are Russians
-but what of origin?
-Japan and Korea? !
