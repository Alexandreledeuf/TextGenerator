My sleeves hide my identity,
the side you’ll never know,
the side I’m ashamed of
and the side I’ll never show
Deep in the night
I feel the icy need
For this life to end
And me to do the deed
But this fear holds me back
This fear of death and life
yes it sounds messed up
But it evens out with a knife
The knife that slices my skin
Marring my soul forever
You’ve just cracked the surface
Love will end this endeavor
