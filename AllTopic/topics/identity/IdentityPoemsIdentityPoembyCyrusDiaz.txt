Look at me,
it's not my true identity
I have a covert identity,
i wonder if you'd ever see,
my thoughts, my deeds
are all that makes me
but something I may do
may not describe me.
My true identity
has fled me,
fled me to another
to my friends and family
my true identity
is all that makes me.
So lost deep inside
if its not for my soul
i would[d be lost again
my true identity
is hard to see.
Accept who you are
recognize your own beauty
identity isn't a need,
your identity should be your own
a better person you will be known
this is me, this is my identity
my true identity is all full of beauty.
