Holding in high esteem
My false self image
The granules of that image flow
Slipping thru the hour glass
Turning the hourglass
As many times
As repeated deceptions
And reincarnations
I insist upon,
The sand in unique arrangements
Slides thru the glass every time
Until I release the sand
Or the turning and be
The transparent glass.
