An individual identity
That matters in community
Reckoned in personal circles
Identity, the word crucial.
Identity in better meanings
The individual reputation
That is relevant and important
Identity of a human being
That is everywhere taken up.
Service to the society
Kindness to the deserving
Character and integrity
Yardstick of identity.
Man a social being
Everywhere, in every circles
His identity reckons
Make the identity in such goodness.
