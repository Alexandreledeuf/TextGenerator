From the alpine windswept quartz
rose the beautiful Frau Schwarz.
Wrote a comment erudite
(every member has that right)
but the toes of fruity cakes
cannot carry what it takes
'be a man' Frau Schwarz did ask
but it was a hopeless task.
He could neither cause delete
to her words, so in defeat
he turned all his dull attention
to another, just to mention
that he knew that Mrs. Schwarz
in her inner heart of hearts
would not criticise or knock
any Arizona cock.
So the answer simply must
be that someone full of frust
took on her identity
just to comment and to pee
on his eye-brow-raising work.
Boy he must be such a jerk.
Now the story makes more sense
people like his poems, hence
he can go back to the school
doesn't look like such a fool.
Yet, there is a little flaw
once you go into the draw
with the world of those who can
you come out a tiny man.
