I want my identity
With super quality
Not to compromise on anything
Even if tempted for something
I want to grow
But shall not allow
Shadow to grow larger
Even with temptation offer
Nobody should be high above
As you can happily prove
You should be responsible
For acts of omission and hence to struggle
It is good to assess the loopholes
Which drives and lands you in troubles
That shall be good for remaining as human
You have to prove as nice gentleman
Yes be ordinary and poor
No one shall dare to show you door
As you will be known for impartiality
And also for strong identity
