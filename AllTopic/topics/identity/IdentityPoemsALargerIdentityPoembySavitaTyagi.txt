It is not enough to have our own identity.
Our individuality is just one layer, a small brick
In a multilayered cosmic structure.
We are part of a bigger world,
And wish to be part of that larger identity.
To be a mother-father, brother-sister,
Son or  daughter or a friend and relative
Is part of accepting that greater identity.
A social activity related to the service of others
Is rewarded by a sense of elation and stimulation.
In an environment where wider consciousness
Of a larger community is overlooked
Sense of oneness is diminished.
A segregated individual starts to
Suffer from malice of loneliness
Holding an insecure place
In a large body of universal existence.
