Personal identity
Women always need attention
If all want its retention
In life and elsewhere
One must always stand firmly and dare
No doubt, they have suffered most
At heavy cost
Cruelty in behavior
And almost compromise with honor
She has stood ground well
For the whole of world to tell
'Look we are no mean creature'
But youâ€™re sure future
Generations have been bought
But we are always caught
Between good and devil
We shall survive still
We shall rise from dust
As our main asset is trust
We hold it most
As time is still not lost
Give them strength
As they serve till death
With power and dignity
And hold personal identity
