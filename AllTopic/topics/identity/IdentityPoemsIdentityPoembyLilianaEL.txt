Dig deep
Who are you
What do you want
How do you want be seen and remembered
Dig deep
What makes you happy, frustrated, angry, peaceful, free
Yeah the world tells you who to be
Blurs your vision
Smears away your identity
So take hold
Embrace this moment for yourself
Define your own identity
Reflect on how to achieve what makes you happy
Done scrambling around
Trying to please all others' wants
Put your wisdom first and the rest is sure to come
