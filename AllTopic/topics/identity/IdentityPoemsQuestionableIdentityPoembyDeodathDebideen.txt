What, not who are you, is the question
On your identity
Though you are an invisible being
The system says you're the body
Protoplasm's just biological cells
Chemically bonded together
Sex by Mother and Father
God's recipe they did foster
Dead cells you are not
Neither are you living cells
The invisible soul in the head
That body-robot propels
Soul in a body alone
Is a seeker's obsession
Such luck is not possible
Satan comes in as a possession
Physical body that's inert
Until enlivened by a soul
Corrupted by evil in the flesh
COUP is its goal
The body is one fraction
Empowered by good and evil
Soul must fight with all its might
To retrieve its body from the devil
The inner sanctum of the skull
Is where the Soul is located
The remaining flesh is satan's home
Until the dark side is defeated
So WHAT is your identity
Which 'I' do you proclaim to be
Sometimes soul, mostly dark side
Fluctuating ownership of the protoplasmic body
So civilization has us fooled
By denoting I, YOU, and WE
Such denotation varies upon
WHAT controls the body
Everyone is not the same each minute
Do not expect anything different
Soul or dark side will 'behave'
As per which one is ascendant
We were born like this, my friends
In the battlefield of the body
If the Soul does not rise up
Suppressed it lives, unfree
Names are just another trick
To make you feel secure
Often it is the protoplasm they mean
And evidenced by a picture
Go beyond names and forms
To find the essence of the soul
Now you know why it must be done
Soul existence to unfold
