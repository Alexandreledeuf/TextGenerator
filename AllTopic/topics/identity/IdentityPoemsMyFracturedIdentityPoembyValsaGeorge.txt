After years of aimless wanderings
Leaving behind the cities of midnight revels
And the fevered journey in metro rails,
I am back at the land of my people.
My land, I had carried
Wherever I went,
Under which ever roof I slept
As a jewel in a casket
And ensured it rested safe
Ever under my pillow
Moving with aliens
Unable to merge with their cultural mores
I saw my land glimmer in darkness
Like dew drop on a moon blanched leaf
When I sweated in the blistering sands
That patch of green landscape, like an oasis
Wafted me in a cool embrace
Then dreams poured in like star light
And I wandered in the meadows of my youthful love
My heart struggling to forget old longings
And memories lashing upon me like tidal waves
Pursued by an inalienable shadow
Suddenly being born in flesh and blood
I hastened to the streets of my youth
With hopes galore and plans vivid
But alas! There is none to recognize me
Oh! I am a stranger here
An unwelcome stranger among total strangers
Now I wonder which really is my land
The one left behind or the one just landed in
Oscillating between these two worlds
My fractured identity looms large
With worms of memories wriggling in my flesh
And a myth dying in my brain
