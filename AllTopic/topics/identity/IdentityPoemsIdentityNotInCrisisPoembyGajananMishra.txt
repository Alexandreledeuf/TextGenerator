Identity crisis
My identity is intact, see.
Here is my knowledge
And my real position, see.
Actually I am not lost
Though I am lost.
False identification is
of no use, see.
I am a living entity
I can never be lost.
I am not thinking
What I am not.
Actually I am lost
And my identity is intact.
