Identity please security do ask
As you show them your identity pass
They look at it letting you through
But its that plastic card really you
That snapshot image of your face
Is not what your identity makes
Your true Identity is much more complex
Something a mere image doesn’t reflects
The way you care or feel is part of you
Your inner soul we hope keeps you true
Perhaps you have a real gift
Or maybe others spirits you do lift
It’s the way you laugh and joke
Or the way you give others hope
Perhaps its that you fight so hard
Or that no one can ever beat u at cards
Or that you are a great cook
Identity is not just how you do look
Its how you act think what you find true
That’s the identity of being you
