A hidden terrorism,
Without an iota of shame-
This vile plagiarism-
More than stealing a name.
A written poem or story
Is a writer's signature
Stealing it is very
Viciously impure.
For taking on another
Person's work of art
Is like robbing him of self
Taking out his heart.
Putting on his person,
It's identity theft!
Whatever is your reason
I hope you end up deaf.
(And blind too.)
''Do not fret because of evil men, or be envious of the wicked,
for the evil man has no future hope, and the lamp of the wicked
will be snuffed out.'
Proverbs 24: 19-20
