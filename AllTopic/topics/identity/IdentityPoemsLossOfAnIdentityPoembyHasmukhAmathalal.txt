Loss of identity
Greed has poisoned
War hawks has reasoned
More countries should come under heel
Say yes for yes and surrender at will
There is rise of new kind of nationalism
Like china, they profess spread of communism
"Power grows out of the barrel of gun"
The administration may automatically run
The fundamentalist has another concept
They have added bloodbath in their acts
They blast at populated places
Create terror and spread fears
Those days have gone
When people use to come out in streets and shown
Black flags for their non acceptance
Now where is leadership who has nationalist sense?
Now it is family who wants to rule
Nawaz Sheriff* has been convicted for corruption
Tejaswi Yadav* has been shown door
Many more are awaited for ouster
Preference and discrimination must stop
The students must rise to the top
They must be provided carrier and opportunity
Today there is danger of losing identity
Nawaz Sheriff….. Prime Minister of Pakistan
Tejaswi Yadav…. Deputy Chief Minsiter of U.P.
