I am known to some
Who do not know me
Some claim to know me
Yet do not know me.
Mysterious is the connection
Yours and mine
Like roots of trees intertwined
beneath the ground
Claimed by each tree above
As its own.
Roots understand it all!
Whatever I call mine
Isn't really mine
What I do not think as mine
Embraces me with such love.
Who thou are that walk by me?
