I  lOST  MY  IDENTITY
Believe me! I lost entity of my own shadow
When I followed shadows of so - called greats.
Sometimes Nietzsche ruled my fresh mind
Sometime Jesus appeared to rectify them.
I intend to perceive myself as Buddha
But my behaviour favoured Hitler then.
Do their souls embody inside me?
Or my own soul is dead alive then
I gaze at my own plain mirror
I can't find reflection of mine.
I'm searching myself inside me
But not capable to find out yet.
Shall I manage for meditation
Or need to seek for revolution.
I need to visualise myself inside me
To establish  myself as an unique me.
I need to preserve my fresh image
To ensure my own precious identity.
