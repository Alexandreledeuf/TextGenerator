Identity, fragile image of broken mirrors
The start of hope and banished fears
Razor time cuts into the innocence
Fallen gardens of an empires deluge
Travel the stars in moonlit sin
Identity is a strange foreign land
Reflections of solitude beneath the mask
Rainy night pounds with thunder
Identity is an endless hunger
