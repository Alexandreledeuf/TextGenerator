Simple identity
Use word as lover
And act as admirer
No killer or any other word
Suits for the beautiful thing of lord
You may not forget
The gift you got
From almighty the powerful
You are so much grateful
You are peace ambassador
Simple massager
And carrier
With beautiful message as known lover
Love transmits disease
And ceases
Your concentration
To go in one direction
That is sign of love
If you believe
It has powerful beam
And directs all of them
Love hides no one
But brings as one
With simple identity
And strong affinity
