We have no special identity but are one
It is accepted and denied by none
Still we involve and cross
Create the hurdles across
Forget the humanity
So much thrust for hostility
Shall we pray for fine out come?
Under one shed all are welcome
Blood is always thick and red
W are made to believe and fed
All untruths about worldly affairs
Nothing stands for good as fair
Shall we not abide by Divine dictates?
Does it not stand for anything good to indicate?
We still keep our selves in blind condition
Don’t miss any chance for providing ignition
Nothing prevents us from doing the good
It must be seen and clearly understood
We may be left behind in isolation
If we don’t keep up in tune or with relation
It moves on as per schedule
There is no prepared module
It may go on endlessly
We need not bother and go after it needlessly
It is reprieve from Him and very temporary
We must adhere to certain things and it is necessary
The life is precious and must be taken care of
It may not help you any time even if you cry wolf
Love to spend it in descent way and manner
At the end you will definitely be the gainer
It is natural law that every action has got reaction
There will be suitable reward for good action
Nothing goes unnoticed or unheeded
His blessings are always needed
We may not be able to move a single inch
Try for the good deal and clinch
