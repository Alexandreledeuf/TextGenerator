My dream as a child
Became a passion in my youth
To search for my identity
And search for a truth
I differentiated myself from every other mortal
I differentiated myself for a subtle known cause
To be the best amongst all of them
And to prevent my identity loss
The great that I achieved
Doesn’t seem to be any more
Or probably it wasn’t great enough
For my conscience to be sure
I was probably the most competitive
In an effort to establish my superiority
I’m still to reach that ultimate position
To re-establish the mistaken identity
I would stand nowhere
If they all fall in my shoes
My identity is mistaken for nothing
Don’t know for the fault of whose.
