Listen identity
my name was chosen
by my parents
before I came
and after birth
a note was bound
at my toe what a shame
My parents
called my name
and my heart beats
but I was a human
without an ID-card
also when I fall asleep
My identity
is not my passport
not my name
not my land
not what I write
with my free hands
My identity
is not my color
not my size
not my language
or my character
even not my price
My identity
is not my dental filling
my eye color
or my hair
not my fingerprint
my job or my salary
My identity
is different
from me
because it is
given
to separate me
Separates me
from girls and boys
even from twins
and natural
toys
Separates me
from religions
politics and class
is written
in my document of birth
and my testament at last
This identity
is given by state
to control
where I am
even to find me
paying no toll
But my own
identity is my life
are my parents
is my wife
are my children
and my friends
my identity
IS
the promised land
is the playground of my soul.
