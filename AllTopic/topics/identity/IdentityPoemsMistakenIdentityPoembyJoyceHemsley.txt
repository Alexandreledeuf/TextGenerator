He was all out of luck, the chips were down
On the day he walked through London Town,
When out of the corner of his eye he spotted
His true-love - with another guy!
Turning his head, he just walked away
He would think about this another day...
Like Scarlett O'Hara, he knew the score,
When chips were down it was love no more.
He hurried home and guess who was there;
His own true-love, in her favourite chair.
She'd waited for hours. How wrong could he be?
'Mistaken Identity' so foolish was he.
