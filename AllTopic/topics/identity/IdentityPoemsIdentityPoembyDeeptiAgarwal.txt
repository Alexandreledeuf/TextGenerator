In the crowd of this creation
Who is ours and who is not?
For a moment, felt someone known
The next moment he was gone..
Dreamt of that deep faith
Which disappeared as the droplet..
Do we recognize ourselves
In our conscious mirror?
Need  to keep ourselves protected
In the crowd, to save us
From Being lost!
