Identity is not what I promise others
Identity is what I do when I am alone
Identity is what I think of others
Knowing all the hatred they've shown
Identity is what I make out of my given chance
Identity is what I accept and what I deny
No one else has control over me
Life is about me, and what I identify
Identity is what every wound reminds me
Identity is what I learn and what I pass by
Identity is what I see in the mirror
After giving my best try
But this mirror shows a reflection
of a mind that wavers thin
along the line
that savours pain
my friends and fam keep saying to me
behind the surface
we know its you
its you we know
we know your through
we know your done man, your gone
But thats not what I believe
I just got lost on the way
I know I can
untie these hands
and find my way again
To my real identity
Full of entity
its just this mirror staring back at me
I keep telling it
Mirror, mirror
Surly you do lie.
We don’t see eye to eye.
Your image is surly haunting.
My self-esteem you’re taunting
Are you showing my insides?
Why cant you give me pride?
It really ain't fair
I cant help but stop and stare
Now you’re smashed in thousands
A thousand me’s surrounding
look at me
it's not my true identity
Your showing me that I have a covert identity,
i wonder if you'd ever see,
my thoughts, my deeds
are all that makes me
but something I may do
may not describe me.
My true identity
has fled me,
fled me to another
to my friends and family
my true identity
is all that makes me.
So lost deep inside
if its not for my soul
i would be lost again
my true identity
is hard to see.
My message is to
Accept who you are
recognize your own beauty
identity isn't a need,
your identity should be your own
a better person you will be known
this is me, this is my identity
my true identity is all full of beauty and entity
