I'm changing.
Yes I know my face is the same
So is my name
And I'm still only partially sane,
But I'm changing.
I found true beauty.
It's always been in front of me
But I guess I was to blind to see.
And I'm happy.
I never understood why they cry when they read the words.
I never understood why a rock meant such worth.
I never understood why they prepare for the worst.
Now look at me.
One chapter and I'm teary.
I stand five times but don't grow weary.
I guess it's because I found me,
My true identity.
