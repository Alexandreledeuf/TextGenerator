This is to the motherland,
Where I am born.
This is to the teacher,
Who taught me nothing.
This is to my lover,
Who turned away from me.
Many are there to address,
Very few to notice.
What have you taught me?
Why the hell you came in?
Why did I even open my eyes mother!
Hybridity, Modernization, Temporary.
Yes, You all have lost me,
Lost your identity in my life.
Dedicated to the ones who have lost their identity.
