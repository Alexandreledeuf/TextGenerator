Oh! Cinderella the beautiful girl
Perhaps we are not knowing each other
But trying to remember always
But forgot to achieve my memory
Oh! Cinderella the little one
The hardships you faced well known
The crooked mind tried to destroy
The hook nose of your enemy there
Whom you fear for your ill fortune.
Oh! Cinderella a noble minded girl
Ever we are for your support here
Never mind of the devils attempts
The world is always love with you.
