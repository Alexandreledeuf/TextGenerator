Cinderella the cute girl
Cinderella the poor girl
The kind full heart there have
The noble thoughts always
Still there were enemies
The poor Cinderella wandered
Chased by the devils
Grace of god protected
Demons made there traps
God saved from dangers
Poor Cinderella have no death
Wandering for well being
Of the living Cinderellas
In countries beyond her reach
Warning to safety ways she cares
Cinderella a symbol of love
Cinderella a sign of hardship
Cinderella a victim always
Still triumphed on her love
Faced the life challenges
And got married to the prince.
