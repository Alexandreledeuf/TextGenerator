If I was Cinderella would you love me?
Would you pick me up in a gold carriage and dance with me till midnight?
When I run, will you never give up, and chase after me just to give me a passionate kiss?
Will you marry me the next day, saying that you found your one and true love?
Will you make me feel special, and shower me with love and support that any man should give to his women?
But, that won't happen.
Because I'm not Cinderella. I'm not Cinderella, because I won't have anyone that will love me enough to drive me in a golden carriage, or chase after me when I get to scared to commit to anyone. I won't have anyone that will marry me the next day, because they know that I'm their one and true love. I won't have anyone who will dance with me till midnight, because I'm just that special.
I wont have anyone to give me that passionate kiss.
To give me, that passionate kiss.
