Cinderella the beautiful girl
I saw in my dreams
she was flying in a flying saucer
Looking the universe in curiosity
Striking the events of universe
From star to star she tried to reach
The flying saucer glittered in nights
That I saw in my eyes
Cinderella looking the planets
The beautiful earth, mars and all
The life breath facility in saucer
Technology were so superior to man
She felt no thirst or hunger in journey
She was blessed with gods will
Beautiful cinderella always prayed
In journeys she remembered the humans
The fellow people who loved her
The affection of her beloved mother
The fairy made problems to her
The lovable prince's charm she thought
The well ridden poems in human mind
Cinderella can read the minds prettily
Just like human computers in action
The stars, moons of different types
Different worlds, different live systems
Poor cinderella became blessed one
She got a place near the planets
For ever she looks to the earth she came
She shined and glittered like jewels
Where there is no prince, or paupers
The world of contentment only there
Where material gain is not a concern
In fact cinderella is a great enlightened
The nobility of a great human being
And an Angel's beauty and clarity in her
The flying saucer ever ready to carry
Cinderella the beautiful girl ever ready
To go from planets to planets and stars
Above oceans, mountains, and hillocks
To proclaim the noble feelings of love
The essential teachings of love she carries
The flying saucer superior to all
The loving mind ever superior to all
We can farewell cinderella for her journey
Till attaining the kindness in all creatures.
