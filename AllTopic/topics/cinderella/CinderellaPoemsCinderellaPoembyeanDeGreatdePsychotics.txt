It's raining out there, would you mind to join me?
Lets play in the rain, we'll laugh and dance till the rain's over.
It's 11: 16 pm right now, the clock will strikes to 12 soon.
Oh, I wish I'm Cinderella, I just need to end all this stupid act.
Come on, let dance with me till the song's over.
Before the rains stop, please can you be my prince?
I just love to dance in the rain, because in that way, you'll never notice me crying.
