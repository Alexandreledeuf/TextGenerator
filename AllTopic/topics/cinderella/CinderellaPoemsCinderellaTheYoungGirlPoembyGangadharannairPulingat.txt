Cinderella the young one
Her story a tragic one
written by hearsay
Turned to be a moral one.
Cinderella the beautiful
Cinderella the marvelous
Cinderella have no comparison
Gods grace showered in her
But tested with bad events.
Cinderella the luckier one
Saved from the wicked ones
Got one the great prince
The prince himself charming
The prince himself good looking
Ever pride to the dignified girl
Cinderella the young girl
From curse to blessing she became.
