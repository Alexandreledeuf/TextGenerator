Cinderella got lost
somewhere in between
the countryside and palace
that she'd never seen.
Walking through mud,
face streaked with tears
still clearly so beautiful,
the slippers were clear.
But soon she got covered
in the worst kinds of things
and she didn't understand
what marriage would mean.
She had no conception
of being the queen,
so she met a young beggar
and settled, for him.
They lived in a hovel
right outside town;
she'd watch the processions
of royals going down.
She often wondered
how it might feel
to sit on a throne
(it gave her a thrill!) .
As she tended the fire
and sat in the cinders
she would dream of a life
with riches unending.
The end.
