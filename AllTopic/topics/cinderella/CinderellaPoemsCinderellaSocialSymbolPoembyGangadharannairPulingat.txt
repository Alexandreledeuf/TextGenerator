Cinderella a great social symbol
Stood for service to fellow humans
Family woman stood with her
Rights issues took by Cinderella
Took the cases to courts of justice.
Organised the woman for empowerment
Education were her favorite theme
The little girl she persuaded to school
The Poor girls she gave books and bags
Cinderella the great girl of friendship
The neighbors respected ever in pride
She was a brave, had strong will power
Seldom shown mercy to the abusers.
Cinderella herself had a chosen carrier
The human psychology she graduated
Counselling made to the woman in village
Where she tried her best to raise the respect
That deserved the woman in public life.
