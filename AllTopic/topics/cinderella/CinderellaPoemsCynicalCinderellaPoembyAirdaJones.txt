So this is love?
Is this what they told me of?
Because I don't feel the connection
And where it is going, which direction
So this is what makes life worth while?
Has it always been this style?
How is it to fill the empty spaces
If I cannot even see its true faces
So this is love?
I don't feel that it is enough
Because my heart can't fly with wings
And my heart hasn't found the song its to sing
So this s the warmth of aglow?
Well, I don't think that I know
That Heaven is as divine
And I can tell that it will never be mine
So this...
Is the miracle that I've been dreaming of?
So this...
Is love? ...
