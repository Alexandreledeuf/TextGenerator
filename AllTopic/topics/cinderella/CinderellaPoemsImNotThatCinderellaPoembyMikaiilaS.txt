I'm not that Cinderella, ,
I’m not right all the time,
And I’m not gonna sit in a cold, dusty old attic,
Just Waiting and waiting for that someone to come and find me.
And then one day I realized,
The fariytale life just isnt the life for me.
I'm not that Cinderella.
I know that one day will be the day I'll find someone who loves me,
who needs me,
Who wants me for my heart and soul,
and not just a pretty face,
and he’s isn’t scared to show that he loves me.
A one who will see
that I’m pleased who I am,
I’m not that Cinderella.
I can chase my own Monsters,
Out of my room.
I Can dream my own dreams,
But maybe not accomplish them.
And my knight in shining armour,
Is upto me.
I'm not that Cinderella.
I don't wanna be like anyone else,
I wanna be an individual,
Not like the pretty girls you see in the story books,
JUST ME (:
I'm not that Cinderella.
