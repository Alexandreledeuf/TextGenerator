where are her little helpers
those nice little mice
why is she so alone in it all
where is her fairy god mother
to say 'poof' and it all be gone
she needs a break
she needs for once to care for herself
when will she get to meet her prince
one that will sweeep her off her feet
will love her for who she is
she may not have to ugly step sisters
or a evil step mom
but she has an evil step dad
and distant mother
both with anger problems
i would call it even
she fights to calm her mind
as she dreams of the singing butterflies
she needs to escape
she needs to get away
that is it magic or not
she is packing up her pumpkin
and leaving
good bye
farewell
have a nice life
she cries
with an evil grin
as she rides away
in her half broken pumpkin
