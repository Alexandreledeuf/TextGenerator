Cinderella the dear girl
The fondness of love you gave
The unselfish gestures to guests
The great wishes of you
Ever it is pleasure to remember
Curses followed you but never minded
Attempts to destroy the future
Never minded, but always cried
The god saved you at last
You got your loved one the prince
The great achievement for your life
Cinderella the kindness in your heart
Love the children and the world
Humanity in your words always
Pleasantness in your feelings followed
Ignorance never minded
Attentive to the  people whom you care
The world is with you poor girl
Not as a victim but a successful heart.
