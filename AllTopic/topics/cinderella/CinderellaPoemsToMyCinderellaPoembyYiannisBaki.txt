I want to drink the ocean to come to you
I want to give you the kiss the one you need
I want to wake you up from endless sleep
To teach you Poisoned apples not to eat
I m in love with the powers of your words
Climbing in my desert like gorgious dolls
I don't know the colour of your eyes
But when I see the moon I feel their light
