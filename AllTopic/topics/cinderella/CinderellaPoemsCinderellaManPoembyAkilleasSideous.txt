You are the Cinderella and
I want to be the man  to take your hand and help
you stand to be your man in all the land
the glass has fallen from your foot and
when I find it that’s when I find you to make it fit
I hope it do to hold you I want to but to lose
you is coming too I know its life
and that for me is almost through
but once it’s over I hope that you are happy too,
when you leave me I will know it’s through and
all I will have left to say to you is
I bid you a due and I love you to
