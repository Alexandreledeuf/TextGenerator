[to my Grandmother, with love]
we are the queen of nooks and crannies,
she sparkled, pulling a raisin bun from the air
with pink frosting on it?
you have to come prepared, she said
then a can of pink frosting appeared
on a lower shelf with a butter knife
I never saw before in my life.
and we had tea, deliciously who cares
what anyone else thinks.
plenty to drink of cherry fizz
or raspberry glitz or anything else
if you think of it, chilled, on chipped ice;
be nice and don't dawdle.
but dawdling is what the day is for
we both agree when it's green outdoors;
an April green and a wind that blows
and we are the very rose that blows
my fairy Goddear and I;
two twinkles in God's eye.
