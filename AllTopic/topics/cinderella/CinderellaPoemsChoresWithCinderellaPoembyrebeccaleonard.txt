Cinderella!
I need your crummy clothes cleaned.
First, make sure you have every stain off them.
You need to look decent tonight for the guests.
Next, Hang dry them so that they do not bleed into the other clothes.
I do not need you to have anymore bright blue shirts.
Last, Put them away.
Flor them so that the creeses match up.
And place them into your drawers
