There I saw a beautiful girl
In the little street of the town
In shabby dressed, the girl seen
In speedy steps she was walking
But somewhere in fear she seemed
The time was evening nearing dark
The night was slowly taking place
The girl was in busy walk in street
The girl is beyond the reach of eye
Where I mistaken for cinderella the girl.
