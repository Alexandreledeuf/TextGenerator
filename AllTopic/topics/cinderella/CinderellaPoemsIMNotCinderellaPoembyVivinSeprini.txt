This bell ring spread a beautiful memories
About a girl who tried to catch a little dream
Unfortunely she found herself in a middle of
Life that she couldn’t spend without perseverance
She now close her heart to anybody else
Then a charming prince come to lend a hand
To a poor little girl who couldn’t feel
Love or happiness she’s hard to believe in
I’m not Cinderella or any princess else
She said
I’m not live or wait for white horse mounts
I’m not want to love or be loved
That’s not a thing like I could hand on
Everyday till past I live in the heavy rain
And I don’t need you to give me a sunshine
I’m not cry or hurt at night
Don’t stand on your own mind! ! ! !
I’m not Cinderella or any princess else
Not that time or this time
Waiting for true love?
Don’t say a mess
But yes she used to dream as one
Wear a white dress with a man who stand
Right beside her
Carrying her hand
Then they kissed
Live happy ever after
But
I’m not Cinderella or any princess else
I will love without be loved
And only lost
To a beauty dream like you just appear
And if I give you my heart you will tear it apart
But
I’m not Cinderella or any princess else
No love story will tell in my midnight tale
