Cinderella a woman of thoughts
A woman of brave and questioning mind
Stood for education and empowerment
Never brawled but a bravura in actions.
Cinderella had grown to woman hood
Facing all challenges to the girls
Still faced them in her style of brave
No one had courage to face her challenges.
She was not a bravado someone suspected
She was a hero in circumstances warranted
A valiant girl fought for justice
Never she minded the cowards opposing progress.
