A light like yours can lead me home.
A body warm inside my arms.
A fantasy so alive, made of flesh and bone.
A voice of warmth, a scent of light.
The taste of sunshine and the sound of your sight.
Might just be enough to save my mind.
If only once again I can find.
Cinderella dressed in white.
Standing next to me tonight
