The clock has just struck one.
Have you seen Cinderella tonight?
Was she ever real?
Lost in the mist
Of lies and deception,
Hidden in the shadows
Where she used to feel safe,
With the aid of a secret Godmother,
Her ghost tries to find the light.
And as the moon is chased by the sun
Magic is replaced by reality
And all again are plain
And ordinary
And lifeless.
Tomorrow night
Her withered spirit
Will try once more to find her prince.
She believes that dreams are
Our pathway to magic
And I am definite that
Fairy tales end only when
We allow them to.
