She takes in a breath as the roaring sun sets
And watch shadows fade into faint silhouettes
The smell of melted pink candles filled the air
As she sat beside Zeus in His mighty chair
The burning cold air caressed her long, black hair
Unraveling a night so mysteriously fair
As she takes a last sip from her iced champagne
She felt the forsaken blood run through her vein
Foolishly struggling and trying to keep sane
From all the anxiousness it cannot contain
She will try to set her tainted spirit free
She will try to find the secret garden's key
And sail briskly amidst the Aegean sea
Though trapped within William Shakespeare's tragedy
