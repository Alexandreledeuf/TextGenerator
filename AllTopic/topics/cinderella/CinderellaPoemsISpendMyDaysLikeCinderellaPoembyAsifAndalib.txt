I spend my days like Cinderella
I want a prince of America
I love to dance like Cinderella
I want to live in America
I squeeze my pillow at night
Thinking of holding him tight
In my arms and in my bed
Why God acts like He is dead
I change the channel of TV
May be He is in the movie
I look for him in the web
But I find nowhere my babe
I have waited for so long
To write and sing a love song
Only for him for the dance
So no one else stand a chance
