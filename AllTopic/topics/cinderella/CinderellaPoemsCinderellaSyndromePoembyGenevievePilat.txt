Every girl has once fell victim
Of the Cinderella Syndrome
Where her dreams and fantasies wonder around
And have a tendency to roam.
She dreams of a life with a step-mother and sisters
Who treat her so cruel and mean
But then she’s saved by a magic Godmother
And becomes the most beautiful ever seen.
With a gown so beautiful and slippers of glass
She quickly heads out to the ball
And there she dreams the Prince will see her
And think she’s the fairest of all.
And then she’ll dream of dancing with the Prince
And be in treasured bliss
Knowing that their love will soon come true
Once they share that infamous kiss.
Yet midnight strikes and now the carriage
Is a pumpkin from the change
But she knows the ending of this fairytale
And knows her dream won’t rearrange.
But she does not have that glass slipper
To prove the shoe did fit
And her dream of ever being with the Prince
Is now only a counterfeit.
And yet young girls keep dreaming on
Without knowing the actuality
That glass slippers, and Princes and true loves
Will never be a reality.
