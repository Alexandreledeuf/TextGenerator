Once some children
Said to Grandmother,
"Please tell us a story
We are in wait no bother."
Grandmother with a smile
In her rosy lip,
Began to tell a fairy tale
She sat on a chair hip.
She said about Cinderella
Whom people do ignore,
"Here is a story of orphan girl
She never feels bore."
Her name was Lucy
She had four brothers,
She had moral qualities
She was helping to others.
The brothers went on
A long journey for trade,
The wives ordered Lucy
To went with goats to glade.
There Lucy made the goats
Grazing, she was about to ruin,
A prince came near her
And he made her queen.
They took farewell from sisters-in laws
And they came back to kingdom,
There with all Lucy lived happily
She did get more freedom.
Lucy was moral in character
She was praying God,
God helps those creatures
Who pray him and nod.
Prince recognized the quality
And inner beauty of her,
Here Cinderella vanished
And they lived like Zur.
