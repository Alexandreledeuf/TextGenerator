I am not Cinderella
I am not beautiful in every way
I do not have malevolent family members
I do not have a prince
I do not have a fairy god-mother
I am not a silent, graceful girl
I am exceptional
I have my disfigurements
I have kindhearted family members
I have a bread boy
I have a guardian spirit
I am a clamorous, unrefined woman
I am not Cinderella
For me, I am unique.
