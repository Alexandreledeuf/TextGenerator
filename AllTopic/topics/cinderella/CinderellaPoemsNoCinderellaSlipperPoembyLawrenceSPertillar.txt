Wrongs to commit them.
Are wrongs to commit. Period!
And there is no Cinderella slipper,
Going to fit the magnitude of that foot.
No matter who attempts to push,
That agenda.
In the hope the misdeeds done,
Will minimize the size of what has happened.
To depict the doer,
As a victim of mistaken identity.
Maybe in another fairytale to tell.
And that slipper is replaced,
With a distribution of medication...
To erase all misdeeds,
Witnessed to have taken place.
Deluding a sunken boat rises to the surface.
With no one to remember,
The many moons and midnights to pass.
Hoping to convince what is observed,
Rising to float upon the surface...
Is nothing more,
Than an innocent empty pumpkin.
To have been accused for horrendous activities.
And...
Leaving this deception,
Bought and sold.
By those on the highest of 'highs',
The telling to accept lies will get them!
