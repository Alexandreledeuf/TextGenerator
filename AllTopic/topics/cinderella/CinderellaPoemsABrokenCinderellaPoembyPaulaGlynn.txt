Like a broken Cinderella,
She turns in the jewellery box,
There is no exit, no escape, no hope,
And she is hanging from a noose rope.
Broken Cinderella, broken Cinderella,
You're over; a broken record,
That cannot play, pain here to stay,
No prettiness to escape to,
No moving forward, only moving back,
Trapped, dead, deceased, over and broken,
With a torn dress, a torn gown,
That is ripped at the seams,
Ripped in her agony, she searches,
But can find no one with a solution.
Her shoes, long since worn out,
Leave her walking a lonely road,
Almost crawling on the ground,
Her heart an empty, cold stone,
With many heavy stones in the load.
She wishes for mercy from the hot sun,
She wished for mercy from the cold snow,
Where is the window? she asks,
Where is my future? A broken Cinderella,
Broken, down and out,
Living all by herself,
With no helping hand,
With no friend or stranger to understand.
And she yearns to be fixed,
She hopes to replace those bricks,
That will make her a new home,
A world where her heart carries no stone,
And leaves her to fly in the blue sky,
Her wings carrying her,
From the unforgiving ground.
