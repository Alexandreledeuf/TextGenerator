Why looking blue today
Whatâ€™s the matter with you?
Where is Prince Charming?
Who are looking for now?
How you could have done this?
The teardrops fall tonight
Lost without a care to fight
Blowing in the wind now
Are the dreams you left
Your hearts in you hands
Slipping away till falls
Shattered it to pieces
Trying to put it back
With what is left of you
Thinking is there anything else
That I could do now
I wished it all a way
Here I am sitting here
Looking at shooting stars
Getting lost as I am
