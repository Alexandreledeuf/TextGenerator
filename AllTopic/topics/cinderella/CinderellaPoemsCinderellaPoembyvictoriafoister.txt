Amidst a darkened night
lay a dreadful sight,
inside a pumpkin;
she made her home.
Abandoned by her family
a stray in society.
She wears a torn, blue dress
her body- now straw
with stiches tearing apart her sides.
Once she was beautiful,
a prince would marry her any day.
But poor Cinder's never got the chance
Cinderella missed the dance.
Her fairy god mother was a deceiver
now only a rat would kiss her.
Her glass slippers full of cracks
her smile is cracked.
She missed the deadline as the clock struck ten.
Cinder's thought she had till twelve,
but the doors where closed, of the house she used to call home.
Her  eye's turned to buttons, all on their own
Cinderella had the pay the price.
So the fairy took her soul
she became a doll with a story- she was a so called fairy tale.
Used to wreak havoc on us humans and to manipulate our dreams.
