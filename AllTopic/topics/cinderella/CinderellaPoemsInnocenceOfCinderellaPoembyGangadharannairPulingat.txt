Don't be afraid of, cinderella
The girl of truth, and nicety
The little one, the joyful one
Where innocence in mind
Energetic in actions
Cinderella, the girl loved by all.
But poor cinderella the poor girl
The devils always followed her
Tried to do damages in full spirit
But her faith always stood with her
She got her prince the most loved one
The noble hearts always wins.
