Is Cinderella leading a happy life with her dearest prince still,
hand in hand, heading towards the same destination?
She knows how to eat with a fork made of gold?
She finds the silver cup to heavy to hold?
She ever fails to meet his expectation?
Can the loneliness her happiness kill?
She has a friend to talk to?
......
Yes, she should be happy,
she must be happy,
for I have provided her the best life a girl can possibly have,
and I have given her my every care to turn her into a real princess.
The prince said with confidence.
But is she still Cinderella?
