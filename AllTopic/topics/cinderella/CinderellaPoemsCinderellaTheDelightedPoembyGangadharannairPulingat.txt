Delight you cinderella
The world of joy there we see
The world of hope we expect
The world of peace there will be
Rejoice, my sister cinderella
Never we desperate and disillusioned
There is glittering shines ahead
There is helping hands surrounded
There we see the lifeboats when drowns
The needy man have no pride at all
The needy hand always never tires
Cinderella the little one
The great human heart god's bless
Ever you will win never fail
You are the hope, you are genuine
The symbol of unity oh! Cinderella.
