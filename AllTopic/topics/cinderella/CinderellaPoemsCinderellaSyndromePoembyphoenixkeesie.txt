i have this disease, it
makes you think there
is happiness and that
there is no wrong done i the
world
it makes you belive that
you can be happy all the
time
that someome will take
you away from this hell hole
that your asleep and
just having a bad dream, and
that youll wake up and
everything will be perfect.
i have this disease
and its called
Cinderella-syndrom.
