Cinderella means the personality or beauty of a person,
Or things remain unrecognized in real and in version.
In our society there are some talented and wise people,
Some of them come to the knowledge of nation in ample.
There are some extraordinary children in our society,
Who can dance, sing and play on music in variety
Of course mass media brings some to our eyes,
Till in remote area few lads are left in rise.
There are some medicinal plants till now unrecognized,
Animals cure themselves by using these plants recognized.
Society develops through the person with strong personality,
They must come to our eyes that have the perfect morality.
Let's try to find them and to vanish of Cinderella,
Make hay while the sun shines or keeps in rain an umbrella.
