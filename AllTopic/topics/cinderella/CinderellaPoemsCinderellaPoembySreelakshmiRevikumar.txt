Pierced the Rays of mighty sun-
To wake her up from slumber.
With head weighing like a ton,
She awaited for the thunder.
Shouts came, heavy steps in follow
Cleared her face, as slept near hearth.
Prepared she for yet another blow,
Calmness and patience she taught
And everyone called her Cinderella.
