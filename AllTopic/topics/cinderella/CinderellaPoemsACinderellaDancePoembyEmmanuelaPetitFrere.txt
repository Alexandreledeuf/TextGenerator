When we first met it was at  a mask dance party
We only dance once
but last a lifetime
It was a magical time
Even thought we never saw each other face
But you remember how beautiful I dance
I know I left without saying goodbye
And I'm glad you've been looking for me since
Because one song bring two strangers together
And one dance make two stranger fall in love with each other
Baby You are my Cinderella
And I can tell you if we can find each other after all those years
And if one dance make us fall in love
We are going to live happily ever after
The truth is that it wasn't just a dance It  was
A Cinderella Dance
