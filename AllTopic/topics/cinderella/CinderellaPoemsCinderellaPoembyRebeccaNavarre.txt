Pretty as a flower. Wild as a rose. Free as
a raven, off into the skies she goes. Dancing
until midnight. Till her eyes tire and close.
Then off into wonderful dreams, she does dose.
Cheerful and bright. A little bit too daring,
compassionate and caring. Her dinners are a
delight. As she slips into her ball gown, her
carriage awaits out under the, moonlight. And
any man would be lucky, to be her knight! ! !
