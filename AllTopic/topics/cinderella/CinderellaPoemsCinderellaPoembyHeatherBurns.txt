Father met a lovely lady,
She had two daughters one
was crazy
Father and daughter went
to stay
In a mansion far away
Father turned ill one cold
day
everyone bowed their heads
to pray
Stepmother turned into a
witch
along with daughters became
a bitch
Cinderella was their slave
She stood tall tired and
brave
Cinderella's friends were very
few
she knew exactly what to do
Take care of stepmother
sister too
work and work till day is
thru
One day a messenger came to
call
inviting all girls to a ball
The prince was home it was
getting late
girls meet him at the kingdoms
gate
He was looking for his wife to
be
the King also wanted to see
The ugly sisters gowns were
fine
Cinderella thought where is
mine
Her little friends and two
field mice
thought about her problem
twice
We'll make a gown for our
friend to wear
she'll be beautiful ever so
fair
So the friendly sewing circle
began
sewing A lovely satin band
stepsisters started to contrive
to destroy her gown never to
arrive
Her fairy Godmother came in
view
She knew exactly what to do
Touched her with a magic wand
a fabulous gown she put on
Dressed in her stunning gown
of white
Cinderella was a pure delight
Waiting for her carriage of
gold
her future was about to unfold.
