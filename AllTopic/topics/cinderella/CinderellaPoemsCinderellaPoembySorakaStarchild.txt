She was the Cinderella
waiting for her prince charming,
but soon enough
she finallly found him.
She always doubted
he was the one,
and that he would leave her
for someone better,
even when he called her perfect
and that there was no one else
to take her place.
He was the prince charming
looking for his Cinderella
and he found her.
He would give her a look
followed by a gentle smile,
then a kiss.
He loved her
no matter how much she doubted him.
He knew they would be together forever.
