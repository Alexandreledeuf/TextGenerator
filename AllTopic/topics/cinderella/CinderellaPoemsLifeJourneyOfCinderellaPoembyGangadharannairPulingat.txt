Cinderella the girl
The village grown
Neither fairy nor devilish
Only a village girl
An innocent human girl.
Cinderella a serious student
Tried hard to achieve goals
To make herself to become a hero
In studies, sports, and arts
In singing her sound so melancholy
Our cinderella never failed.
Cinderella the girl pubescent
The mother told to neighbors
The women loved her very much
The beauty queen of the village
Cinderella never prided herself.
A humble and lovable human being
Cinderella helped the people
To make the illiterate literate
The inhuman  as a human being
Tried her best for welfare measures.
Still people cursed each other
Still people quarreled themselves
Tried to harm others feelings
Poor cinderella failed her attempts.
Then came a marriage proposal
The beauty of cinderella spread around
The prince came in picture
The devil made to block the proposal
But the prince adamant and decides
To marry the poor cinderella the humble.
She enjoyed the life with humility
Never boasted for her wealth or husband
Tried her best to do services
Liked the people rich or poor no matter.
A successful journey of life she followed.
