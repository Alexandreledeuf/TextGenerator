Dreaming
Every night
About holding you
In my arms
Your lips touching mine
In a never ending kiss
A promise of forever
With you by my side
My Prince Charming
That never did I think
In this world I would find
Flesh not fantasy anymore
That is my secret longing
To know you
To be held by you
Whispering
I love you and will never stop
Even after death
Nothing shall part us
If only
Fate would allow
I would be your Cinderella tonight
It's true
Yes, I have fallen in love with you
Sight unseen
Voice unheard
Heart and soul
How I long for you to be mine always
Praying
That soon we two shall find
The one thing we have always
Needed and hungered for
Tonight please lover come to your Cinderella
Writing this
So that you will know
I am here and I am waiting for you
Forever if I have to
I swear
Never will I stop trying to find you
The other half of my soul
The only man who can make me complete
God and I know you are out there
It is only a matter of time and fate before
Face to face we meet
Cinderella and her prince
Forever more
