A Prince's Dream
Slender slipper
Of a slippery antelope
Heart elopes
Sentience
Tiny toes
And heeled soles
A tinge of toe jam
Feet and Play
Tender soles
Woven in Assam silk
A prince's foot fetish
Smells Like Halloween
A slipper
Made of glass
Smelling of pumpkin
A Slipper Made Of Glass
Beyond misty mountains
Beyond the cover of oceans
Rests a transparent love
