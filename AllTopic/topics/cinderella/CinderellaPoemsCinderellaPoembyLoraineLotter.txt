If my name was Cinderella
You could be the prince
I could wear my sparkling prom dress
We could fall in love the moment our eyes meet
If my name was Cinderella
If my name was Cinderella
We could have a song
And dance in the silver moonlight
You could hold me tight and spin me in the air
If my name was Cinderella
If my name was Cinderella
You could pick me up
In your gold and diamond carriage
You could be the hero of this fairytale
And I could be the one
If my name was Cinderella
But I can’t breathe, whenever you’re with me.
Can you feel my heartbeat in my chest
It’s getting faster every second
Time slows down,  you are better than the best
But would you feel the same
If my name was Cinderella
I can’t breathe
‘Cause I’m not Cinderella
Until you’re here with me
I’m not Cinderella
You touch my lips
I’m not Cinderella
Then you show me with a kiss
That I’m your Cinderella
