I wish I could be you're Cinderella
I wish I could meet you at a ball and
You find my glass slipper and bring it back
Then sweep me off my feet
Take me away in that carriage
Let it just be you and I
Let me be your one and only princess
I want to be your Cinderella
Oh please let me be your one and only Cinderella
