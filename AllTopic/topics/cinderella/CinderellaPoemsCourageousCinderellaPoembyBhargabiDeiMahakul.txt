Once upon a time there was a daughter,
In family of merchant she was in laughter.
The time came she lost her both parents,
Thirteen brothers left one sister tenants.
All brothers were happy with sister-in-laws,
Family fell in maintenance of their clause.
Brothers were affectionate towards sister,
Love was unbending and love was their factor.
One day brothers went for business far place,
Sister played with friends to win life's race.
Sister-in-laws planned and tortured her more,
In absence of brothers she cried from her core.
Brother's wives sent her to forest with goats,
On grazing one was missed she fell in notes.
She cried in deep forest due to tiger lion fear,
Forgetting in path in pain she searched in cheer.
Soon she surrendered before supreme God,
In God's feet she poured devotion and did nod.
Fear went away; obstacles broke at a moment,
With courage moving in forest got goat comment.
Prayed God to forgive them to her sister-in-laws,
She urged God to free all from illusion's claws.
Victory of Cinderella, daughter of dead merchant
Even today people sing Gog's glory, verses chant.
