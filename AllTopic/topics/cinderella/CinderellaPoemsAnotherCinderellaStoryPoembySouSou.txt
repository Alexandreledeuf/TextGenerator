I still believe in Cinderella story.
And I am even worse.
There's no concept of time.
When your heart strikes '12 o'clock',
There will be a new pair of shoes for you.
Waiting for you to shine again.
There's no concept of time.
There will always be a new pair of shoes,
No matter how old you are, how ugly you are,
how unhappy you are.
Waiting for you to shine again.
