Oh!   Deep  Wide Ocean
You fill my black eyes in blue
Oh!  little waves who drive you
touching the shores beautifully fall back into
and confluence in you!
Big whales and little golden fishes
swim and sweep in you merrily
and I am on shore with endless joy
jump dance and sing
the friendly dophin unbelievable with humour
so high they jump and plunge in you!
How did the colour you reflect with
much delight beautiful bow in the sky
who painted above you
A jealous in me burn and plunge myself in you!
Oh! big ocean who reign you
you are filled with joy and blessed lives
All in you enjoying the freedom
slaveless life May God bless me
I born in you and confluence in you!
Oh! Ocean you are always gifted
you are blessed by thee you are big and wide
Oh! Ocean you are deep and wide! .......
