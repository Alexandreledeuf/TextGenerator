I am like the breeze on the ocean waves
Drinking from the breasts of the afar deep
Flowers from the glistening morning weep
And each of its longing that daybreak craves
Sun shining moods that flow around its spell
Weeping clouds in drifting its moments tears
Coming through the dreaming and the real years
Anything desiring I can't foretell
Rivers that feel the veins of softly earth
While it's going with its flowing rivulet
From side to side dust and its growing lime
Each thinking that catches me in its worth
Allows me to completely forget
What hour comes after this instant in time
