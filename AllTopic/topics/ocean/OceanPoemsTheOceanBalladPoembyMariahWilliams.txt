The waves caress my feet
The sun beams down upon me
And the birds sound ever so sweet
While we
Stare into the atmosphere
Without a care in our hearts
Taking in the air so clear
Observing natureâ€™s beautiful art
I touch your hand
And you smile at me
You lay your head upon the sand
And I giggle happily
The sky is clear
And the wind is pleasant
But night is almost hear
And the day's time is almost spent
We run into the sea
to waste the rest of our time
I wish you could come with me
And always be mine
You walk me home
And then say goodnight
I do not wish to be alone
But you are swiftly gone from my sight
That night my mind
Had oh so many notions
Of you, so many that I began to find
That you made puppet strings of my emotions
And that same connection
That I had with you
I also have with the ocean
The ocean, oh so very blue
