Can’t wait ‘till I’m gone, can rest in peace
Live forever without the stress and grief
Can’t push my feelings aside, I’ve died inside
No point trying to swim against the rising tide
The constant pressure, I’m under siege
Everyone waiting for me to under achieve
Believe everybody leaves as the days go on
To too many friends I’ve had to say so long
I feel defeated, beaten and filled with sin
Only person in the race and still won’t win
I feel ugly, bored, tired and sick
I want to stop breathing, I’m dying to quit.
