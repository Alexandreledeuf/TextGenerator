ocean's pounding surf
reoccuring memories
trying to forget
a sea gull's keen eyes
ocean's stroking ablutions
my daily failings
a forest beckons
across this untainted field
fresh snow innocence
footprints in the snow
wherever your beauty hides
I'll willingly go
waking to your beauty
finding your quiet waters
ecstasy of love
