A sailor return to an ocean
And always live in our memories
It was a true pleasure
To have known you
Words cannot adequately express
Your dedication and devotion to us
Your kind hearted
Generous spirit
Vibrant sense of humour
Will live forever
Your time will have a lasting impression
Deep witihin all the now broken heart
Of those you touched
You will never escape our heart
It is hard to believe
You are no longer with us
You endured so much for so long
And hugged many hearts
You were such an inspiration
And a gift in our life
We will absolutely miss you
You will rise up like an eagle
Soaring by the power of love
No more suffering and pain
You are now sleeping peacefully
In the arms of smiling angels
You are singing in heaven
May perpetual light shine upon you
