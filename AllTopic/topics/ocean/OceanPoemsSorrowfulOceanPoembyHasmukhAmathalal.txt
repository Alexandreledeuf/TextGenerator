Life is like vast ocean,
Full of sorrow and pain,
Joy less and worry main,
Not to loose hope and energy regain,
To Learn a lesson from each failure,
Content with less and nothing to procure,
Difficulties more but patience to endure,
No immediate result but success is sure,
If life was ever to be smooth,
Who would pray and take oath?
Eat more and carry the weight
Sound sleep and get up late
Life and death are two parts of wheel
failure of any one may makes us to feel
Life may move on and doesnâ€™t come to an end
Pray for success and ways to mend
who understands life but never lament?
No regrets but passing the comment
trying very hard to overcome the shock
Time never stops as clicks the time in clock
Hardship may give you endurance and strength
Will power to withstand and go to any length
No loss of face but to feel at ease,
Success to knock and failure to cease
