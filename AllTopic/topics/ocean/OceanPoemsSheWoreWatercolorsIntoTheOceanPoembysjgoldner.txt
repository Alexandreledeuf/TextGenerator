Enticing the freedom of the creviced earth
a young woman was fleeing the very
confines of her creature,
when she fell into the orphic mist of a fjord
that led to a blue, blue, ocean.
The seaweed agar, once dried in the sun,
provided her vitamins while the lox
from a tiny spring fed her minerals.
And within the narrow inlet of rock
she kept company with dozens of protected moas
whose feathers mimicked the nacreous of the beautiful shells.
Pierced by sadness and paralyzed in sudden oblivion,
she began to sharpen her wits & sort out contradiction.
Quoining a bed with a type of tinder wedge,
she embarked on the belief: there was life after death.
