Your voice is like gentle whispers of the wind
Gently blowing in my ears.
The sun of your smile kisses my skin
And melts all within me.
The waves wrapping around me with warm arms
Gently smoothing the rough edges.
With fingers that caress my body
And feel the inner soul.
My open mind of ocean waves
Opens my heart to see inside.
The gentleness of heart and mind
Washing away all troubled thoughts.
