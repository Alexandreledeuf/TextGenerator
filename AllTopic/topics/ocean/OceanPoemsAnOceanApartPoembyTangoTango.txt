Even though we live,
an ocean apart,
somehow gradually,
you have crept into my heart.
Talking to each other nearly every day,
discussing any subject come what may.
To each other,
our innermost secrets we confide,
honest and open, nothing to hide.
Who knows, to where our friendship will lead,
like a flower perhaps It will blossom, and bloom,
from just one little seed.
Tango.
