The bubbles of the ocean are
very special to me
because the feeling of
the bubbles between your
toes when you walk by the
the waves as they are crashing onto the shore
reminds me of you and me together on the beach.
when you and I walk so slowly back to my beach house
and at the same time we are holding hands
titly as we walk on the shore
by the crashing bubbly waves.
No wonder I love the bubbly feeling between my toes.
They remind me of the special times we had with each other
on the beach together.
