At Sunset,
I Watch
The Great Green Serpent
Of The Sea,
Turning Her Sinuous Body
Beneath The Surface Swells.
Swirling, Writhing In
Sheer Ecstasy,
Flinging Huge Golden Reflections
Of Her Gilded Scales
Onto The Heaving Waves
As They Toss Themselves Joyfully
Onto The Shore.
And As She Twists
Her Metallic Curves,
The Deep Sonorous Roar
Of Her Laughter Is Felt
As Well As Heard,
And The Magical Exchange
Of Sunlight
Between Her
And The Fiery Solar Orb
Is So Magnetic,
So Brilliant,
That We Tiny Lifeforms
May Only Marvel
At The Vastness
Of Mysterious Forces
Which Spin Marvelous Spells And Currents
Around Us All.
