Inky gear with million accessories
The - Wisps of clouds
Charismatic Moon
And Celestial bodies.
You dazzle like a jewel
In the shinning carroty sun,
You’re calm and poised
When ornamented by the twinkling stars.
‘You’re the Sky’.
Crystalline drops wetted with effervescence
The - Ebbing and soaring waves
Turbulence and tranquility
Azure brilliance.
I catch the morning light
And sketch the rising sun on me.
I shine, I glow and I feel beautiful
When complimented by the sky.
‘I’m The Ocean’.
I love it when you are in a mischievous mood
It’s when you stir up a breeze - And play with me.
I treasure and hold every pearly tear that you shed
Happy or otherwise - And I consume it.
I love it when you elevate the temperature
It’s then that you evaporate me - And fly me to your abode.
We’re so much like the ‘Ocean and the Sky’ -
Eager to meet,
Complimenting each other,
Sharing Secrets,
Seeming to kiss and embrace.
We’re so much like the ‘Ocean and the Sky’ -
Summiting at the horizon -
Which is a mere apparition.
We touch,
But the touch dosen't reach
Beyond our borders.
