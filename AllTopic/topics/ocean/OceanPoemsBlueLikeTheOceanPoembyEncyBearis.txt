How vast is the ocean?
I know it is in wide scope
How dangerous this ocean?
A lot and too much chances
To explore, you can be drowned
With the waves you can be nowhere
How deep it could be?
Like the love of yours
How vast, how deep
How blue, how loyal
Deeper, bluer than blue
So I dunk my desolate life into that ocean
Immerse it into utmost contentment
Just to feel that lost pleasing touch
To get the fullness of the bright life
I found it, its deeper in you
Bluer than blue ocean
I enjoy the scenery of bright life
