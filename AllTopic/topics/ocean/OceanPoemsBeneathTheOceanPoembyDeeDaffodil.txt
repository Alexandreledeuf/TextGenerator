What lies beneath the ocean blue,
In depths of mariner's legends?
Where creatures hide in crevices,
And divers get the Bends.
Beneath those stormy seas my friend,
Who knows what you will find?
Some say there may be fish fossils,
Or creepy creatures of a kind.
Yes, down below the murky seas,
Where little plant life grows,
Untouched by rays of warm sunlight,
Where, what lives there, God only knows!
I often wonder what there is,
Beneath the water dark and cold.
Someday, someone will search those depths,
But I am not that bold! !
-A poem by Dee Daffodil  (H.W 1982)
