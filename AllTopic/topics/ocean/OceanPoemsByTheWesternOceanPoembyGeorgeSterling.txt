Craig! Craig! my Love irradiant and divine!
Here on the solitary sands I lie
And see afar the lingering sunset die,
As peacefully its fading splendors shine
On western wave and on the eastern pine;
And oh! to watch with thee that flaming sky,
My heart one joy, one sacrament, one cryâ€”
The heart whose very silences are thine!
The glory passes . . . Lo! the moon is up.
Remote and pure, that silvern, ancient cup
From which earth drinks enchantment. Love! to be
Its insubstantial pearl upon thy face!
Ah! dearest! for an hour of thine embrace,
Hushed by the deathless music of the sea!
