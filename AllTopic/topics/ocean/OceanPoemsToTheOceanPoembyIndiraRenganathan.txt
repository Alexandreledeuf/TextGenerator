It's thou dawning horizon
That dots the first sindhur
Lambent on earth's crinion
Bubbling with waving freshener
It's thee in morn tide light
Bumpy-bumpy-busy wavering-
Over a pretext for a breakfast
As if it is earth-heaven's wedding
It's thee on slumbering nap
With bellyful salty food and aqua
Under sunny shade in a wavy trap
As if feasted in meridian awe
Plentiful thee, in plentiful harmony
For plentiful people along the border
Thou rollers in tender melody-
Seems a warm evening wedding- splendour
And thee! why so awful
In sunless hours in spumy fear?
Sembling a human life frightful
