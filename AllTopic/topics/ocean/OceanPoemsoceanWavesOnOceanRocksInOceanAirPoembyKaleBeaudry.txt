Wind Whisked West;
An Undeniable Stretch
Of Realistic Form.
Lightning Strikes Twice,
Revealing The Different
Are The Norm.
Take Cover From the
Storm, One Look At
First Glance Changes
Words to Swords.
It's a Seperate Way Of
Existance,
A Smile Beyond A Smile
Invites Even The
Simplest
Mind Open At Dark
