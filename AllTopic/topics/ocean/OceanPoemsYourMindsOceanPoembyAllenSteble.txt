Swimming away
swimming away
swimming away yeah
swimming through the deep blue ocean
nothing but red skies ahead
so put on ya hat and sun screen lotion
Feel the wind and waves in motion
Let's go swimming in your mind's ocean
The waters so calm
And the breeze so sweet
No cause for alarm
From my head to my feet
My mind was a cell
Trapped by illusion
Until the rough swell
Destroyed my delusions
Swimming away
swimming away
Swimming away
In your mind's ocean
wake up in the water
before you sink below
For the deeper you go
The darker it grows
so put on ya hat and sun screen lotion
Feel the wind and waves in motion
Let's go swimming in your mind's ocean
Thoughts of doom and no hope
I'll drop them in the ocean's deep
To save my mind when I grope
I'm Dead to the world in this cool sleep
Not a soul in sight
Not a worry in the world
Just the open sea
Where I can simply be
Swimming away
Swimming away
we'll swim all night
And sleep all day
so put on ya hat and sun screen lotion
Feel the wind and waves in motion
Lets go swimming
Lets go Swimming
in your mind's ocean
