Beaming a Beatle tune, Across the Universe, is a fanciful idea,
It will take 431 years, at the speed of light, to reach the star of the north,
Permission was given by all those involved to NASA,
It will be beamed like satellite television is to today,
Across the Universe will have to be decoded,
I wonder aliens have a company called DISH or DIRECT by the way,
The questions are:
1)    If you are coordinating the target against you what see it's not there,
Since the light that you see left the star back in1577,
Who knows it will be now or in 2438 for that matter.
2)  	Polaris could exploding right now and we would not know it till 2438,
For us now living we would be dead or would we?
(see observation The Top)   We can see it from Heaven.
Carl Sagan wanted to put a CD containing Here Comes the Sun on Voyager,
He was refused permission,
Because the owners of the song,
Thought it would copyright infringement.
The CD gold plated was to show pictures on earth, sounds on earth,
Classical music, various languages,
A repertoire of ethnomusicologistical instrumentation,
Pictures of us earthlings from birth.
The thought of an alien life force taking the song Here Comes the Sun for their own,
Was completely unbearable for APPLE, the publishing company,
Were the aliens a member of ASCAP or BMI?
But hopefully the intelligent life out there would get something good,
Besides all the news about Britney Spears.
(see observation The Ode to TMZ)
If there is life on the planets surrounding Polaris, they may RSVP,
We should get their response back 2880, in about 862 years.
