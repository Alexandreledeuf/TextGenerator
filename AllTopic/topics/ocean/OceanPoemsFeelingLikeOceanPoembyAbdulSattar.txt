Put your hand in ocean
And pour all the water in thy palm
Then can you find my love’s limit
Can you find the spark of emotion?
That heats up the soul so calm
What feeling you have I don’t know
But the waves I feel so strong
I can feel them for long
And the first golden ray onto the surface
That gold of my love I present to thee
The waves can send it to you
With my message of hard struggle
O, it is hard to reach the side
And feel the smile of morning
Put both the hands in the waters
And raise them to the sky
You will hide the stars
Find my love in the ocean
And you will feel no limits
Of unbreakable relationship
As of the water and water
As of the horizon and horizon
Waves will pass, waves will come
And our love cannot be exhausted
