As I drift through space alone,
I hear a man yell over the radio,
“It'll be ok! ”
I click the radio off,
Because I know better.
I sigh contently and twist my body slightly
To try and capture this panorama of beauty
In my last minutes.
This is what I have been waiting
My whole life for.
The luminescent sun flares brilliantly,
And the lambent stars glow
Three times as effulgent
Than they ever will
On the clearest, most perfect night.
I start to form constellations in my head.
I even create one of you.
I hear a beep,
And a woman’s robotic
Voice say “low oxygen.”
I don’t care.  My only regret
Is that you aren't here
With me.  My tears start
To stream down my face
As I remember you.
I am so alone.
But now, in this ocean of stars,
I will be with you forever.
