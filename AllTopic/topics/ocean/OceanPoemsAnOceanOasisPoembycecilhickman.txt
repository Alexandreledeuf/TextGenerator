A vista touched by the hand of nature unsurpassed on Earth.
Now my imagination with my words take you to see itâ€˜s worth.
Out into the horizon your eyes will see glorious Waves peaks.
Contained amazement will capture the seashores exquisiteness.
Emerging from the Heavens, the clouds ponder in streaks.
Ages seem to pass but only seconds breach the attractiveness.
Now your mind totally releasing you, unwanted neurotic past.
On the beach the sand so crystalline like, warm to the touch.
As you walk slowly noticing the breeze, anticipating shadows cast.
Stretching palms climb skyward, reaching for the sun so much.
Intellect has no reference during this special time or at this space.
Senses surrounded by glorious beauty feeling peace in this place.
