When the sun sets over the ocean
when the moon begins to rest
she sits at the ocean’s beach
its red cloak disappears in the west.
Each evening she yearns for its beauty
the feeling cannot be surpassed
she wishes its elegance would prevail
but like a ship it lowers its mast.
Soon she’ll be as one with the sunset
the sickness has taken its toll
the thought of resting in its magnificence
lulls her heart and soul
