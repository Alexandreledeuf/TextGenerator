You make me want to sail in the ocean of your eyes.
The winds will carry me, I know not where,
To harbors unknown, and I fully realize
That dangerous storms could be lurking there.
Will the deep blue waters stay pure and serene
On our path to paradise, earthly or above,
Where our joys and passions and moments supreme
Come steadily together to maintain our love.
Will our life's sustaned and rapturous note
Ever remind us to those very fateful skies,
On the day that launched my fragile boat
In that everlasting twinkle, the ocean of your eyes?
