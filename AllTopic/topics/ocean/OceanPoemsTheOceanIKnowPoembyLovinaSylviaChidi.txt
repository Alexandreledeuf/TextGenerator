I know it to be true
That the ocean sea is blue
I know it to be true
The mountains compliment the ocean
The fountains supplement the ocean
I know it to be true
The ocean is extremely salty
Inhabited by fishes of various faculties
I know it to be true
The ocean is a source of food and minerals
Embellished with floors of pearls, shells and corals
I know it to be true;
That infinite battles have been fought
Across stormy tidal and calmly ocean waves
Where slaves have been sold and bought
With freedom won not merely by a simple handshake
I know it to be true;
That down below is an amazing picture
Of many a wonderful sea creature
That fishermen, endlessly try to capture
What about the water sports being featured?
Swimming, diving, boating, and waterskiing
All written excitingly in the oceans scripture
Still the ocean sometimes doesnâ€™t know how to behave
When they come marching, those ginormous tidal waves!
All those present become a slave to its oceanic graves
And yet I know it to be true
If we shave all the water of the oceans carpet
Living will not be worth it on this planet!
