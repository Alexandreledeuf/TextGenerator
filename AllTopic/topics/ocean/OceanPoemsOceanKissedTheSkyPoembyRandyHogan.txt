Like the Ocean kissed The Sky
At the most beautiful place under the sun,
For true love is so hard to find
but we just keep searching
for our soul can be complete
It's in that lovely special place
of bluest of blues which are both under
the sun that gives you so much beauty
It's where the ocean and sky
never ends kissed by the sun over and
over a again.
Our hearts come together to
kiss like the ocean kissed the sky
for our hearts are like two large waves
falling on one another over and over
again.
As i swim and you fly
we will meet at
where the ocean kissed the sky
