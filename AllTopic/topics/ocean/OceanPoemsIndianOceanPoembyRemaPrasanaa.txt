You  Time
don't try to hibernate
near my sand shores,
the souls you have pierced
through the needles
write in ink that is black
an epitaph for your memory
a sincere condolence note,
You Time
don't sing that song again
hide not the shadows
behind your wheels.
You standstill time
In wheels from noon to night
you run to reach the same
single point
in that rhythmless tune
don't hang above
my shores like a conqueror
I am ocean
Indian Ocean
