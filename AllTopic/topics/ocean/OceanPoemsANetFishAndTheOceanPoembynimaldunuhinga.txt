I am a net and I have to obey what Master says.
I also like to get a rest as the others
But he throws me into the water day & night for a big catch.
What can I do my little fish?
We are eternal foes in this dirty game
----
I am a fish and my Master never allow me to live ashore.
But my question is why people come to sea and catch us?
----
I am the ocean and I watch the sky forever.
Horizon is an illusion and we never met.
