Ocean Of Man's Heart
The ocean of man's heart is deep
every now and then it will leak.
The ocean of man's heart is cold
sometimes reaching into his soul.
The ocean of man's heart is sure
sometimes polluted but spirit remains pure.
The ocean of man's heart is clear
playing silently to his inner ear.
The ocean of man's heart is deep
watch out for loves little leaks.
