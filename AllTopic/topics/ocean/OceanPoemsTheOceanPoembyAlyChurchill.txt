Hearing the sound of the ocean roar
The sun shinning on the sea shimmering
Watching the segul's soar
And the sand glimmering
Seeing the crabs scurrying across the sand
Watching the dolphins jump through waves
Holding sea shells in your hands,
And watching the sun set at the end of day.
Everthing is lite up by the moon light
Which makes the ocean beautiful
Gazing into the starry night
And seeing the moon so full
Now the sea creatures are at rest
The ocean is one of natures best!
