Liquid dusk looking back through me
reflecting back the starlight that catches itself
tangling in droplets of water that freckle your skin
lifting them with my tongue
I taste hope and salt and the glistening sweet smell of you.
When rest my cheek against the bleach-sun shell of your chest
I hear a fluttering sigh and the sound of your breath
is the ocean.
