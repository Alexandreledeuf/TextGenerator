Ocean of poems
I walk along your shore
with a paintbrush and canvas
to recreate a portrait
and not listen your mindless waves
that I know only can tame me
not subjugate me any further
open up your treasures for me
you know sure that I am
genuine in my mind and
I need to paint now your
crimson burnt fusion of
my Sun near your fenced
horizon
let the waves mock for sure
they blemished their rhythm on
all the rocks so strong and
forgot to smile
Ocean, I am as fearless now
the way you are...
