The daylight is young from the ocean deep
Where earth things come alive in the sunrise,
When the blue from yonder opens and sigh
Awakes to life from a wait and asleep;
The hours from dark from the colors instep
Closer earth songs will be heard in the skies,
When the pretty lives young open its eyes
Music from the wild once again will sweep.
To ears with beauty like never before
The moments so friendly and far underneath,
Lifted and shattered by the breathing gust;
That brought the ocean tide onto the shore,
That comes from the deep dark in the ET
When the waves comes inert in the high boost.
