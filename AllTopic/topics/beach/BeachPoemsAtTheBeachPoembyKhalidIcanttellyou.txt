At The Beach
You roll down the window
And even before you see it
You smell that salty, ocean scent
You already know your there
At the beach
Where the breeze is best
Where the sun is most powerful
Mother Natureâ€™s birthplace
At the beach
There so much to do
Starting from building sand castles
To finding shells so odd looking
To riding tsunami on your surfboard
To tanning yourself like bread in the toaster
To fishing with your grandpa
To snorkeling with fish
To going on cruises
To riding a dolphin
Just so much to do
The list is as big as space
As long as infinity
At the beach
As you walk on the shore
You see the sky red as the sun sits on the water
You feel the sand filling the gaps between your toes
You hear the soothing sounds of the waves
At the beach
Some claim to see the most wondrous things
Like beautiful mermaids sitting on rocks
Or the mysterious Loch Ness Monster
And even the lost city of Atlantis
At the beach
There nothing better than the beach
Where beauty was given its name
Where Happiness cannot be expressed
At the beach
