There are things in life that everybody wants….
She believes that in order to find the perfect shell
one has to comb a lot of beaches; walking for miles
barefoot in the foamy wash, with the sun by your side

in those moments, when the sun and sky close their eyes.
that the moon will ebb the tide and the water will depart
from the sandy shore leaving behind for our discovery
that perfect shell. The one everybody wants…..
