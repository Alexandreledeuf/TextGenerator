just hold my hand, love
lead me to heaven
under the stars
by the side of the sea,
just sit by my side, love
and let our eyes say our thoughts
fingers in the sand
spell out your love for me
listen to the waves, love
as they strike against the rocks
they drum out a message
of your love just for me
just hold my hand tightly love
lead me to the cove
our special secret place
for all eternity
just hold me in your arms, love
let my ears hear your heart
it beats strong and loud
it beats for only me
just gaze at the stars, love
as they twinkle in the twilight
they fllash a special morse code
that sings your love for me
as the shadows lengthen, love
and the sun enters the sea
your fingers in my hair
love me warm and tenderly
the moon has risen high, love
your beloved face so silvery
joy shines out from within your eyes
as my lashes close langourously
just you and me love
no one else, only the warm blue sea
golden sands, swaying palms
only you and only me
just hold my hand, love
lead me to heaven
under the stars
by the side of the sea,
just sit by my side, love
and let our eyes say our thoughts
fingers in the sand
spell out your love for me
listen to the waves, love
as they strike against the rocks
they drum out a message
of your love just for me
just hold my hand tightly love
lead me to the cove
our special secret place
for all eternity
just hold me in your arms, love
