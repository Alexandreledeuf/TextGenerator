Golden Moon has appeared high above the night Sea;
Heavy wind is blowing fast after a long spell of heat;
Sea looks beautiful enticing new comers to swim soon!
But the 2004 Tsunami has changed the nature of Sea
From harmless beach into dangerous beach of beauty!
Swayed by beauty swimmers have drowned to death
By sudden high tides that develop now and then there!
River tributaries joining the Sea mouth has created island
Where many go for boating seeing the beauty wonderful
And also swim long swayed by the enjoyment soothing;
Then the tragedy occurs by sudden current in the Sea!
Warning boards are displayed here and there for all to see;
But who cares at them while enjoying comforts and beauty!
Alertness when let loose men of ease canâ€™t escape tight noose!
