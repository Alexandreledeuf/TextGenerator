There the kites come
Head grasped in the children’s hands
Looking for wind
While their tails get tickled by sand
Ah, there comes the wind
And the kites soar into the sky
The children let out more rope
To see the kites go high high high
They flew hither and thither
Twisting their long necks
The passing by birds
Gave them loving pecks
They swished their magnificent tails
Hugging each other again and again
They danced to the beat of the wind
Even when started had the rain
Later they  stopped playing
The sea was crashing, forming foam
As a child said to the others
“We’ve played enough, lets go home”.
