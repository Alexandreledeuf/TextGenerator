One summer's day, with nothing better to do,
I went to the beach to enjoy the view.
Lots of cute babes lying around in the sand
Trying their best to improve their tan.
Others strutting around, showing off their stuff
With swimwear so small, almost in the buff.
One gal, probably from Bimini
Wore a very teeny, weeny Bikini,
Very daring, three slices of zucchini.
Her costume was so very spare
Almost like it wasn't there.
Another beauty, this one from New York
Wore only two Band-Aids and a cork.
Very innovative, I'll have to say
Anyway, it really made my day.
Even if you're almost over the hill
Your inner passions are with you still.
I find great pleasure just being a fan
Even if they call me a dirty old man.
I really did enjoy my day
And for tomorrowâ€”?
It's the topless beach down the way!
