Let’s talk while we walk on the sandy beach
The moon kissed sand cold under our feet
Makes our feeling’s warm, desires hot
Twosome we make a nice pair
Let me hold your hands and kiss you
My dear on your lascivious lips
Let’s  club our feelings and make it one
We have lot to know and lot to do
My dear come close to me be by my side
The surf is sweeping  under our feet
Let me lift you and smooch you
To my hearts content
Lets enjoy this evening
And make a day to remember
In the days and years to come
