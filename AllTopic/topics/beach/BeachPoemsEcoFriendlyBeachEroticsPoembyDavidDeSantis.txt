Little surfer chic
Cleaning out my clock.
Including a schematic,
Of your sensory socks.
Please care to move your foot
While
Rubbing round my leg,
Like a little surfer chic
Stroking it again.
Your sitting on a wave
Or riding my surf board
And I’m a shark in your ocean
While you swim from the shore.
Little hippy chic
I’ll rest my jaws on you
A playful bite
Of  a white
Whose ballast
Floats here too.
So little surfer girl
take a trip to your beach
And I’ll dig your hole
With my shovel
Until the ocean I’ve reached.
