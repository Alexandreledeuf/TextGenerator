The two of us alone on that stony Cheathrú Rua beach
On a July evening that almost seemed like my reason for being.
It was our last day together and the sun was burning strong.
The coral tucked snugly in under tranquil lapping waves
Like a well fitted carpet – well, at least in appearance –
For its prickle could ignite fires on tender bare feet.
But this day grit between my toes was of little pertinence
As we talked of life and our paths here, sharing tales,
Sharing moments that made us laugh until we cried.
And then you paused, a serious stare. An instant frozen forever:
Your golden hair blew gently in the passing sea breeze,
You looked at me intensely and said simply, “I’ll miss you.”
I could not speak, my throat was blocked.
I spoke only with my eyes when ours locked.
Our faces were ones that only a coral Connemara beach could remember.
The sea it glistened.
