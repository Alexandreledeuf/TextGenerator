I am walking along a street, on soft asphalt,  and
I am sticking heels  into the zebra.
of the marquise on the other side firmly heated up.
the crescent shaped  bun stuffed with the chocolate
is swimming in the shop, from the warmth,
one moment, and I will  wet my legs  at the edge,
and then, I will catch myself crests of wave
swimming of up on down, and  I will  feel  blissful chill.
now, one bend and...welcomes me auriferous familiar
sand.your glasses, are covering with half a face.
but I can see the smile, from a distance,  it is not...
a duplicate...
