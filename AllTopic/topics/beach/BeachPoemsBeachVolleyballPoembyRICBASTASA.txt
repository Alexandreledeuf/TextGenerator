beach volleyball today.
you wear your cap
to protect you from the sun.
you wear your beach shorts
blue shorts with big white flowers
prints.
you walk barefoot.
and then you decide to walk straight
to the internet cafe.
and you are here now.
you do not like
anybody else.
cruel world. hot sun. your flight
is still tomorrow morning.
another loud night.
an impatient self trying to be
completely silent.
shut.
