Birds swimming in the sky
Colours blended with the kite
Beach's gleaming in sandy white
Sun shining a beauty in my eye.
Boats sliding pass sunbather's row
As they gaze up the sky so blue
Images painted on clouds so white
A background to my imaginary flight.
I was there and where were you
Nowhere to perceive but just a shadow,
In the shades of trees and sandy beaches
An image reflected on water's surface,
A mirage of you lost in the shady trees
Lost in the sky's white coloured shades.
In nature and in man's work of wonder
We get lost to find and discover
The truth an image in our mind reveals
As we fly up high and come down our heels.
Out here we lay by the sun's rays,
Counting footsteps on the sandy beaches.
