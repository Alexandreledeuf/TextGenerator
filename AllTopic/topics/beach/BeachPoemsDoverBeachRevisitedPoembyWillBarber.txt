Come praise unnecessary wars, although
Videos and narratives must disprove
Theses of  conspiracy theorists, who
Govern us from their pretended love
Of Freedom, and Democracy.  Rhetoric
Trumps reality, no facts must interfere
With their Dominion.   Never dare connect
Belief with fact, lest then there should appear
Black helicopters, agents unidentified
Who confiscate your dreams, and then deride
Plain evidence.  Time is not on your side,
You poets!   Write of waves and tides
That echo on some distant, white-cliffed shore -
Rattling pebbles,  gestures, winds -  no more.
