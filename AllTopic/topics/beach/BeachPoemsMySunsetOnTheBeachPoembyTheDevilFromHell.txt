Early one evening
I caught the lore
Of the fresh air
From the calm sea shore
I crept out of bed
Then out of the house
I made not a sound
Just like a mouse
I walked down the path
On to the sand
Loving the sea
And the layer of the land
I walked to the water
My feet felt it splash
I listen to the birds
And the waves crash
I looked in the distance
The suns going down
I backed from the water
And sat on the ground
The skies changing colors
From purple violet to red
I sat back resting
Relaxing my head
The sky continued to change
Every color shades
Every color bright and vivid
Not a one cascades
Orange yellow white
To gray
Theses beautiful colors
End another day
I watch the night
Slowly enter
Feeling as though
I’m in the center
I feel relaxed
Fully at peace
Watching the night
Fully increase
The colors are gone
The night is now black
I can’t wait till tomorrow
When the colors come back
I lay there awhile
Then get up and start walking
Stars shining bright
The crickets now talking
Of the sun setting colors I think
As I lay back in my bed
Their beauty their shade and their life
All relaxing inside of my head
