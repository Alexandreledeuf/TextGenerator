Walking Along The Beach In Nova Scotia
Walking barefoot  in the sand
on a quiet Sunday morning
at peace with natures surroundings.
A warm sunny day with
a faint scent of fish filtering through the air.
The ocean breeze caressing my body,
giving me a tranquil feeling,
in this awesome atmosphere.
At peace with nature,
enjoying every moment,
I heard the cry of the loon.
I saw him standing at the waters edge
as if to say, good morning.
He spread his wings to a full span,
held it there awhile.
I watched with anticipation
wondering what was yet to come
from this magnificent creature
of the wild.
He stood like a king looking at me,
took flight and soared through the sky.
The sand dollars were plentiful,
displaying their artistic designs.
I continued to walk as
the sand massaged my feet.
It was a joyous morning
walking along the
beach.
