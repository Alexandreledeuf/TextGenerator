Please don't tie me up in a relation,
please don't ask me silly questions,
please don't take away me freedom,
please don't sweet talk,
i know without you I'd have to walk.
Please don't buy me flowers,
please don't light up like a tower,
please don't make promises,
please don't make my heart who misses,
fake hugs and fake kisses,
please get out of my life when it's all over,
please don't look for me like a rover,
please don't let me be your lover,
please don't get emotional,
i won't cry coz i am rational,
please don't look like i betrayed you,
who said i ever loved you? ,
please don't try to negotiate,
please stop pretending and don't agitate,
please don't take my heart away,
please let the sand slip away,
please don't behave like a leech,
am only asking for *** on the beach.
