G-ood morning sunshine
L-ets the dawn break with glee;
A-iming to make a beautiful
D-ay of mirth and ecstasy.
Y-ear added to the lady is something to remember;
S-adness should step back to make her feel glad and better.
M-oonlight shadows have faded,
A-fter the night walks away;
E-very twenty-second January, she celebrates her birthday.
