The garnet is a complicated and lesser known gemstone. There is a Family of Garnets (seven major classifications)   and they are all very hard glassy silicates. They contain a variety of metals and have a wide colour range from black to colourless. Some rare forms of Garnet are more valuable than diamonds.

To protect them through the night.
