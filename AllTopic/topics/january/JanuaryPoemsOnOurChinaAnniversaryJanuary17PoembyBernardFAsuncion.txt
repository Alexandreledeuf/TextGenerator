On our China anniversary
Love goes on under the sun;
From Paper to Crystal that has ended
Another new one has just begun.
Twenty years of living together
Is not a walk in the park;
At times the days are sunny,
Sometimes the clouds are dark.
But by God's loving hand
We've ventured into the rough sea;
Able to climb the highest hill,
Striving hard toward victory.
We've stood against all odds,
Braving the wind of changes;
We've remained firm and steadfast,
Making all the right choices.
As long as we have each other,
We do hope for the Silver's dawn;
Praying not only for the Gold
But also for the dazzling Diamond.
The pages of the next chapter
Are willed by the Father's hand;
A new episode shall be written
Till we reach the promised land.
Our love for one another
Shall achieve the higher degree;
It will grow all the more
On our China anniversary.
