it's one of those rare winter nights
when it's not freezing cold
but crazy windy weather
rain poured down the whole day long
lightning flashed in the sky
and there is a sense of danger
yes this weather really scares me
I feel my heart beat faster
and I long for peace and calm
yet it is winter, it's to be expected
the temperature is dropping like crazy
and I know winter is purple pink and violet
