The angels promised to stay on guard.
And that they did.
Mom realized that I was her little miracle.
When I look back I realize she made a conscious
Decision to love, protect, and direct.
And that she did.
All through life she has been my greatest fan.
She's been my advisor.
She's been my close friend.
If I had a chance to choose a mother
I would choose her again and again.
There's so much I plan to do for her
as a token of my love and appreciation.
The little things I've done for her sometimes
cause her to say.. 'Thank God He kept you safe
within my womb.' I'm thankful too.
I'm thankful she's my mom.
One day in January I was born
held and nourished by a lovely soul.
I am because she is.
