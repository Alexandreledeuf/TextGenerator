An icy wind whistles past,
Another reminder that it’s January,
A cold, wintry month,
With merciless rain,
That batters down on our heads,
As if trying to crush us.
But you were my summer,
Shining like the sun all year round,
A warm glow to cuddle up to,
A loving friend who stuck by me,
Through the good and the bad.
From when I was very small,
I always told you everything,
From the places I’d been,
To the things I’d achieved,
You were always delighted to hear about it,
But things have changed.
January is cold now,
And each day even colder,
Now that you’re gone,
There’s a hole,
A space where you should be,
Like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle,
But you’re missing.
When I think of you,
It makes me cry,
But it becomes summer again,
Because I can still tell you things,
And I know you’ll listen.
The hole is not completely empty,
Because you’re still there,
You’re still with me,
And I’ll never forget you,
How could I?
I love you to pieces,
And I always will.
It’s summer wherever you are,
And the people there will be glad to see you,
For you will be their summer too,
Just like you were mine.
(For my Nanna who passed away on 31st January 2007)
