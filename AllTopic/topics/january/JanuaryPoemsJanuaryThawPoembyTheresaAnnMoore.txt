Green grass shows its face once again
Warmth and rain are melting the snow
Small rivers form, rushing to the drain
The trend will be brief, no need to mow
The fog gives witness to the gentle thaw
Careful on left over bits of ice, avoid a fall…
You may discover the force of Newton’s Law
After the introduction you may have no recall
It is a great day to stay inside and observe
The changing landscape where it is dry
The climbing temperatures will soon swerve
With a downward dive, the snow will again fly
This is Michigan, you know we have a motto
If you are tired of the weather, wait a minute
As the eye blinks, Mother Nature will bestow
A change of mind on a roller coaster transit
