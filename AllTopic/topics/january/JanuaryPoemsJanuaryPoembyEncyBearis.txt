And the world is passing away
along with its desire, but whoever
does, the God abides forever ****
************ (1 John 2: 17)
So does the human life will pass away eventually
To live for certain years if possible, undeniably
such a desire by anyone and appeal to the Lord
because we have still purpose to be in this world
And the life goes with the time as the world turns
time to time, days, months, years, to that pattern
The year start with the month of January
Month goes by until December annually
But I figure out, January means a lot to me
It is in January that I wish, pray, prompt me
to thank my parent, specially my mother, whom
she let me see the first light from her dark womb
Thank thee to God to the life given until now
and let me see this fantastic world somehow
I wish that I have to live 'til time of senescence
Grant it, so I can still enjoy the universe essence
To be in good health physically and mentally
Continuously be with my friends and family
To let me live every 23rd of January, and thereafter
My desire, and thanks as the world goes to its own venture
