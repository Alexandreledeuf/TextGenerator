Walking in the light
The sun shines bright
Knowing in my heart that this is right
I still keep walking, walking, walking
Walking away from you
Walking away from me
Running away from us
Mixed emotions in my head
Wanna turn back but I still keep walking
Head up in the sky
No questions
No asking why
I'm flying high
I'm leaving with no good byes
Smiling, I made the right choice
But I still hear your voice running in my head
I am not taking back what I said
I have to keep walking, running, escaping...from you
You lied
I cried
I was hurting dead inside
Trying so hard to show my pride
It's hard with tears in your eyes
'Be strong' they say
'Don't be weak'
People cry not because they are weak
It's because they have been strong for too long
A new me starting over
I've landed on my 4-leaf clover
Best of luck you'll always be in my heart
But right now I need a new start to finish my end
Laugh more
Smile more
Saying Amen!
You were a great friend
Now it's time for my heart to mend...
