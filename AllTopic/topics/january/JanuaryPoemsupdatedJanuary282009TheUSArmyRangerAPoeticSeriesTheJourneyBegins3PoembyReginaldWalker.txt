Mission Three: An enemy to erase
Mission Three: An enemy to erase
Early this morning, I awoke from the comforts of my bed.
I immediately gathered the gear I will need for today.
By tomorrow night, another marked enemy will be dead.
At least that is what the words on my covert assignment say.
Slowly across the dense jungle floor, the U. S. Army Ranger silently slide.
I am hunting for the enemy, the marked one, I have been ordered to slay.
In the dense bushes and under the shadows of the trees, I secretly hide.
I am always very careful to cover my tracks along the way.
Quietly moving, I quickly travel unseen across the jungle floor,
I make my way by night; I must be gone by the break of day.
Finally, I am now very close to my enemyâ€™s front door.
Without delay, I am prepared to make this enemy into my prey.
Unseen, I set up my gear in the brush by the unguarded back gate.
I covered myself and concealed my gear under tree limbs and grass.
Carefully, focusing the scope on another enemy I have been ordered to eliminate.
Gently pulling the trigger on the 30-06 sniper rifle, I silently kill his ass.
Now that my assignment has successfully been done,
Quickly, I must make another run for the home base.
The U. S Army Ranger readily waits on the next one.
I wait for the next enemy I am assigned to erase.
