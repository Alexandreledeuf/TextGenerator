Travelling by buses from 2018 to 2019,
From bus to bus memory jumps up and jumps,
Like messages of pop ups we feel,
A past journey we can never forget,
And a new journey we can never deny!
Having journey by bus we have welcomed,
We have now our baby New Year 2019,
A two days old baby has started crawling,
Like this bus crawls in road to start journey,
A fresh memory has crawled in lane of mind.
At this bus terminal of Srikakulam City,
We love to ride this bus in this New Year,
To travel across pretty State of Andhra Pradesh,
We have great hope to visit Rajahmundry City
This bus will take us there soon we feel,
Sacred Godavari River is waiting for us
On the Eastern Bank of this Holy River,
Our New Year Bus will stop for a while,
We shall have our Holy New Year Bath,
Wishing our baby New Year all the best,
We shall travel towards holy city Tirupati!
Travelling across Southeastern Coast,
We shall treasure great memories of time,
Bringing us from Ichchapuram Town,
The bus has traveled much distance,
Passing through amazing Amaravati,
The great capital city of this state,
This bus will take us to Nellore City
Then via Kurnol and Anantapuram
We shall travel to Chittoor by this bus.
