It is January 1997...
And so far...
It has been far from Heaven
The skies has been dark shades of blue and gray...
As I bend my knees to pray...
The weather has been cold and wet...
As I sat in my room and wept...
As I wish to witness to see a
Heaven sent angel...
I tried to remain stable...
I strolled through the peaceful cemetery...
Searching for sanctuary.
As I perched my depressed infested body...
Against an ice cold tombstone...
Covered with time and age...
I see my life on the darkest stage.
I only wish the unhappiness away...
I only long to write the next play...
Of life that will bring hope.
And colorful dreams in cinemascope...
