Swami Vivekananda
(On 12th January,2019)
From coldness of mind to warmth
Of Being,
From idleness to ever inspired joy,
From unconsciousness to consciousness,
From Stupor of mind to superconscious self,
From selfishness to selfless service,
Let us be led.
O supreme Mind, The Soul of our souls,
O our Beloved the great,
Swami Vivekananda, let us be awakened.
Let us be centered to look beyond the fetters.
The darkness is deep all around,
The coolness is too much to bear with,
Let your speech declare every heart,
The dove of peace dawn to suffering humanity.
O knowledge divine, the sky of consciousness let you be remembered as Glimpse Eternal.
Walking the way is tiresome without knowing your message of love,
Let you shine again in the morning of our Minds,
In the Night shine as pole star and in the dawn The morning Star,
Let our thoughts be raised to height to touch the Sky,
Let our sleep be broken eternally,
Our consciousness wide open.
Let death be dead to have life of sacrifice,
To live fully totally in the moment,
Let all the palls be shredded from our minds to have a fresh look of The Sunshine,
Let us be centered enough to walk on the way shown by you.
