Frangipani's January Magic
When winter woes witherto emptiness
Like you wither wintered
O' Frangipani, blissis out in happy tears
Like your buddy fragrance sprouts
Mid the rift of winter and spring
Ask me not of my happy tears
Stop me not from those droplets
Foreach of them mirrors magical
Ask me not what or who
I know that you know well
In glistening fragrance of wafted love
Who else? you alone caress
With velvetytouch this 'January'
Cajoling, consoling, airing sweetly
Warding off erstwhile reeking stench
