Our lucky cat
Tom is she that
Gets a great chance
At the night
In thirty first
Of January
In two thousand
And eighteen
To observe
Four things together;
Which may happen
After every
Hundred and
Fifty two years,
These things are:
The first one-
The blue moon,
The second one-
The super moon,
The third one-
The blood red moon
And the fourth one is
The lunar eclipse;
So, we greet her in
Anacreontic
Verse with lots of
Roses and flowers,
Cartoon bears poster
Love marked sticker
Sings and dances, too.
