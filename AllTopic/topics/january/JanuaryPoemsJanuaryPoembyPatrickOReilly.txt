The great North Wind rattles the trees
And shatters their twigs to splinters
The sparkling quilt of snow knee-deep
Paves the streets of winter
Hilly dams span the roads
With city traffic hindered
Trudging through the sterile cold
Of the dry, crackling winter
A birch tree bends upon a wheel
Is any body injured?
Soft as snow, as hard as steel
A picture, a killer, winter
The sun dies out by four o'clock
The night sky quickly enters
It creeps in with short, breathy steps
That  sombre, freezing winter
