O watch out for Labour's leadership election!
Here are some of the risible contenders
In this donkey derby: the charmless Keir Starmer;
The teary eyed Lisa Nandy; the narcissist Jess Phillips;
The sanctimonious 'Lady Nugee' and the
Duplicitous David Lammy. If you fancy
A bet on an outsider, there's always the cold,
Calculated Yvette Cooper: yet another
Loyal Blairite. There's sure to be a swing to the right
Whoever wins. I couldn't care less as I'm now
Completely finished with the ridiculous, pointless
And pompous political class: that stabbed that true
Socialist Jeremy Corbyn in the back; and
So I won't be voting Labour ever again!
