Well yesterday was so very grey.
Last night I met my friend and he said
“yes it’s been a grey, blue day”.
Why is it that when it is grey
A blue heart often comes to stay?
Today I am hoping for, blue sky.
Perhaps the blueness from my heart will fly
to join the colour in the sky.
And leave my heart with a different hue.
One that’s full of joy and true.
If only I can remember the colour it was.
Vibrant pink or gentle green or raucous red?
Or was it just a pure clear canvas
on which we write our dreams
and paint a rainbow of emotions?
