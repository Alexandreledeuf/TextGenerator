💓 💏 💓
We married, on your birthday!
In San Francisco City Hall.
There was no family present,
Just you and I~ that's all!
We were two very young, and
very much in love elopers.
Nothing stood in our way, we
were over-comers, not life-copers.
Who drove from frozen, blizzardly
Chicago to our foggy city by the bay.
We chose to live our lives in our own
unique artistic way.
There was no wedding reception,
no gifts, no band.
Just a couple divinely in love, and
Panagiota so proud to wear that gold
wedding band!
Death took you from this life,
when you were still very young.
But her love for you, remains a song,
that everyday is sung.
And this forever young bride cannot forget
that day.
The sun, the Cable Cars, the glorious fog,
as her tears now fall into San Francisco Bay!
Rest in peace, my love!
Panagiota💐
