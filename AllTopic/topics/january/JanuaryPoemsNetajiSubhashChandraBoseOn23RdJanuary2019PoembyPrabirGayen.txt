-Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose -(2)
It was the time when India was
under The British rule
and servitude for all.
The darkness all around
the lap of mother.
Bleeding and crying for help
for dewy fall.
'A drop of blood', He pronounced to shedfrom all.
Tearing the Shadow of bondage,
he uttered,
The words of love and
compassion for men.
Netaji the beloved of nation,
The saviour of multitude Hapless.
When the sky was red and
the air was Stodgy,
The people were accustomed
to endless disgrace,
Roared He the battle cry to free India,
The great monk the priest of purity,
burst forth.
From Singapore did he inspire the drooping,
The spineless nation to raise the wings of fire.
A great battle was fought under his care,
And India got freedom healing the mother.
