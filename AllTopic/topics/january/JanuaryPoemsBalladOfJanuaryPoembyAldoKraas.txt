January
Is
A new month
A new start for me
To learn new things
To learn to let go of my anger
And open up my heart
And to listen to what my heart
Is saying
It is waking up
From a long painful journey
Of last summer
I love you all the time
Sunsets
January
Thanks god you are mild
Because I hate the cold
