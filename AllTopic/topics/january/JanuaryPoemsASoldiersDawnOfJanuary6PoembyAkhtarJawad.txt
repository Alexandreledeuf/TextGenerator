It looks like a different dawn, an amazing dawn,
earth is the same, skies are the same,
but the sun has come with a different name,
account of love with the bank of heaven, although overdrawn,
account though debited by heavy interests in advance,
but the losses incurred in the leaving year made up at a glance.
I see the aurora is melting and the earth is washed,
am I the same man who was crying in pains,
who looked so ugly with many stains,
by his own conscience in the night was lashed,
see my charms your attention I have drawn,
I am over sure it's a different dawn!
What a magic is love that brings smiles,
and turns eyes in the shining stars,
greetings exchanged by the solders at wars,
on the shoulder of air are the paper projectiles,
the dragon enemy is changed in a prawn!
Definitely my dear it's a different dawn!
A poem is written by a soldier in a trench,
wait let me see what's written on the paper,
"Your beloved is waiting with tears scrapper.
Wish to see you kissing her on a bench,
In a mini skirt bare footed on the lawn,
on her rosy cheeks is a different dawn! "
Cease fire my enemy come out come too close,
overleaf of a letter from my charming sweetheart
my blood gave color to a soldier's art,
It's front line I don't have a real rose,
celebrate and pray for the next year's dawn,
with her and with the roses of sweet home's lawn!
But this year too, for the beloveds let us celebrate,
let us wish each other the best and wait for the fate.
(During First World War, invention of Machine Guns paralyzed the war. On Christmas and other like days the fighting forces waived white flags and celebrated the happy days jointly)
