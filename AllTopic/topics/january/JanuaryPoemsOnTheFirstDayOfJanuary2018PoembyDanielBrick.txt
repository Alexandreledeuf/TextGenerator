by this double window framing
a partial view of a stark winter day,
I will eventually see a field of
yellow and red flowers, a pond
reflecting the sky's blue and

leaving behind only pieces of spring.
But winter is the master now, and it
imperiously summons me to acknowledge

It spreads its spell across white fields
punctuated by evergreen groves and frozen
ponds. And perhaps its dreams inhabit
things in hibernation, and grants them
a cold solace for the duration
of ice and snow. And the silence
will prevail until the first crack of spring.
It spreads its cold charm across white
