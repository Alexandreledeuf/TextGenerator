The freezing wind rips raw through my skin.
The sand supports my heavy form
And I couldn’t wait to take the plunge.
My mind and body are at ease -
Because there’s nobody demanding an answer,
There’s no-one to answer back.
As comfortable as sleep.
The sea breaks like pages of poetry
And I drown peacefully between the sheets.
