On a wonderful cold day in January
A beautiful full term baby girl was born.
She was full of promise, purpose and destiny.
Her parents did not know the reason behind it all.
Dad decided to keep it moving.
Mom at first tried everything she possibly can
to rid herself of this child but to no avail.
Promise wouldn't allow her.
Purpose refused her destructive actions.
Destiny kept protecting.
This innocent child came through in spite of rejection.
She was surrounded by heavenly angels the moment of conception.
On a wonderful cold day in January
A beautiful baby girl was born.
Why wasn't she born in December or February or March...
January is the first month of the year.
Which identifies her as a born leader.
All that God declared over her life is bound to come to fruition.
God sent His Word and it does not come back to Him void.
It goes forth and accomplish that which He sent it for.
God is not man that He should lie. He is God.
If He said it shall He not do it?
Without a doubt.
