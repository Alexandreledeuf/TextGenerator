the rain, it comes
down in so many ways
straight, slanted, hurried
or so slowly, lazily
it drizzles ever so slowly
- an old man trudging
through the lane -
throughout morn
until the pool is full
full, full, full with
my impatience to
visit nextdoor friend
for a round of noon football
rain April rain
it jumps in the garden
crystal upon crystal
to and fro
to and fro
down the big
yam leaves
