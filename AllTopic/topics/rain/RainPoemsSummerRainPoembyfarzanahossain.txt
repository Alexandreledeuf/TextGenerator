You ever had seen summer rain.
It comes like a wild reflection.
It goes like a bird fly away in a yawning sky.
I don’t want to let it go away.
Cause this is the most gorgeous rain I ever seen.
It keeps some memory inside of me.
Love strike like a rain drops in my heart.
I feel you in each raindrop.
It covers my face like a star casing the sky.
You ever had seen summer rain.
Sense the whisper of the rain.
So I can feel you in the summer rain.
I want to hold that thought.
It makes me passionate about you.
And it makes you smile like a cupid.
Come along with me now.
I want to enjoy this baffling rain.
That’s why I ask you?
You ever had seen summer rain.
