The moon still shines like that of ages old,
holding distant secrets like a tale yet to be told,
The sun in all its blinding beauty continues to lend us its rays,
enriching us with memories of those blisfull youthspent days.
The sea still massages the sandy golden shores,
passing from the sea gods ever open jaws.
The rain still travels from open blue skys,
showering the land as the sky god cries.
The wind whispers words of both hope and depair,
in hope it strokes the heads of ours so very fair,
The moon and the sun and the sea the rain and the wind,
do what they have done since time began,
yet Man, yes man has changed grown more hungry,
and in turn has robbed the earth of its enchanting energy,
Man has bombed, and slaughtered, and destroyed,
man has teased and tested and toyed.
And as i, a man am washed by the nightly visit of rain,
tears of fear fall in unsison with the cloudy droplets,
I was not meant for times like these,
i am a passer by a silent hooded journey man,
swaying in the comfort of the invisible breeze.
wanting and waiting with poetic patience,
to be taken away on the wings of timeless words.
