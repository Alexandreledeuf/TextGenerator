Rain, Rain! !
Fall in drops
On the parched earth
That is thirsty for years
And wait for your coming
With eager heart.
Rain, rain
Do not go away
Riding on the crest of clouds
Close your wings
And stay a while
Descend on green mountains
To touch the land
And fill the cracks
With your gift abundance.
Flow through the earth body
Like blood in vessels
Fill the ponds and rivers
Sweep the earth
With your impressions
Before you run back
To the swelling arms of sea
And ride again
On the crest of clouds
Flying away with winds
With your tapping songs.
