A dark cloud of rain
drifted into my life
And for some time,
I felt good, happy...
I no longer felt lonely.
I thought life would go on happily
In one long, long stretch of time...
But when the cold, harsh
winds of change started blowing,
The cloud of rain
had to drift away...
Life is still going on
In one long, long stretch of time...
I am not lonely.
I can't say I am sad or unhappy.
But you have left a void
That would take me
a long, long time to fill.
