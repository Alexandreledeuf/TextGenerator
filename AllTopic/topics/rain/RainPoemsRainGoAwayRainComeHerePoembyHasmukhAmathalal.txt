Rain go away, Rain come here
Friday,19th July 2019
O, dear Lord!
spare with the mercy word
your sharpened sword
it has played havoc
our lives are cut short
with no other means to report
but only offer prayers
we want you to act soothsayers
the whole country is plundered
the lives of millions are shattered
half of the country is reeling under excessive rain
causing us a lot more agony and pain
millions have shifted
but no relief is gifted
no food and no shelter
we are real sufferers
some parts are witnessing draught
and caught
unaware of your fury
it is causing concern and worry
please, pardon us
for our sins
such kind of scene
oh God! we have never seen
spare us from your unkind eye
and try to mitigate
the sufferings
please accept our offerings
