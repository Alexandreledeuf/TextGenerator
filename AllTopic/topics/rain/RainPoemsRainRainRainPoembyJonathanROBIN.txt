Rain, rain, rain
on pain's pane which is shuttered quite.
Though I would that my eye could spy
a cloudless starry night!
O well for the pilot wise
who thunderstorm avoids
by climbing through the skies –
who’s well insured by Lloyds!
O well for the submarine
in safety ‘neath the sea,
and O for the sun that has been,
what warmth it brought to me!
Alas for the climate change
which leaves us all at sea,
as the seasons, passing strange,
now topsy-turvy be!
Alas for the water course
when flash floods' water mark
marks records which, of course,
spoil carpet, garden, park!
Rain, rain, rain,
complaint I sing, the sight
brings sorrows flooding, sighs, -
O pity our pretty plight!
