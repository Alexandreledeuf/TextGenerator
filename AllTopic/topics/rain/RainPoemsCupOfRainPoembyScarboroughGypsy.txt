He’s written his rules
In invisible ink
She’s thirsty for answers
But can’t get a drink
She’s certain of nothing
And unsure of all
Like walking a tight rope
And waiting to fall
No courage to question
In case he withdraws
He might start to think
She’s sharpening her claws
She wants not to ask him
For what he can’t give her
A cup full of rain,
Won’t give you a river.
