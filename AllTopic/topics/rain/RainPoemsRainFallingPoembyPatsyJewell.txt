Well, I'm listening to the pitter-patter of the rain
Alone in the middle of the night
My ol'heart begins to feel the pain
Of missing you with all my might
But your not here to share my love
So I'll just face this pain alone...
And listen to the rain falling from above
And face the fact that you are gone
Rain falling from above...
Rain falling for my love...
Rain falling from the skies...
And rain falling from my eyes.
So I'm listening to the pitter-patter of the rain
And listening to how sad it sounds
The rain's only an indication of my pain
And eternal loneliness I've found.
