Rain, torrential rain lashing,
It ran down my neck making my collar
Damp and sticky drippy wet.
I cannot brush it aside or hide
From its attack for it is relentless.
It splashes around my feet
As I walk Clara around the lake.
The car seats will be wet again
From a summer, autumn and winter
Of relentless rain hammering down
As if the saturated earth depended on it.
Waterlogged fields and roofs: Rain dripping
From tree branches in big dollops
Exploding on the ground in front of me.
Even the robins and blackbirds lose,
Their voice, their orchestra remain silent.
Only the swans and moorhens with
Their waterproof jackets seem oblivious
And the seagulls mocking all around.
