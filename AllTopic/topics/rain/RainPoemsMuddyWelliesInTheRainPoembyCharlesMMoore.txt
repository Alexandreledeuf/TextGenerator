When I wake up my sleepy head
I've got my trousers on in bed
I'm first at the breakfast table
hair a mess and clothes dishevelled
eat my cornflakes and fly
but always kiss my mum goodbye
so she'll tidy up my room
where all around the toys are strewn
Leave the door upon the latch
so I can sneak back in and snatch
the biscuits from the biscuit tin
an apple, pear or mandarin,
In my pocket squashed in half
is a Mars bar that will last
and keep me going through the day
so I can stay outside and play
Muddy wellies in the rain
playing marbles in a drain
games of football in the park
staying out till after dark
on my bike out for a run
with my mates I'll have some fun
knock on doors and run away
or writing down car number plates
Build a campfire in the woods
be a cowboy, Robin Hood
with a band of merry men
make a tree hut for a den
I was unique I thought one day
until I heard my father say
when I was young it was the same
muddy wellies in the rain.
