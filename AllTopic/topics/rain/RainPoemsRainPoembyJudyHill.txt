Sitting in the rain as it falls on my face,
Thinking about making love is a wondrous place.
As the rain falls down my chest,
To the place that you know best.
As the rain gets harder your strokes get
stronger,
Going deeper and deeper making the process longer.
Running your fingers through
my wet hair,
Sucking my breast as you
take me there.
As my moans get louder the
rain drowns me out,
It feels so good showing me
what your man hoods about.
As the rain keep coming so do
I,
Hitting it right as you give me
that natural high.
As the ran role down my check
so do a tear,
As you sexually take away my
fears.
As your lips touch mine so do
the rain,
Holding me tight giving me that
passionate pain.
As the rain slows down I
donâ€™t want it to stop,
The rain is cool, but my
body is hot.
As the rain stop and the love
making finally ends,
I hope tomorrows forecast
say rain so we can do this again.
