The tree tops are Dead
and so are the Roots
It's the rain they Dread
also the Shoots
The rain is like Acid
it eats it all Away
should be more placid
would help in a big Way
But one Day the Trees will be Gone
It seams all the people do is Yawn
But when it is Black, Dark, and no Bark
We'll wish we were sitting in a Green Park
