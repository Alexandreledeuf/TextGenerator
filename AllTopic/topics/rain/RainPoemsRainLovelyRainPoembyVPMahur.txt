Comes from the dark cloud
That makes a noise loud
Rain, cold rain
Tinkles so softly
Like a slow moving train
Rain, happy rain
Enriched the dry land
With many a soft hand
Rain, shining rain
Like the clumps of water pearls
That comes again and again
Rain, heavy rain
Relieving the overpowering heat
Whether a hill or a plain
Rain, dumping rain
Filling the street with water
Turning it into the overflowing drain
Rain, drizzling rain
Making the children cheerful
Forgetting all their pain
