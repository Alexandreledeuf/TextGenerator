She, under her
Big smile stows
away
the unhappy memories
she wants to be
the perfect happy
person in
this world and
everyone would love
Her and she
Kids
herself, she kids
herself of what
she really
is And she is
the empty shell
waiting to be filled
And she is
the little los   t   orphan
waiting to be found
And she is
the  blank  book
waiting to be written in
and she is
hollow.
