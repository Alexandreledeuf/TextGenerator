I'm just a girl, a hopeless case.
Living in the world a familier place.
I'm just a girl, with tears in her eyes.
Swimming in a pool of cold hearted lies.
I'm just a girl, always second best.
With sleepless nights and no time to rest
I'm just a girl, with scars all around.
Always screaming with out a sound
I'm juts a girl, giving up on life.
Running from my problems headed for the knife
I'm just a girl, who's messed up in the head.
With hope and wishes and prayers to be dead
I'm just a girl, with nothing to live for.
Who shut out the world and fell to the floor.
I'm just a girl, living in fear
In the dark lonely place, flooded with tears.
I'm just a girl, behind closed doors,
soon to be gone and live no more.
