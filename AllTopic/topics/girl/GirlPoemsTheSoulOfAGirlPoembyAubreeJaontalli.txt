Look upon this face, what do you see
A Girl with wondering eyes and a dancing soul
Secrets that will never be told
Mysteries that are so strange that few would understand
She holds the world in the palm of her hand
Dreams and wishes are shown in the smile
And her gleaming eyes can be seen over a mile
Her pressures and fears she hides behind her back
Her emotions can be seen like that!
The key to her heart is locked up tight
For she doubts she will meet the one that's just right
To be strong is harder that you would believe
Its like trying to fly away even though you would never leave
Her spirit soars high above the sky
And she dreams of a better place...
Sometimes its simply lying in the rye
