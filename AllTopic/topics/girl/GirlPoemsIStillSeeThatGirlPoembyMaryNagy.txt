I see the girl of innocence
that you at one time were.
You have to take your life back.
You owe that much to her.
She needs you to unclutter
the hurt you've filed away.
The memories of tragedy
and the things you never say.
If your heart is filled with sadness
where's the room for happiness?
That girl deserves attention
and she'll stand for nothing less!
Your soul is not a graveyard
for you to bury all your pain.
You can't hold in the feelings
that are driving you insane.
Purge your hate and anger.
Pour your darkness out.
Let your pain be recognized.
Hollar, scream, and shout!
No matter what it takes
just let her feel she's loved.
Don't allow her to be beaten,
abused....pushed and shoved.
That girl I know is hurting.
That girl deserves the best.
Make ''you'' a priority
and you will pass His test.
**For my sister Danielle.  I still see that innocent girl from our childhood.  I hope you see her too.  Love, Mary
