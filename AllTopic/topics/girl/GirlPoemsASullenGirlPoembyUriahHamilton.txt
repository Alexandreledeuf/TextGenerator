I quietly walk immense, lonely streets
And think of a sullen girl
Whose eyes were always
Watery and sad,
Even in the absence of tears.
I recall once having held her hand
In the sunlight amid yellow flowers
And wanting to whisper something to her
That would make her smile
And forget her tragic soul
For a fleeting moment.
Some girls dress in black
And you can’t reach them with romance,
But you fall in love with them nonetheless;
The poetry of their melancholy eyes
Slips into your psyche
Like a recurring childhood dream.
She eventually gets lost somewhere
And drifts away, she finds it impossible to linger
With one man and be understood.
You think, perhaps this is best,
She’s not for you,
But your life becomes morose,
Her disconsolate mood has infected you
And you begin to view the world
Through the same saturnine eyes.
In your solitude, you question why
The two of you could not remain
Unhappy together?
