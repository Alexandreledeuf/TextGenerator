This Girl In The Dark
Has a beautiful face without a name
And a beautiful smile to hide the pain
This Girl In the Dark
Has cuts up her arm
Loves nothing more then self harm
This Girl in the dark
Doesn’t know how much longer she can keep trying
Everyday she’s slowly dying
This Girl in the Dark
Sits all alone
Wants a place to truly call home
This Girl in the dark
Wants nothing more then to be free
I know this because this Girl is me
