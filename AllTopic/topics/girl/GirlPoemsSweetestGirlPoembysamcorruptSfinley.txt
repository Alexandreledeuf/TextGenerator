You’re the sweetest girl I ever met
Beautiful eyes like a rising sunset
A face as stunning as an angels glow
Her elegant heart as pure as her soul
A smile that could cheer up a sad man
Gentle hands there to help you stand
Angelic feathers fall whenever she goes
She’s a holy angel that has a cute nose
Long hair shining like the moon light
Her voice displays rhythm and might
A body that has committed no crimes
Reminisces of the sad and happy times
Never lets the world around get her down
She never lets her a smile turn into a frown
She might not be the greatest girl out there yet
But she still remains the sweetest girl I ever met
