Girl, when I look at your eyes
I see all of your genuine charms
I want to give you my everything
Including the moon and the stars
You're the one that I love
You're always in my heart
I think of you in every way
Whether you are near or far
Girl, you know how much I love you
You are my everything
Anything in this world, I would do for you
Love and tenderness is what I'll always bring
I could not love no one else
That's how special you are to me
They say that love is blind
But now we're able to see
Nothing could ever come between us
We have a special bond
We can stand on our own two feet
Our love for each other will continue to live on
