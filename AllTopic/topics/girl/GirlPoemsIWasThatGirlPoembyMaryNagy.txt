I was that girl...in the shadows
of an ever-dying love.
I was that girl...searching for God
just begging for help from above.
I was that girl...in the darkness
trying to find my way.
I was that girl...raised in violence
and then selfishly thrown away.
I was that girl...full of anger
for the past and all of the pain.
I was that girl....but now I'm not
and I'll never be her again.
