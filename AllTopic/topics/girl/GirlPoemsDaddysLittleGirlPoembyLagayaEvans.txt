Always in my mind
I can see my daddy's face
As he took me in his arms
Enveloped me with his embrace
Daddy always held my hand
With that great big hand of his
Said, I was his little princess
Go ahead a make a wish
Many times I would fall down
And skin my knees
He would always come running
Oh, baby, let me see!
He told me when I grew up
I would be somebodies queen
But for now his little girl
The most prettiest he's ever seen
I would set in my daddy's lap
I felt I was on a thrown
Not knowing oh, to soon
I would be almost grown
My daddy's my hero
Someone I want to be
When I grow up daddy
I'll make you proud of me
I guess I'll always be
That little girl that needs her dad
I'll treasure every moment
Every memory that we have
Time can be so unkind
Live today but a memory tomorrow
I just want to stay daddy's little girl
If time we could only borrow
Memories flood my mind
Just like I was ten
Daddy can you play a game with me
He gently takes my chin
You'll always be my little girl
If only in our minds
Daddy, daddy you can't catch me
Your it,  It's your turn to hide
Daddy's are a gift from God
Made especially for little girls
I love you so much daddy
You are my great big world
