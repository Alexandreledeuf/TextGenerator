Wow! I would love a girl,
a girl who is an individual,
who doesn’t just fall in the crowd,
who doesn’t just do what her friends do.
Someone who is real ya’ know,
that might be too much to ask,
but it just seems every girl I know,
has never done something on there own,
done anything for themselves,
or truly ever wanted be somebody else.
If I could find a girl like that,
they might just be worth getting,
but until that day, good luck girls,
try not to be so fake!
