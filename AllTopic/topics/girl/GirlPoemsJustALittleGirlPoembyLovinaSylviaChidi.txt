You subjected her to a night of hell
Hey! Did you know?
She was just a little girl
You took her to a run down motel
Hey! Did you know?
She was just a little girl
Now you hold her crying soul to sell
Hey! Did you know?
She was just a little girl
When you forced her out of her shell
Hey! Did you know?
She was just a little girl
Couldnâ€™t you tell by her face?
She had the smile of an angel
A virgin waiting for wedding bells
Hey! Did you know?
You are not well?
The only place you belong is a cell
With horrifying smells!
Hey! Did you know?
She is no more a little girl, they yell
