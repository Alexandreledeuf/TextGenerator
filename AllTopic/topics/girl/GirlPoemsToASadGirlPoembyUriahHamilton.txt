There is no way to explain
Unending sorrow and grief,
No way to kiss a young girlâ€™s cheek
In a way that would give her back
The joy death has stolen.
Humans are brave enough
To live and bleed and die,
But to be the one remaining
As others say goodbye
Is too much to withstand.
There are evil stars that smirk
And thus mark us for treacherous fates,
The days all burn like desert fields
Until there is nothing left to love
And nothing left to feel.
