I'm looking for a girl who's right for me,
One who knows how to talk intelligently,
She'll laugh at all my jokes,
And ignore the other blokes,
And find that I am just her cup of tea.
The task is not so easy, I have found,
There aren't that many 'right' ones still around,
But if they're out there somewhere,
And if any of them might care,
To find me, then I won't be going to ground.
My charisma can be in itself impressive,
My conversation I know is quite expressive,
I am kind in word and deed,
And I think you will concede,
That I wouldn't be someone who'd be repressive.
I can say that I'm a very balanced chap,
Who, when the going's tough would never flap,
But I'm really keen to find,
A lady of like mind,
Who in fact could quite ideally fill the gap.
So I'm hoping that this lady turns up soon,
Perhaps it could be this very afternoon,
I would greet her with a smile,
Which would certainly beguile,
And my vibrant personality should make her swoon.
So, do you think, that I could really have a chance,
Do you think that she would give me just one glance,
If this 'Miss Right' doesn't show,
That would really be a blow,
And put an end to all my thoughts of true romance.
No, there's got to be a girl who's right for me,
I won't believe there isn't, so soon you'll see,
An attractive lady on my arm,
A lady with such charm,
That eventually we'd become a Royal 'We'.
