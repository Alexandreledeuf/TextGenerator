Thank you--she is my friend
It's a rare positive
She cares like a sister would
I'm also there for her
Like a big brother should
She makes me laugh
At times when I want to be alone
She feels my pain
Because we come from the same home
It's nice to know someone like this
She's moving away soon
Her cookie girl ways, I will miss
We both lost friends along the way
We're both losers, as people would say
Someone once told me
Things happen for a reason
She deserves the best
I'm just a friend, but not like the rest
Theres a bond we could see
Only cookie girl really understands me.
