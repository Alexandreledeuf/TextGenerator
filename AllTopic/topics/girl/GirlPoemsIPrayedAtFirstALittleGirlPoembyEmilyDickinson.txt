576
I prayed, at first, a little Girl,
Because they told me to—
But stopped, when qualified to guess
How prayer would feel—to me—
If I believed God looked around,
Each time my Childish eye
Fixed full, and steady, on his own
In Childish honesty—
And told him what I'd like, today,
And parts of his far plan
That baffled me—
The mingled side
Of his Divinity—
And often since, in Danger,
I count the force 'twould be
To have a God so strong as that
To hold my life for me
Till I could take the Balance
That tips so frequent, now,
It takes me all the while to poise—
And then—it doesn't stay—
