Girl, why don't you dry those tears
You have so much to live for
Things will not always be like this
There is so much more in store
I know that your boyfriend has did you wrong
He has torn your poor heart in two
Sometimes you feel so unsure of yourself
And you just don't know what to do
Just pick your heart up from off the floor
And start again
Many other guys want to get that chance to meet you
There are other fish in the ocean
It really hurts to suffer
Nothing but grief and sorrow
Keep your head up and smile
For there will always be tomorrow
