So many memories we've made together.
As the years have slowly passed.
Tears may have been cried
but our laughter drownedthem all out.
Sharing my deepest most secrets
'Till one in the morning.
Talking forever about things
until our words just ran out.
But now you must leave,
and I stay behind
Who will I call
when I just need to talk.
Who will I lean on
when my problems weigh me down?
Who's jokes will i laugh at?
Who will make me smile? ?
I can't tell you the answers
to the questions I have.
But I want you to know
I will always love you as my best friend.
And when my heart is troubled
I will think of you.
Remember the times of joy we have shared,
and maybe it will make you smile.
And since you can't take me with you
take the memories we have made
and cherish them as I always will.
