There are faces,
I remember.
Like pearls in the sand,
Diamonds among shells.
Faces I remember,
The Great One,
And Bogart,
Elvis and John.
'Everyone dies...'
But you don't miss everyone,
You just miss faces.
Like an old pet,
A first kiss,
A lost love.
I guess we owe them thanks,
I guess we do.
Thanks for the memories,
How sweet they are.
