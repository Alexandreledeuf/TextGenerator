When I looked into your eyes,
I knew it was true-
My heart never lies-
I was in love with you.
As you stood there
Just looking around
My whole body melted
into the ground.
I remember the day,
I remember the time,
I remember the place,
It is always on my mind.
You looked so good
In your shirt and jeans.
I remember that night
You were in my dreams.
I wished I could be with you
day after day,
Because I love you more
than words can ever say.
