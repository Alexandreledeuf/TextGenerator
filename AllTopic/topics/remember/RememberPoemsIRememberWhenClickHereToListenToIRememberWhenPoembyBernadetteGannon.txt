I remember when
Contry schools were in!
One teacher for K - 8
Always attentive and never late
Other kids brown bags more to fuss
Baked potatoes atop the furnace
Snow forts, games, Fox and Goose
Workup at softball, hang in there loose
How about those connections state?
Spelling contests and tests relate
Christmas programs and holidays
Valentine frill box, all those ways
Now to bring things up-to-date
To greet kindergarten teacher was my fate
53 years of time to span
Remembering clearly my whole clan
