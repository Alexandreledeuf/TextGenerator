See window sills,
And laughter smiles,
Funny walks,
When you were a child,
Singing songs out in the rain,
The sorrow, the heartache,
And the pain.
Such are the things of memories,
Times and laughters of the mind,
Times with you alone with me,
Times my mind must let me see.
Do you remember
Those times with me?
Do you remember?
Will your mind let you see?
And do you ever think of me?
Where I am, or who I'm seeing?
Do you remember us by the sea?
Do you, can you, remember me?
If not, then remember please,
That I remember you.
