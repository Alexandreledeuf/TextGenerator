Can I describe with words,
what has no features?
Can I describe with music,
what has no sound?
Can I describe with colour,
what cannot be seen?
Can I describe with action,
what does not move?
Can I describe with numbers,
what has no dimension?
Where all else fails
poetry begins to show
a world that few can mention.
But every one does know
this world which quietly
hides from our inattention.
It’s that which finds you
only when you’re willing
and all about is stilling.
Do you remember?
