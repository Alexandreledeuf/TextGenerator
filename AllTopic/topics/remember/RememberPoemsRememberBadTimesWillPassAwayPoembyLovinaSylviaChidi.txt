When love has left you
Feeling low and blue
Remember
Bad times will pass away
They may sometimes seem long
But are not bound to stay
When times are hard
And you are low on wad
Feeling lonely and sad
Right in your backyard
Remember
Bad times will pass away
They may sometimes seem long
Hang in there be strong
You have done no wrong
When you have nothing else to play
Except your last joker card
And people think you've gone completely mad
Please don't resort to being bad
Remember
Bad times will pass away
They may sometimes seem long
But are not bound to stay
Miracles do happen
Only if you and only you believe!
For those who love you safely from a distance
Remember it for the time
When they want your friendship enhanced
