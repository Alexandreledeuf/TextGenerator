Do you remember when we would laugh because we thought alike?
It’s over.
Do you remember when we would dream of our future, laughing
in the face of all likelihood?
It’s over.
Do you remember when you hurt, and i could do nothing for it, but love you- which i did, without holding back for anything?
It’s over.
Do you remember falling in love?
It’s over.
Do you remember being friends, but wanting more?
It’s over.
Why is it over?
Don’t you remember the feeling?
Don’t you want what you said you wanted, then?
Do you remember what you said you wanted?
Why is it over?
I never ended it,
And I never would.
Why did you?
Don’t you remember?
