The river in December
Do you remember?
When time was graying
Old leaves decaying?
We walked by that water,
That mindless water.
Watching two leaves in their reflection
Swept away without direction.
We walked by that water,
That mindless water.
Following them until we were frozen
For there was no end to that way once chosen.
