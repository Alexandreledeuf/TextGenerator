Remember me on a lonely day
When sadness takes you to a place
You do not want to go.
I’ll bring you roses to ease the pain
And provide you with a melody of hope;
We’ll walk to your favorite café,
Have a cappuccino, and talk about
Dreams we cannot let escape:
Children playing on Saturday,
Church bells chiming on Sunday,
An afternoon matinee,
Everything that makes
Life beautiful and true.
Dear Lady, if you’re ever too hurt
To make it through on your own,
Please remember me.
