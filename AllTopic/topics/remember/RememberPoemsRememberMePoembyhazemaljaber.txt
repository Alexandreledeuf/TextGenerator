remeber me every day, when a sun rise..
when breeze up from our place to yours....
when you saw any one like me...
when every time you lights a cigarette...
i rememberd you in a night closed to be dawn..
and don`t forget me...
don`t forget me...
at when a breeze stoped...
and when you finished your cigarette...
i`m in loving with you, and you have to...
i`m in remembering you, so don`t forgot me....
iam loving you as became a mania...
so.. you have to love me, a love with out mania..
because i don`t like a craziness..
my love become more to you, when.....
when i light a cigarette from yours..
when i remeberd your friend, who let us knew each others..
and because of her i write, what i wrote...
and when i saw any girl like your prettiness...
so please..
i loved you so, and you have to...
and rememberd you, don`t forget....
