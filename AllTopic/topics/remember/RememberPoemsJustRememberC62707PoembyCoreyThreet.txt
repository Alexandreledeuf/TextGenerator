I know we've been together for so long
but there's something I've never said
It's not will you marry me
or we'll be together until the day we're dead
I'm not sayin I don't want to be with you
or we'll be together forever
Because I truly do
want to be with you
But I know we may not always be together
I'm not sayin I'd die for you
even though if it came down to it I would
I'm not sayin that you are sexy
Cause you know you have always looked good
I'm not sayin if you leave me
I'll cry and cry all the time
But even though I'd be sad
Maybe I'll just find another dime
But just because the things I'm sayin
May be ignorant but still true
Just remember the day when I told you
That I truly do love you
