Early in the morning when the birds sings,
Light to this world the sun brings,
When the dew drops like pearls shine,
I remember you in this heart of mine.
When the sky is covered with blanket of clouds,
The lightning strikes and the thunder goes loud,
When the whole world drenches in rain time,
I remember you in this heart of mine.
When flowers bloom in spring season,
And smiles break out for no reason,
For romance when the weather is fine,
I remember you in this heart of mine.
In winter when the snow is all around,
And fog comes out of mouths instead of sound,
Looking at the cones of bare pine,
I remember you in this heart of mine.
When the ground is full of dried leaves in fall,
Of different colours from trees so tall,
Watching those ants busy working in a line,
I remember you in this heart of mine.
The time when love is in the air,
And roses and chocolates are everywhere,
The day of love, the day of valentine,
I remember you in this heart of mine.
In the cozy full moon night,
When cool breeze sends up chill of delight,
Tapping on the bench by my side,
I remember you in this heart of mine.
With bare feet I walk on the grass wet,
And relive the day we first met,
While listening to music with note divine,
I remember you in this heart of mineâ€¦
