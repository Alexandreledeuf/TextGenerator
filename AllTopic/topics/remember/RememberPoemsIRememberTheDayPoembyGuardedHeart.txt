I remember the day
When i saw you walk away
And i felt like i would never see you again
I cried the whole way home
And couldn't even say why
I remember the day
When i felt a little bit of my heart break
I remember it like it was yesterday
And you had nothing to say
It was my turn to walk away
I remember the day
When you first told me you loved me
I had waited so long to hear it
Even though i didn't, at first, believe it
But to hear it was so relieving
I remember the days
Of you and of me
Of everything we thought we'd be
Of everything we wanted to be
And me begging you to remember me
I'll always remember the day
When i watch you walk away
To start the next part of your life
And i'll pray to one day be a part of that walk
but i'll never forget that day
I'll remember every day
As if each moment
Happened yesterday
