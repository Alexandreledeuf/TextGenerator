I remember Mama
blowing chewing gum bubbles
to entertain us
while she ironed.
I was too young for school
Sesame Street wasn’t invented yet
the rain was pouring outside
and I was awed.
I remember Mama
sewing at her machine into the night
when she had to get up early for work
patching a favorite pair of cutoffs
just one more time
or putting pockets on pants
because my little brother adored them
and I still hear her words
‘There’s all kinds of ways to say
I love you.’
I remember Mama
teaching us that beauty on the inside
was more important than on the outside.
‘A kind word to a stranger
might be the only kind word
that person heard all day’
... and how good it felt
finding out she was right.
I remember Mama
telling us to hold onto our dreams.
Make them happen and never say ‘I can’t’
and how funny I thought it
when she said
the world was our watermelon
and all we had to do was
grab it and take a bite.
I remember Mama
who taught us best by example
with her unconditional love.
Love isn’t love until it’s given away
and it’s in the giving that we know
it truly does come back ten-fold.
I remember, Mama.
