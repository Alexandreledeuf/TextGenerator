Can't forget you
Only remember
A Grandad more unique than any other!
I don't remember much.
I will remember this,
You are my Grandad,
Who I'll deffinatley miss.
A giant afro sat above your head,
Sneak into the kitchen,
For a quick cigarette
Even if you were caught,
There were no excuses made,
Quick thinkin' smooth talker.
Someone else was to blame!
Announcing names,
For the draw on sunday,
Playing pool for the win,
Accused for a fix,
Never afraid at the night of games.
A good old laugh,
With a good old man
A jolly old fellow,
With a good long past.
You've been around for many years,
many memories to be remembered,
We wont forget you,
Becuase we cant. Its' just to hard.
even if we tried,
You would still live on
In all our lives.
I love you Grandad
