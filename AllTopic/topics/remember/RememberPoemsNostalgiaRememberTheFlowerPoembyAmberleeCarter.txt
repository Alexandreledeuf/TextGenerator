(for sean)
Remember the flower, love
blooming night. The petals
lit on fire-
a million miles of moonlight
bending from the sky,
pin pointing the infinite places, and
the dark corners I kissed you
Remember the blossom, love
early spring- suckling,
reaching for something
unworldly
What the night remembers
it plants in memory, which spawn
wings that lead to dream
as we restless, rarely sleep.
Remember the flower, love-
what it leaves behind:
nostalgic flesh, that
navigates rain and remembrance
