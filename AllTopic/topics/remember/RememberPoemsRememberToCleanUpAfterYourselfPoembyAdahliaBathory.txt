Oh yeah!
I know I’d find you!
Oh, oh, oh.
I got you like I said!
I told you I never lie.
You were built for shame.
So get up because you’re not dead.
There’s and old saying that goes like this:
“I clean up after myself when I’m tied up”
I can’t find out, No you can’t find it!
You make me sick!
You will regret this.
You owe me this.
