You smiled yesterday
When all we were to each other
Was new...
Now I reach for you and you
Only stare back at me with eyes
Cold as winter winds...
Love!
What happened to your laughter?
Where did you hide my lovers arms?
Conceal his kiss?
You smiled yesterday
When all we were to each other
Was new...
Now all has changed and
I am constant through revolving doors
Of memories.
Oh! Jealous heart!
We promised never!
But you forgot to remember.
