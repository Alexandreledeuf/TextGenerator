I remember you as a dream
A poignant painting of love
Whispering echoes of truth
I remember you as a man
Words silkily caressing my soul
Silent reminders of beauty shared
I remember you as a kiss
A stain of molten lust
Capitulating in tumultuous need
I remember you as the sea
Waves consuming our tryst
Rocking in the purity of now
I remember you as my heart
Two pounding erotically as one
Savoring confessions from afar
I remember youâ€¦
