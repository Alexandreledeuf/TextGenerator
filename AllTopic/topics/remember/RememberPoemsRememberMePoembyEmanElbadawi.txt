Dear moments, dearest, stay please don't go
Don't let long hours kill my heart
Poor heart you need me here I know
I wish to stay yet I must go
Then I'll die without you
Come come future dear moments wait for you
It's Fate who bids not you not me
It's once together once apart
Now drie your tears take what I say
When I've gone here you can still keep me
Within your heart I'll live a memory
Days come and go
Years pass quickly
Today's faithful friend
Might tomorrow betray
When years've passed
When faces changed
Might you dear friend
Remember me!
