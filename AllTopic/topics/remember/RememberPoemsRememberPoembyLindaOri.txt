Do you not remember me
The one who set your feelings free
And brought you to your knees...............
Do you not recall the days
You threw away your careless ways
And lost your heart to me....................
Do you not relive those nights
Of wild abandon - timeless flights
Into a magic place...............................
Where I was all you needed then
Oh, surely you remember when
The world was ours alone....................
The magic still remains  with me
It hurts to know that you don't see
How much those moments meant............
In quiet times I hope you know
Deep in your heart I loved you so..............
And maybe shead a tear.
