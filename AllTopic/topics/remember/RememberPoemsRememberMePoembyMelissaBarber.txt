Remember me?
I’m the one you can’t see
I’m a shadow in the dark
You can’t ignore my shadow
I’m all around
You can hear me, though
I make a quiet sound
All you can do is hear me
My voice in the dark
Oh, it’s so stark
Do you still remember me?
Come to your senses
This isn’t rocket science
I’m your conscience
It’s so dark inside your head
I think I’m going to leave instead
Remember me?
