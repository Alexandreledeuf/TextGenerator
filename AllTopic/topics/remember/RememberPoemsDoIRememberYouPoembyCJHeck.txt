Do I remember you
from so many years ago?
The man with a gentle touch
and loving hands,
the softest shoulder
to cry upon...
budding passion,
almost lovers,
undermined and rent by fate...
So many miles away...
the years have passed,
our mirrors echo
youthful faces all aglow,
lives lived on tandem shores.
As silent arms reach through the ages
spanning years from then to now,
unseen fingers ply the keyboard
filling in the time between.
Love and memories come flooding
into present from the past
and I cry from just one letter.
Yes, I do remember you.
