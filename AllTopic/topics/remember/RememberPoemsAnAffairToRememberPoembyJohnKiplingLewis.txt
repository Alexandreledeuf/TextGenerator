We share the same cabin while the rest of the passengers sleep.
Jack and Coke for two, we spill out our lives... our love.
Yours lost, mine found.
For the voyage we fall in love and in that cabin the stewards talk about us behind our backs.  You tell me I have a special spirit, but I don't believe in such things.  I tell you that you amaze me with your tenacity and drive, but you don't believe in such things.
At the end you kiss my hands with tears in your eyes.
No one will wait at the Empire State building.
The entire affair ends when we depart, never repeated except in our memories.
I'll just take my ego for a walk.
