If tomorrow doesn’t come
Please forget all the fights
But please remember my face.
If tomorrow doesn’t come
Please forget the name calling
But please remember the smiles.
If tomorrow doesn’t come
Please forget the down times
But please remember our laughter together.
If tomorrow doesn’t come
Please forget the lonely nights crying
But please remember the many hugs after those nights.
If tomorrow doesn’t come
Please forget the yelling
But please remember the good talks after.
If tomorrow doesn’t come
Please remember how much I care about you
Even though I don’t show it.
Please remember how much of an impact you have on my life.
Even though I don’t help you to acknowledge it.
Please remember how much I love you
Even though we fight more than we talk to each other.
Please remember that you are apart of what I am today
Even though I don’t ever say anything.
Please remember that I always care about you
Even though I am always in your business or your life too much than usual.
Please remember to smile if tomorrow doesn’t come
Please remember that I tried to make something out of your life and mine too.
Please remember my laughter
Please remember that I think of you everyday
Even though I don’t make contact with you.
So if tomorrow never comes
Please remember the good times more than the bad
Please remember to make the best of life and never be too sad.
