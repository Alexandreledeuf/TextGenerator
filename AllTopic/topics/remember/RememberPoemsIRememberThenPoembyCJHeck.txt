I remember many things
about those days and you.
I remember staring into brown eyes
as though I couldn't get enough of them,
then burning the love I saw there
into a memory to keep for all time.
I remember how with you,
total silence could be so comfortable,
and how it was the only time
in my life I ever felt that to be so.
I remember how safe I felt with you.
Even the way you said my name
was different from how others said it
and I remember feeling
that even my name
was safe in your mouth.
I remember how sometimes
we made love all night
and stayed in bed all day,
then skinny dipping
to cool down
all the secret places
our lovemaking heated up.
I remember lying in your arms
in the afterglow and thinking
how profound it was,
the way the brain hitched a ride
when the body did all the work.
You were my miracle
in our own short season,
and it makes me remember
the last time I saw you
because I will never forget
the pain of my loss.
