I remember when you said I love you
I remember when I said yeah me too
I remember when you said love me
I remember when you carved our names in that old oak tree
I remember our first kiss
and I ignored the fact that you missed
I remember when you said together...always
I remember when I stood in front of you dazzled and amazed
I remember the sparkle in your eyes and
I remember the tears you made me cry
I remember when I could never be truly honest with you
I remember me packing, and you asking is there anything that I can do
I remember when I looked into your eyes and
I remember when we said our goodbyes
