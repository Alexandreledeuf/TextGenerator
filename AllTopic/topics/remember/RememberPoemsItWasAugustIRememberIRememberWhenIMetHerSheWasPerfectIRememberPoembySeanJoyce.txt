It was August I remember
I remember when I met her
She was perfect I remember
in her body, mind and soul
In September I remember
I remember her all over
She was perfect I remember
in her body, mind and soul
In October I remember
I remember her all over
We were lovers I remember
in body, mind and soul
In November I remember
I remember lies she told me
She was wilful I remember
Wilful to the n'th degree
In December I remember
I remember it was over
Still, she is all that I remember
Love forever sweet Nicole
