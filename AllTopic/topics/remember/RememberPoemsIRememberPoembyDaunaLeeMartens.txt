I remember going to your house,
Staying up till the early hours of morning
I remember shaving our legs together,
And putting on lotion;
I remember when we went to Winnipeg just a few weeks ago,
And tried on the really good-smelling perfume
I remember going to the park together,
Sometimes at lunch, sometimes after school
I remember “doing our homework”,
When really we just wanted to be together
I remember the first time you took me to your youth,
And saturate,
And our much fun we had
I remember having sleepovers,
How I would always fall asleep before you
I remember just this past year when,
For Christmas, you gave me love and reindeer socks
I remember writing notes to each other,
In class,
Sometimes getting caught, most often not
I remember using this type of font to do our E.L.A homework,
Of course waiting till the last minute
I remember your hugs and how you were most often there,
Even when I acted like a bear
I remember us being annoyed at each other a lot,
But we always made up the next day
I remember how cheesy this poem may be,
But I just wanted to say,
I love you **, and I will remember you till we meet again
