remember
the curiosity
as a child
the stirring
in the heart
the first time
you saw
a hornbill,
a crane
that had
set wings
to your imagination
of colours,
feathers, and flight
an elephant
such giant honest creature
you could get them
walk in a line
down the circus
their trunks
trumpeting  a song
livening up childhood years
the strong stench
of ammonia
from their  hair,
never a repellent
to shun them
walk, walk, walk,
they saunter
down your dream
and childhood lane
after so many years
the giant  elephants
that remain
the fondest of  pets
illusive pets
that grace
a dozen stories written,
painted with them
remember
the million trees
in the forests
are to fire
the imagination
of  the world
of the cuddly,
strange creatures in them
to light up
that  inquisitive spirit
in all of us
to learn and
explore
every living creature
from the mouth of moms,
books, and neighbours
remember
the trees
stand in a straight line
as guards of honour
to salute that child
in your heart
that runs
the length and breath
of  your mind,  soul
the essence of your personality
the elephants trumpeting a song
inspired by
Remember
Remember me when I am gone away,
Gone far away into the silent land;
When you can no more hold me by the hand,
Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.
Remember me when no more day by day
You tell me of our future that you plann'd:
Only remember me; you understand
It will be late to counsel then or pray.
Yet if you should forget me for a while
And afterwards remember, do not grieve:
For if the darkness and corruption leave
A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,
Better by far you should forget and smile
Than that you should remember and be sad.
Christina Georgina Rossetti
