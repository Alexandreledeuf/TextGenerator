Always remember to ignore
The drawbacks that made you sad,
But never ignore to remember
The events that made you glad.
Always remember to ignore
The associates that proved untrue,
But never ignore to remember
Those that were loyal to you.
Always remember to ignore
The worries that have faded away,
But never ignore to remember
The bliss that comes your way.
