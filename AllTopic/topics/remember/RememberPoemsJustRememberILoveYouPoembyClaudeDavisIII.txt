When you're feeling down and blue
Just remember I love you.
When people have been mean and untrue
Just remember I love you.
When you feel sad and depressed
Just remember I love you.
When you're lonely and feel the pain in your chest
Just remember I love you.
No matter what state of mood you're in
Just remember I love you.
I hope this simple phrase gives you comfort within...
Just remember I will always love you.
