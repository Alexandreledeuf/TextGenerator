will you remember me
when im gone
will you ever think of me
when you are alone
will you remember me
on a dark rainy night
will you remember our laughs
and our silly fights
will you remember me
in the early morn
will you ever think of me
and our time forlorn
will you remember me
as me
not as someone
i couldnt be
will you remember me
when im not there
will you ever miss me
or do you really care
