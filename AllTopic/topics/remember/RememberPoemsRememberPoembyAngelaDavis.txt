I remember
hiding, crying,
cowering, screaming,
begging God to end my life
I remember
my disappointment
in waking each and every day
and how I cursed his name, in anger
I remember
so many years
wasted in despair
as I died a little each day
I remember
the day I was freed
badly frightened I was
that there was nothing left of me
I remember
falling in love
and finally feeling
that I truly am alive
I remember
what I was before
thankful for what I am
and for oh so much more
I will remember
the life I have been shown
that was given me by those I love
It is all of you I will forever remember
