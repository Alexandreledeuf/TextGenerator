Rise ye up in the morning
And speak unto Me,
That I might guide thy step.
Throughout the day
In those quiet moments.
Remember Me that we be not far apart.
In the evening,
Lay thy head down unto Me,
For I shall speak of how I love thee.
In sleep, dream of Me,
For there, we are together again,
Walking side by side.
Commune with Me in these little ways
And, I will in no wise forget thee,
Or our time spent together,
For I will lift thee up
Out of the Fire and bring unto Me
A clean soul to embrace,
And forever we shall walk together
In the garden of My “Highest Kingdom”
You and I together,
Forever in Me,
Amen.
