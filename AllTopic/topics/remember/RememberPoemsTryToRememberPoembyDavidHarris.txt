When you are feeling down,
try to remember all the good things you have had,
and I will bet you,
they are many more than the bad.
We tend to remember only
all the bad things in our lives,
and the good things get stored away
for a rainy day we say.
Now if we remember,
all the good things in our life,
we would not be so unhappy
when the bad things come along.
