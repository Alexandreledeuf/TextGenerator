Here today and gone tomorrow
I pass through life
Touched by souls both good and bad
I pass through life
And here I sit thinking back in reflection
As I pass through life
All the souls that came and went
As I past through life
In the moon tree of reflection I whisper
Please remember me
For the polarity of my moods
Please remember me
Fragile is the heart that hurt you
Strong is the heart that healed you
Peace is the heart that remembers you
Like Dantes Prayer
Please remember me!
