There is nothing but mystery
Around every fleeting kiss
As we crawl on the beach
After prowling all night like cats,
I wish we were entwined on a city roof
Completely naked in the moonlight,
I’m not satisfied with anemic dreams
Or love making that utters quiet squeaks,
I’ve made offerings to Aphrodite,
Remember that when I fondle your breasts,
Our hearts are tangled in a sensual web,
There is water from soft lakes on your skin,
I’m going to dive into your soul and swim,
Let this relationship blossom into poetic myth,
Let future scholars interpret it,
Every lesson of illicit love will spring from our book.
