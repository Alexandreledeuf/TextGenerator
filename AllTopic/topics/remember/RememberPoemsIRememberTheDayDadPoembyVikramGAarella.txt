I remember the day dad,
When you chased me around, to get me to hospital
For the treatment of fever which I had.
I remember the day dad,
When you scolded me and hit me
And later how you felt bad.
I remember the day dad,
When for the first time you took me to school
Leaving me there, how you felt sad.
I remember the day dad,
When I got into medical college
And with happiness you went mad.
I remember the day dad,
In your village, in front of your elders
How you behaved like an obedient lad.
I remember the day dad,
When we both felt upset
As India lost a test match in Trinidad.
I remember the day dad,
When I was feeling low and had lost all hope
But you always had a word of encouragement and advise to add.
I remember these entire days dad,
I cherish the memories of us together
To have had a father like you I am really lucky and glad.
I remember each and every day,
When you had so many things to do
And I always learnt something from you.
