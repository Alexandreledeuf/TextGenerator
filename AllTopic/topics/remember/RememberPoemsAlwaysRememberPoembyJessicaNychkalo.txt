Always remember to forget
The things that made you sad
But never forget to remember
The things that made you glad
Always remember to forget
The friends that proved untrue
But never forget to remember
Those that have stuck by you
Always remember to forget
The troubles that have passed away
But never forget to remember
The blessings that come each day
