Remember little jack sprat
Remember three little pigs
Remember all those fairy tales
That seemed so real to us a kids
Remember mother goose
Remember Cinderella going to the ball
Remember the old lady in the shoe
Remember sleeping beauty eyes closed and all
Remember growing up and out
Remember getting rid of baby things
Remember watching Disney
And not singing barney songs we used to sing
Remember getting grow up
Remember sleeping in big kid beds
Remember ditching Barbie dolls
And tiring to flush their heads
Remember going to jr. high
Remember how scary it seemed
Remember getting used it
But not to getting picked last on teams
Remember when people had cliques
Remember when you were not part one
Remember when people started acting weird
But with your friends you still had fun
Remember eight-gread graduation
Remember high school seeming tough
Remember the day you got there
And it really wasn’t that rough
Someday you’ll look back
And remember doing this too
It seems weird now but
But it depends on your attitude
