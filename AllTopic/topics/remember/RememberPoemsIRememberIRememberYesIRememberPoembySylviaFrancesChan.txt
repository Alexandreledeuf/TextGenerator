i remember,
i remember, yes,
i remember,
when we were
in September
on late summer
near the Black Sea,
i was with you and he,
upon a dead calm sea,
you remember too?
our eldest son four years old, intelligent enough to swim,
but he hardly reached the brim,
the edge of the beaches where to begin,
alike as he had begun,
to swim for fun,
upon that dead calm sea
i remember,
i remember, yes,
i remember,
when we were there
in September....
