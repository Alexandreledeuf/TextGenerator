Mr. Johnson you silly little boy
Disregard those outrageous assumptions
The hands of time will continue to progress
So only you are to blame for your failures my son
That was hundreds of years ago
Circumstances are different now
Legislation has been passed
Racism is now a serious crime
Success awaits you my boy
New opportunities are breathing life
Each and every day
So forget all that non-sense about slavery
But for Gods sake, Remember the holocaust
I realize your ancestors where kidnapped,
Raped beaten and tortured
“Red drops trickling from the wounds of Ancient crimes”
What on imagination you have
The hands of time will continue to progress
Racism is now a serious crime
Disregard those outrageous assumptions
You were brainwashed with
Only you are to blame for your failures my boy
So forget all that non-sense about
Bondage and Slavery
But for God’s sake Mr. Johnson
Remember the Holocaust
