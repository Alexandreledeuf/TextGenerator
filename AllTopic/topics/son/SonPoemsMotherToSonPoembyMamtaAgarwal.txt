My son has belled the CAT,
But he wants to study at Rotterdam.
I quizzed why you want to go away
, When you have got into top MBA programme,
Right here so near home.
Please don’t leave us alone.
He said, ' Mom the global exposure
I will get there won’t be possible in Indore.
I will be studying with an international community,
With Nobel laureates on the faculty.
It will give an enriching experience.'
But son we will be poorer by several lakhs.
He looked at me with concern in his eyes,
And said I don’t want to stress you guys.
Maybe then I should study here,
I felt happy just to hear,
That he was willing to compromise
On his long cherished dreams.
I patted his back and said to him,
Go out into the world and spread your wings.
But always remember,
Your roots are here.
Come back home after you have broadened
Your horizons.
Right now India is a happening place,
And I hear is attracting lots of expats.
It will be a good idea
To explore your options here.
Set up your own enterprise,
This is my parting advice.
Come back and make your country proud
Just don’t end being a part of the crowd.
CAT is an entrance exam for top buisness scools in India
