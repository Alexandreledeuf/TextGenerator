Why does it have to be this way
but i love him anyway
when will he stop
when will he learn
i just dont understand.
He makes his life so uneasy
it that suppost to please me
why does he do the things he does
to fight for a love he once lost.
my head hurts from all the stress
when all i asked him was to get dressed.
comments please.....thank you
