Something has gone wrong with meaning of words,
'Sun' and 'Son' beautiful creation of lords,
Both represent energy having sharpness of swords,
Both are crucial for survival and existence of world,
Son is embodiment of energy and power,
Darkness disappears when sun rays appear,
All worship Sun god and offer prayer
Light may appear through clouds from layer
Son is source of great hope and despair,
Damage caused may be more and beyond repair,
Sun renders service which we can't compare,
Rising daily from east and non appearance rare,
Parent pray for sun to have light in home,
Worshiping many Gods and visiting Rome
Hoping lamp in huts to light and shine,
Praying for son to almighty and divine,
Sun may have power with scorching heat,
Son may also show some kind of daring feat,
Each may be scoring and beating record,
One may prove……………………..
Sun may hide face in dark night,
Parents may cry for son during day light,
Daily scuffles on with wordy fight,
Whom do we blame for want of light?
Many may be blessed with intelligent son,
They should always rejoice with simple reason
Greed may run high with aim only gain,
Parent should not keep that only aim
Many parents may not come out and openly speak,
Dryness and worry on face and future seems bleak,
Both are welcome in life and are so dear,
No parent may prefer bad words to hear
We can't afford for loss of any one
Fate may not be same as faced by everyone
The irony of fact remains almost same in nature
We should not blame anybody in near future
Is it an end of life or start of the game?
Do the children take on for simple fame?
Will situation remain for all times to come?
Will they not blame and refuse to welcome
