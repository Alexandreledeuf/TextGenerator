Dear Mother
Special wishs from your son
They say a mother's work is never done
and I can vouch for that
You've done a ton
and this day when all the thanks
doesn't seem quite enough
I know you've struggled many times
and had it so rough
an average person would have quit
and said: I've had enough
But you were always watching out for me
protecting me and by my side you'd be
So this day, is special, just for you
For all the little things you've done and do
Today take it easy and let me treat
Sit back and take a rest, put up your feet
and let me cater to you to show I care
To make your life a little more fair
I love you Mom!
Forever in my heart you'll stay!
Enjoy this Happy Mother's Day!
