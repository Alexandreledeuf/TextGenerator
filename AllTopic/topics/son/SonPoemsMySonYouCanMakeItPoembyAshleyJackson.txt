My son, you can make it
Although I am gone
You are not alone
God will see you through all of your trying times
As he sits on his throne
My son, you can make it
Please hold to God's unchanging hand
Being here was not one of God's promises
So it was meant for me to go
When the master made his call I couldn't say no
My son you can make it
To where I made it
For we will meet again face to face
When your work here is done
And thy heavenly father makes his calls for you to come one home
MY SON YOU CAN MAKE IT
