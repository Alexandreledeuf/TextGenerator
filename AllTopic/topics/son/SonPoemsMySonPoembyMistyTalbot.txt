Kai, my sensitive son.
An old soul.
So much to teach.
My son
Intelligent, quick witted,
cheeky too.
At times I will dispare,
what to do.
My son.
My son.
Whom makes my heart burst with joy.
My son, my only boy.
Inquisitive looks,
lust for life.
My son.
This little man of mine,
could not be more precious
were he made of gold.
My son
I steal into his room at night,
to watch him sleep.
Lent to me by god.
Mine for a while to keep.
My son.
