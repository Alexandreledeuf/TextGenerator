Son, son oh my dear son, dear son,
What are you doing now there?
Are you busy in reading or writing?
Or are you busy in reciting poems?
This is wonder that technology tells,
Within fraction of second it connects,
Wherever you may be in far place,
I know you receive call of affection.
Go on writing your philosophical views,
You see life from deep within in truth,
Writing is perseverance, reading is too,
Observe sea and sky and forest carefully.
You go to seashore and see waves there,
Are you there near sea? Are you singing?
You are pure soul; God is like vast ocean,
Dear son, you connect him in lovely wave.
