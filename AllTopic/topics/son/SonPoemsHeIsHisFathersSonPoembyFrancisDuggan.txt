His father a decorated soldier a noble hearted one
And he the ballad singer sings of battles fought and won
A true chip of the the old block when all is said and done
He has his father's D N A and he is his father's son.
'Tis not to listen to war ballads that I have come in here
I came in for to quench my thirst with a cool frothy beer
He ends another war song to another loud encore
Yet why do they applaud him and beg him to sing more?
His songs fire the patriotism in them by keeping old wars alive
And ballads of old soldiers insure that wars survive
The songs he sing are very old and have been often sung
Of brave men who risked their lives in war and of brave men who died young.
He sings of young men who went to war that was the choice they made
These old men now who on war memorial day march in the big parade
With their bravery medals on display they won't leave old wars die
The war that was to end all wars another old war lie.
The son of a war hero of war he choose to sing
Though too much of patriotism is not a healthy thing
A true chip of the old block when all is said and done
He has his father's D N A and he is his father's son.
