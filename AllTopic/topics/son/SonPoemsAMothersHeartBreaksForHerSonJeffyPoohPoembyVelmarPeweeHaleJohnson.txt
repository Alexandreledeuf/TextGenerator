Though I only had you for a month, that time though short,
will remain in my heart, and mind for a lifetime.
You were so young, sweet, adorable.
You smiled, even up until the end.
I held you in my arms as you took your last breath,
tears rolling down my cheeks, and falling upon your tiny little body.
If only I could have done more than just holding you, and stroking your cheek,
and telling you we would meet again someday far into the future.
Mortality, what a cruel gift which can be taken away in the blink of an eye.
