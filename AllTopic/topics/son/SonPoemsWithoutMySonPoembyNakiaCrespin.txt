When I am alone, without my son,
I cry, I change, I am alone again, without anyone to love,
Love is the most valued posession,
Without my son I am nothing, but I am relieved,
Without my son,
I feel free to go and come as I please, nothing to hold me down,
Nothing to hold me back from anything in my day,
Because I am without my son,
My days return to being empty and pointless,
Because I am without my son,
The sun doesn't seem as bright and trees don't seem as green,
Without my son,
A pain in my chest is getting worse as I feel  as though I can't breath, skipping breathes, and now I can't catch my breathe,
Because I am without my son,
I can't sleep, then I sleep too much, I hardly eat my world is upside down,
Because I am without my son,
I am  dieing the slowest of deaths,
Because I am without my son.
