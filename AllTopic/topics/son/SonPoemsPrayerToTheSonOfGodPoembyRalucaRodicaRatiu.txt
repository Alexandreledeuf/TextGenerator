Just give the world Good Morning,
Wish for the sun to shine,
Don't give the wind the warning,
He knows that we are fine.
And give the helpless, hope,
And give the poorest, dreams,
Don't give the weakest, dope,
Don't give the frightened, screams.
Raise your hands upon ones,
Give them what they deserve,
Tell them that even guns,
Ruin the world we serve.
Don't shake the earth so hard,
Don't send us fire, burns,
You always put in guard,
To fear for what one earns.
And as you say Good Morning,
And make us all apply,
Your rules, and if we're mourning,
Never tell us Goodbye.
You know that Love is God,
You see us from above,
And you think that is odd,
We know... that God is Love.
