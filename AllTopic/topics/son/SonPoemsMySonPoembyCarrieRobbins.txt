My Son
My son 6 and 1/2 months in the womb
My son so small and cute
My son barely a child there
My son hooked up to so many things
My son is he going to make it
My son 3 pounds 2 ounces
My son is he going to make it
My son everyday with him
My son holding him and telling me that everything is going to alright
My son 2 years old now
My son took in from me by my parents
My son trying to get him back
My son everyday I'm from you I miss you
My son when I hear your voice I cry
My son when I hear you cry I wanna run over and hold you
My son I want you back so bad
My son I can't sleep at night not knowing if your alright
My son do you miss me and daddy
My son do you know that where gone
My son we will be together soon.
