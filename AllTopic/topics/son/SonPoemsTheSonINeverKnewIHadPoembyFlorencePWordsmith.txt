Walking down the street one day
I saw a little lad
The boy just danced right up to me
and said 'You are my dad! '
He showed me all of the results
of a paternity test
I'd always wanted a little boy
I felt like I was blessed
He lived with me a couple years
we grew to know each other well
but then the doctor called that day
our lives became a living Hell
'Johnny's kidney's failing'
said the doctor's quiet voice
'you'll have to find a donor'
and I knew I had no choice
I offered him my kidney
and the boy was very glad
we went into the surgery room
he said 'I love you, Dad.'
The operation went just fine
but when I did awake
my little boy was gone, yes he
was missing, no mistake
'Where's my boy! ' I cried aloud
the doctor looked depressed
'He just walked out.' the doctor said
'No need to get distressed.
The surgery went well indeed
it was really no bother
and his other kidney's doing just fine
'cause it's from his real father.'
'I'm his dad! ' I cried again
'This must be some mistake.'
'You're not his dad.' The doctor said.
'The test results were fake.
The boy was really mine, you see
but he was really ailing
I'd given him one kidney
but the other one was failing
We engineered this crazy scheme
so he could get another
now if you will excuse me,
we're going to see his mother.'
I watched him as he walked away
and hugged my boy outside
I didn't know what I should do,
so I just lay and cried.
And to this day I don't like kids
I like them not one bit
and that's why when you're gone next week
I cannot babysit.
