I look at you and see my eyes
looking through velvet skies
I wonder if you are bouncing through the same clouds as I
I haven't left this place
since i saw your mothers face
and now she forces me to ripen
to release the child I always knew
for the egg that beautifully grew
to become the father figure for you.
