He is the Joy a Son brings
sunny eyed;
whip smart
and kind.
A father
and a father alone
can know the pride
of the offspring
who grows
man hood tall
whose steady eye
and large tent heart
which could be fooled
by the devious
but not destroyed.
For  all that words may
not convey
Son let me say
how much you mean to me
and others
you have helped along the way
by being the you
that paused to give mouth to mouth
to an elderly stranger;
adopted sisters and younger brothers;
stayed close to your mother
never forgot your Dad
reached back
even when it hurt
built your life on solid earth
and to this day
celebrates life, undeterred
in your own unique way.
Job well done.
