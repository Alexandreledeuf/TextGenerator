if i had a son
i'll show him care
so as to have love
i'll give him money
so as to have more
id show him compassion
so that he'll be my companion
i'll teach him spanking
sothat he'll know his wrongs
i'll show him life
so that he'll learn to give
i'll show him the world
so he'll supress his greed
