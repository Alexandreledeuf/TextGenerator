Flailing nailed to tree of woe
Heartiest deed canst answer lo
Thunder claps atop fated trees
Impending havoc doth not sees
Betwixt ye cut the lancet clean
From the morrow not ye glean
Seeks dismal destiny fairest lock
Rudes loathe that sages mock
Tender feet hath burnt to hock
Crimson beads on braid an frock
Cringe ye that, hell hath send
Shapes the fate an olden bend
Tryst with Eden eagerly fought
Kings which to end hath sought
Wretched fate danced an got
Banshee wails, demons fraught.
Lore stealeth Adam's son.
Simple joys thatch hath done
Truth perishes as ocean raps
Sand grains most doomed to laps
Endless medleys hardly match
Eager that fire an fury snatch
Hear ye Dogs that yell in hell
Twixt, feisty demons fair to dwell
Lap blood off chopping blocks
Claw to bits the ascension rocks
Frenzied death to wistful morns
Contrive flames to fashioned forms.
Consumed reduced in deity's fold.
Vile the smiles that devils behold.
