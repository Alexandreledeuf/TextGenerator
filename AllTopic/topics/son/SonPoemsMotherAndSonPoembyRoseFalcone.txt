My son
I am here
I cannot protect you
From the world.
My son
I am here
I can only love you
No matter what
My son
I am here
My love unconditional
On this you can rely
My son
I am here
To guide and to teach you
And now you must fly
My son
I am here
Life can be difficult
I hear your cry
My son
I am here
Changes are painful
Never forget who you are
My son
I am here
Maintain the faith
In yourself and in God
My son
I am here
Self acceptance is yours
Do not fear
My son
I am here
