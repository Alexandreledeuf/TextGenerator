Time of the Son is close
It has always been close!
No one can stop the tide
Do you get what I say?
But, does it make it silly
Making the noise for peace
In speaking for those who can’t
Do I watch with folded arms
Concentrate on my rhymes
And on the chemistry of metals
Ignore what’s going on
The slaughter of the sheep
If not by the gun
By starvation, and by disease
The ones without guards to guard the body
This is a strange place in time
The strong kill for peace!
The weak remain on the run
The wise man is drowning in his bottle
The beast is wearing sheep’s skin
And I hate what I write…
