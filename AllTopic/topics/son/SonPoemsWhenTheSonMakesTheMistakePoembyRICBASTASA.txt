when the son makes his mistakes
the mother is always there to comfort him
and lessen the pain and tell her son
to continue what needs to be done
the mother tells him the world is so big
and wide and it will always understand
the world is so big and so wide that
there will always be a space for him
and from there the son understands what
love is: it starts from  a loving mother
and the son moves on to find a wife
whose love like that of his mother
must make him a real man since then.
