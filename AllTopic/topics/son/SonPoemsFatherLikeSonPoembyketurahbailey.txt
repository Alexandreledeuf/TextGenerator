I hope my little brother is nothing like you
Your a monster that feeds on innocent minds
Why are you so up tight
Let go of me thats all you hear
Little bro try to stay strong don't pick up that mans bad ways
I wish i could over come that man
He a beast a dog
Unbearable
Can't understand me
Let my brother be free of you and your bad ways
