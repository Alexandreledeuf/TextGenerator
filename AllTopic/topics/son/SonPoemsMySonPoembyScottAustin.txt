The day we met
It was sunny and bright
We drove for hours and hours
To the place where you were kept
You were but three
Such a wonderful sight
You were so tiny
You were full of get-up-and-go
You were so fast
You ran like a flash
It was hard
To keep in sight
You ran out that door
As quick as you could
You were yelling
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! ! !
As you ran down those stairs
You slipped and fill
I ran to you
To picked you up
From that grown
In which you were down
You had such a frown
I told you it would be ok
As I brushed you off
I kissed your knee
To ease the pain
You begin to cry
With those big brown eyes
All I could do
Was to hug you tight
As those tears continued run
I bounced you in my arms
To comfort you
As good father would
I sat us down
On those steps
To wipe the tears
That ran so clear
This was the day
When we first met
I knew just then
You were the son
That we could not have
I tell you this
You melted my heart
That much is true
For this could only mean one thing
For child as magnificent as you
It is only my love
That I could give to you
From that day forward
I knew it to be true
We would become
This new family of four
