The spring dawned after the biting chill,
Beams of sunlight filtered down,
Flakes of snow melted away,
And the whole world bathed in brilliant glow.
He came,
The dainty Darling of our dreams!
With promises full and hopes in store,
To fill the void,
within our souls.
To burst the silence,
with clatter of sounds.
To dispel the gloom,
that hovered on.
High from Heaven,
like a cherubim sent,
with the glow of umpteen candles lit,
He came,
To gladden our doleful hearts,
To deliver us of our blighted state.
He came,
Like the first rain on parched ground,
To drench the arid lands in splendid shower,
To ease the prick of sweltering heat,
And to put out the fire of growing drought.
Marvelling over the seizure of treasure,
Long hidden within the crevices dark,
We stood, so pleasantly taken aback,
Over the gift, ere vouched, but long delayed.
Like an eagle in its aerial route,
Flew my spirits in ecstatic rounds.
Like the Swallow, soaring high above,
My fancy took wings and set to fly.
He lay close to me, the bundle of joy!
His dark little eyes poised on my face,
Full with words on silent lips,
And wonder glistening his naive visage.
I peered into that cute little face,
The face I had long fondled in my dreams,
I whirled in the feel of prime feed,
And swam in the glory of maternal bliss!
