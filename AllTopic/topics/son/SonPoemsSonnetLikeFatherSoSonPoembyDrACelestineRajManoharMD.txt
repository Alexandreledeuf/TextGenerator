A father loves that son, who most obeys,
And maintains sense of values in his life,
And tends to parents when old, in last days,
With faith in God, unswerving, amidst strife.
A son loves father who is role-model,
And lives an exemplary life on earth,
Good-principled, undaunted, healthy, well,
And loves the son, whole-heartedly from birth.
With time, the son must equal father’s feats,
Surpassing him in fields where possible;
The father’s happy when son, glory meets,
And does great things which were impossible.
Like father, so will son then tend to be-
A truth the world will almost, always see.
