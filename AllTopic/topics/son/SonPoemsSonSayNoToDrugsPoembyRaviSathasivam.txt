You are born as a beautiful child.
Your parents had a dream to make you
a wonderful and worthy child
They did their best for you with
their struggle and pain.
Now they have pain in their heart to know
you are taking drugs
Their worries and pain in their heart you can not see
The tears on their face, you can not wipe
They have loved you and taken care on you.
Why should you take drugs
These are bad for you and kill you slowly
They make you crazy and lazy
Your cough will take your parents breath away
Your ruin health will kill your parents slowly
Not only you ruin your life but also your parents
Say no to drugs and save your life
Say no to drugs and take your parents worries away
Say no to drugs and save your nation's future
You have dream and make it come true
