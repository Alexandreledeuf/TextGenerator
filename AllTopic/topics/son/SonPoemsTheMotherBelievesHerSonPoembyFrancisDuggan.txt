He is serving three years for armed robbery but the mother says my son is not a crim
He is not the one who robbed the uptown drug store for someone else the cashier mistook him
My son has told me that he is not guilty and what he tells me I always believe
He is a kind, honest and loving person and does not use guns and is not known to deceive
The mother believes her son has been wrongfully imprisoned she says my son should not be serving time
My son was mistaken for a lookalike person he was not anywhere near the scene of the crime
Of course she believes what her son did tell her even though her son told her a blatant lie
And she will go on believing he has been wronged right up until the moment that she die
You will not find a love truer or greater than the love a mother has for her daughter or son
She stands by them through their trials and tribulations her offspring in her life are number one
A good mother will stick up for her children despite what others of them have to say
She will always be there for to support them when all others from them turn away
Her son has served a third of his three year sentence she visits him every second day
She says my son he is not even guilty for someone else's crime why should he pay?
