on august 26th in the year ninteen fifty three
god and my wife gave a son to me
a special son we knew from the start
and from that day on joy has filled my heart
our teachings about values, honesty and life
were installed but mostly by my wife
our son was a blessing
a gift from above
his special charm, thoughfulness
and especially his love
his efforts and determation
to obtain his goal
we watched with pride
as they did unfold
now as a man and a father himself
his wife and children
are more precious than wealth
so remember our son
as you open each new door
as much as we love you
GOD loves you more
