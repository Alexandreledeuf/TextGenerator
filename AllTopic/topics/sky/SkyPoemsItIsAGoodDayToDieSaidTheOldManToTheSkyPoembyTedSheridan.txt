The wind was kicking up from the Northwest
Storm clouds gathered to section off the Sun
Intense displays of furious pyrotechnics flashed brilliantly
From the mouth of the dark beyond
As Nature made its feelings known and I lay slowly dying
From a self inflicted stab at ending my family's drought
Having fallen on my sword as required in human sacrifice
My blood letting was to be washed clean and absorbed
Into the dry parched earth beneath my heavy soul
And the heavens would open up to receive me
For all which flows from them, so shall all be returned.....
