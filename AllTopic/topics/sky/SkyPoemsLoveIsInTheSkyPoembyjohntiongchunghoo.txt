sun is dad
spreads love and cheer
with each of his rays
children's laughter everywhere
moon is mom
watching over the earth
to make sure
we dont miss our way
in her varying ways
she cares for each and all
taking in all the pain
to make sure
all things are fine
earth, earth, earth is my lover
pulling me close all the time
giving me food and a perpetual shelter
even when i am mere skeletons and bones
