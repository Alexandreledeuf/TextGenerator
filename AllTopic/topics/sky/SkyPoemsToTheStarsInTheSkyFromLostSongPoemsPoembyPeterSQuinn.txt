To the stars in the sky
I must sing this song,
For they glitter and die
Both faintly and strong;
Like enchanting melody
That came to my ears,
With longings and memory
That no one ever hears.
I will sing of my wishes
To wherever they go,
What one hopes for and misses
When you love someone so;
Everything that I had
From the past until now,
What once made me so glad
Like a colorful rainbow.
To the stars that I see
On the dark heavens on,
That are faraway and free
Till the night sky is gone;
Like enchanting sweet song
That so softly will flow,
And you hear all day long
Like the past long ago.
