Alone
we dance
beside an endless ocean
its waters
the music that we dance to
the Heavens
an endless ocean of stars
our love
the music of the spheres
man & woman
woven into one
by the magic that we dance
we move
as one
beneath an enormous sky
a tiny speck
moving through time
the stars amazed
at how humans
not only make
but assume their own importance
and that they dare
to stop Time
with nothing but
a little scrap of love
grasped tightly
in their hands.
