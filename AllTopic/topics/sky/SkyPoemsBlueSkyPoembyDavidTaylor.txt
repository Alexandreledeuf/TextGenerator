Blue sky yesterday
Grey today
Did the blue sky
Go away?
What is blue
And sunny too?
The blue sky
Hiding behind the grey.
Grey today
But with blue sky
Waiting to come out
And play.
The sun is laughing
At my blueness
Blue sky with its greyness
Never meant for sadness.
Blue sky here today
But with a greyness
Covering all the blueness
This is what I want to say.
