Sky, blue sky
so blue and shy
u only appear
when there are clouds to dissapear
then comes the sun
so worm as the love of a mum
the sky full of light
iluminated by life
sometimes blue and and grey
how he should stay?
maybe always blue
maybe always gray
who knows
someday there will be no sky
to think how he shoul stay...
