Under the gleaming stars above
For we love live and laughter
sweet heart both you and I
your cheeks just two roses
you keep a happy smile
There a golden flowers shining all the while
With two lovely blue eyes and four golden hair
My heart keep singing as if our love be forever
Spring is here there is music in the air
You are love by all the world
Is smiled upon admired by all
Spring touch is every where
Beautiful shies gold and blue
The melody in your heart
And the love song be forever my darling
