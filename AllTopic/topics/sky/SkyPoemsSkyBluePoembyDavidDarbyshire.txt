My hair is light sky blue,
and my eye's are deep brown.
What does that say to you? ,
Please don't look at me and frown.
Well, my head is in the clouds,
my eye's, are focused on earth.
I do not wear any shrouds,
And my life is full of mirth.
When my head comes back to earth,
and my eye's look at the sky.
I wonder about my birth,
and ask a lot of questions, Why?
Why? ,  is not such a blur,
it's always the same answer.
We are all here to learn,
if not, you get another turn.
