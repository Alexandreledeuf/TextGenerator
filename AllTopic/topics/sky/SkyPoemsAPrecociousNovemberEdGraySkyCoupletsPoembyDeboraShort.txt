Sky a precocious November-ed
Gray, laced with threads of cadet blue
Dark billowed clouds angled half below
Majesty’s now, golden English Mountain
The rest billowing into the grayed heavens
Sheared weak thermal st ratifications
Yet, an extraordinary touchable
String to Trinity’s atmospheric heart
Chestnut’s Hills dressed warmly in fall hues
Adorn her feet in shades of gold and red
Cedars’ sweetly scented evergreen presence
Connects head and heart to everlasting life
Delicate laced limbs reach high above
Revealing the occasional straggler
Now, a striking golden contrast against
A promised wintering grayed sky
Black walnut trees' citrus-y scented globes
Drop and hide amongst the scattered crackling leaves
Mr. Gambol’s crepe myrtles now neon-ed, brilliant
Orange like Love’s light - filled radiant face
Steep yellowed hills all so freshly cut
Earth’s bounty carefully squirreled  away
Winters nourishment gathered with our
Most mortal hands while singing praise above
