Some activity with an addicting done,
Had to purposely afflict them to accept...
Misguided beliefs to condone and not shun,
To keep in their minds with such effectiveness.
To bring them to quickly re-act,
Without a thought process useless.
As if they had none.
'The sky is falling.
The sky is falling! '
~WHERE? WHERE? ~
'Over there.
Can't you see it? '
~I could 'if' I chose to.
But...
Do you mind me asking you this? ~
'NO! Go ahead.
What-what-WHAT?
Hurry up.'
~If the sky is falling over there.
WHY do you rush to get under it?
When the sky is perfectly clear right here? ~
'You?
You're one of those 'nonconformists' aren't you?
EVERYONE! EVERYONE!
Hear me now.
Hear me now.
The sky is falling.
The sky is falling!
We must run to get under it.
Come 'everyone. Come.'
Some activity with an addicting done,
Had to purposely guide them to accept...
Misguided beliefs to condone and not shun,
To keep in their minds with such effectiveness.
To bring them to quickly re-act,
Without a thought process intact...
To examine and enact with facts attached.
