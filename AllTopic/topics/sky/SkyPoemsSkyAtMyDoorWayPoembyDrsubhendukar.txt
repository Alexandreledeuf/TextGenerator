I look to the blue sky relaxing in silence
Its sun fed morning and evening showers
Peppered face of rain and summer
With its folded  breath in a horizon lamping
as if in deep forest, over  the dark and red scars.
as if spotless death and life caress each other
Extending its biting arms along all apprehensions
of pavements dwellers  being stuck here and there all around.
All those draped across are almost dead to the tunes
Of seas, mountain, meadows or of earth spun smiles
The tunes of conifers soliloquy stand intoxicated
In white caped wilderness of the Himalayas or somewhere
Or the galloping laughter on the beach in summer
Mutilated as if being caught in fishermanâ€™s net
Appears rasping on the dunes in ruthless alienation
Against the time and tide of travelers monologue
The silhouetted voices of returning birds emaciatedly eluded
As if to a peace procession of hungers before the temples gate
where i am stuck up glaring foggy eyes of dusky sky
At my door- way when the sky is hiding in darkness.
