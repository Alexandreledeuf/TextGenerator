Im not so sure he loves me...
Im not so sure i do...
but when im around him...
My heart tells me its true...
when im around this guy, i feel like i can fly...
so high i can touch the sky...
i get all nevous and i get all red...
i start to get a little light headed...
he talks to me...
its like a fantasy...
i dont know whats left in the world...
when he is not here to have me hold...
