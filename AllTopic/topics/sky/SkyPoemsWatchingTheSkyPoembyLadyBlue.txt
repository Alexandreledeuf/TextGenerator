I reach for the end of day
orange, pink, lavender, gray
and watch it slide out of my
fingers as the sun dips behind
the horizon for night to come.
The nights come with blacks and
grays, moon and stars and some
nights clouds draw the drapes to
the sky and I wonder what is up
there, invisible to my eye.
Sometimes I wait for mornings for
those colors to reappear and reach
for wonderful things the sun saw
while on the other side of the
world as I watched the night sky.
