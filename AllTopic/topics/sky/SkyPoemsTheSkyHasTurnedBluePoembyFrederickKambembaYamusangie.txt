Let us go out and celebrate
Let us dance, sing
And hug one other
The sky has turned blue…
It has brought with it
The spirits of happiness,
It has brought with it a positive energy
The energy to transform our mental vibration…
Let us go out and loose ourselves
Go and be possess by
The spirits of happiness
The sky has turned blue…
Maybe one could notice
One’s mental vibration
Being changed to a high level,
Regardless our five senses…
