Look up to the cloudy sky
I can see no stars tonight
Just the silver moon above there
Honey, please know that I really care
I wish I were there with you
You hug me n I kiss you
Look at the moon from our veranda
The Mars and the twinkle little six stars
I am longing to be with you
I miss you sweetheart, it's truely true
I always have you in my heart
I'm with you, you're with me, even we're apart
Good night to you my dearest darling
Wish you sing a beautiful song while I sleeping
Seeing you tonight in my sweet dreams
'Up to the stream' singing together as we're team
