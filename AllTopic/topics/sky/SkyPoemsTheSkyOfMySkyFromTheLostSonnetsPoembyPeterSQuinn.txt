The sky of my sky is the same as yours
And like the dreams of my dreams shall go on
We are the peace keepers and conquistadors
From our cells of the inside to each aeon
We will follow our dreams to clear the way
Aspire and wonder to the steps of the new
And the sunshine's the same wherever we stay
Whether it's cloudy outside or the sky blue
Much of our spirits have made the same thought
Brought us together or driven apart
Schools may differ of what we have been taught
But inside our breasts - beats all the same heart
Follow your dreams on and see them come clear
Give of your knowledge from what you have learned here
