A second bathroom was built.
The roof had such a tilt.
That a dormer had to be made,
with a window and a shade.
I crept out that upstairs window
To see why the night sky was aglow.
Sat there on that steep rooftop.
So I could look out over the treetops.
Off in the distance to the north
The Mardi Gras celebration on July the 4th.
I don't remember going there.
But I do remember the rooftop stares.
Knees bent from the pitch of the roof.
My own little opera booth.
From there I would view the bright night sky.
Colored mushrooms I would spy.
Wagon wheels and a pinwheel or two.
Even a shooting star to name a few.
Funny how you saw them light the sky
and yet the sound was almost denied.
Maybe just soft waves of mumble
as if a storm was starting to rumble.
I kept going back year after year.
To that spot I held so dear.
To witness the bright night sky
celebrating Mardi Gras 4th of July.
Until I married and moved away
We happened to be visiting that day.
Thought I would revisit some youthful joy.
Made it out that window, still bit of a tomboy.
But to my saddened eye.
I could no longer spy.
The bright night sky at all.
The trees now had grow too tall.
