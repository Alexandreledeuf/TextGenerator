Here I lie,
Staring at the sky.
Wishing I could sprout wings
And go there.
Just to fly
And pass the world by.
Moving on but
Going nowhere.
With my freedom
In my kingdom
Above all the stress
I can’t take.
Escape all the noise,
And all that annoys,
Run away from what
I can’t face.
In that serenity,
That’s where I’d love to be.
Floating on like in a dream.
And in that peace,
I think I could see
What living truly means.
In a crowd but all alone.
With all these problems I’ve always known.
I just want to get away
To somewhere.
To get away for a while,
And to find a true smile.
Then I could live with
What I cannot now bare.
I’ll return to Earth
And take on the worst.
Pretty sure I’d be
Just fine.
Head in the clouds,
Living without doubt.
That life is good and
Control is mine.
In that serenity,
That’s where I’d love to be.
Floating on like in a dream.
And in that peace,
I think I could see
Just what living truly means.
Now in serenity.
That’s where I love to be.
Floating on like in a dream.
I find my peace,
I think I begin to see
Just what living truly means.
And now I
Try to find
A free state of mind.
I tried
To find my place to hide.
No more, it’s time
For me to ride the sky.
Soon I come
Down back to home.
All around,
I feel good.
I felt the sun
When I had done
What everyone sometime should.
We find serenity.
Just where we love to be.
Floating on like in a dream.
And in that peace
We all can see
What living truly means.
In serenity,
Again I want to be.
Living life as a dream.
In my peace
I can finally see
What living free means…
“Wasting time
Like it was free…”
“I need serenity”…
