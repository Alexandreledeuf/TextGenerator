Three atoms of Oxygen,
That will make Ozone!
Which is in the Stratosphere,
The Shield’s almost gone.
Absorbing the U-V rays,
That comes from the Sun;
Ozone is so essential,
No more is this fun.
Ozone-holes are increasing,
Stop this if you’re wise;
Blame Man for its depletion,
Skin-Cancer’s on the rise.
Hundred chemicals almost,
Can de-ionize!
Fluro-carbons and Halons,
Mostly terrorize.
These are being widely used,
Phase them out, O Man;
They can cause Cataracts too,
Beware, Ye human.
They cause global-warming, so
Let the Ozone be;
Use those substances only
That’re Ozone- friendly.
September 16 th each year,
Is celebrated always;
As the World’s Day to preserve,
The OZONE LAYER.
