Black sails, against a midnight sky,
he buried his heart on an island.
Some day...
it won't matter when,
she'll open a green bottle and
find within, a scribbled map
that shows just where he
buried himself...in despair.
It'll read, from the oceans
edge first, two steps forward and
quench your thirst...for I am a river,
disguised as a stream...for I am life,
disguised as a dream... wake me,
my love, wake me, I'll give you
a sign, of where you can find
this heart of mine...buried deep,
and buried well...
and far enough away from
the oceans swell, that not just
any one, sailing by, would know
that it was I...
Black sails, against a midnight sky,
he buried his heart on an island.
He lay there buried, for what
seemed like years, the oceans edge
soon mixed with tears, and he waited
and waited, though she never came,
and the island no longer now
looks the same...
time has eroded both beach and sand
with no more trace upon the land
of where he buried his hope,
and dream, scribbled on a message
within a bottle of green.
Black sails, against a midnight sky,
he buried his heart on an island.
