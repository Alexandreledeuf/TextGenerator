My little nephew Kevin
is riding on the swing set
Muscling and thumping
the wooden saddle
Like a jockey in the derby
Arcing to equipoise while
Showing the bottoms
of his feet to the moon
Up and down
Back and forth
Suspended from above
Now almost a revolution!
And a free fall from
the forest canopy
Free falling to earth
Then free speeding to the crowns
of the trees again
He is silent in reverie...
until he shouts wow wee at the sky
Wow wee!
I am sitting under a pine tree
drinking coffee...
And shout wow wee at the sky
Wow wee!
