Though there are miles between us,
Though the days and the nights may seem long,
Look up to the stars and know,
That no matter where you are,
I'm there with you,
No matter where you go,
My love you'll have.
If ever you are lonely,
Or think you don't belong,
Look up to the stars and know,
That i'll be there with you,
So you won't be lonely,
When you think that you don't belong,
I'll be around to make sure you do.
Whenever we're apart,
Always remember,
Look up to the stars.
