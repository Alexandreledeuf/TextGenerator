Deep sky - deep deep!
What lies out there?
On earth I'll stay and sleep,
But to the sky I'll stare.
Some erudition to gain
From the swirling galaxy,
Perhaps I look in vain
Knowing not what to see?
The seeds of the years
That man has thought,
Going here and there's
What is after sought.
Searching not through
For life is full of growth,
Eternal springing youth:
Peace embellishing oath.
Ways are unpredictable -
Always new within new!
Some space dark and dull
With twinkling stars so few!
