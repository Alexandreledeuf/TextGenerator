As he is said nothing will be the same again
He would be proven to be right
One finds it difficult to appreciate what
Belongs to him or her
One should wonder why humankind
Not all of them off course
But enough to notice
Are failing to appreciate
The wonders brought
By the apparent rise of
The sun in the sky
And the light it brings with it
The rise in temperature allows
All of us to freely wander the streets
Especially when the sky turns blue
Thatâ€™s true
There would be no light or heat
As nice and wonderful as
The sunlight and the sun heat
Especially when the sky turns blue
