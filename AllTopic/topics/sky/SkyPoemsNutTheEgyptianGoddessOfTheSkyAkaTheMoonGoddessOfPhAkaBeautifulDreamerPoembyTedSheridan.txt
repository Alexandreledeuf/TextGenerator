The woman is a nut
She is an indehiscent hard-shelled
One-loculated
One-seeded fruit of a human being
Though she has multiple personality disorders
She is still just a nut
She is a nut in search of a machined screw
Something on which to thread herself
To become permanently affixed atop or bottom
As long as it is missionary and without sexual fervor
Locked in or welded by rust or chastity
Either a bolt or threaded rod will serve
This wing nuts need for bonding
The woman is a nut
A nut in search of a chocolate bar
Something to satisfy her cravings
And her stupendous need for love
She will demonstrate an illiterate
Propensity and strong cohesion
For her family unit
With names like Poe and Shakespeare
She salts my balls (vulgar slang for nuts)
Till my small brain and large bowel
Extricate themselves of this nut
Via a long walk in the park
And a short rest on a park bench
Where I am protected from this nut
By a rather large family of Squirrels
Named Bukowski
