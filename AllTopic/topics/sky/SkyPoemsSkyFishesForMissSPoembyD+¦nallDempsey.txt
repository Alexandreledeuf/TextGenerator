Fishes parade
across the sky
all shapes
all sizes
thinly disguised
as clouds
or
as you name them
“Cloudses! ”
Here a big old fish
enormous tail...enormous fin.
Here a seahorse
pretty & perky
chomping at the bit.
There the tiniest tiniest
little wispy fishes alive.
The sea itself
a sparkle of diamonds…diamonds.
Your hand
held in mine
your mind
& how you see this world
filling up my mind
our... footsteps... following us...in the sand.
