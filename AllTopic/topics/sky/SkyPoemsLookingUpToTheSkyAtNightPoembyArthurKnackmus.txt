Looking up to the sky at night,
Why are there no stars shining bright?
Many times I have looked up for any stars light,
Just to see total darkness and no stars that shine white.
Is this Gods way of telling us in heaven there is a fight?
Over something as simple as does might make right.
We just have to submit ourselves to God and hold on tight.
Because we humans are in a world with a hopeless plight.
By now you know I am quite right,
That sometimes there are no bright white lights at night.
Yes, some stars are a little red or yellow depending on their
energy, which is light.
From this you can tell I have good eye sight.
It`s not my intention to scare people into a fear or fright,
About this matter I have chosen to write.
No matter who we are, eventually we will go through a blight.
Even if you are King Arthur or a White Knight.
In this small town an angel could show the height of his flight.
Amazing you at night, going higher than a kite.
This world is just a play and West Salem is God`s chosen site.
Please pray that in Illinois every thing will be all right.
