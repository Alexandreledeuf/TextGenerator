O sky, my blue sky-
O earth my green earth!
The new light has
Filled me with mirth!
Trulalala, trulala, la, la, lala, la....
O sky, my dear sky,
O bird take me in the high.
I want to sing the song of life,
Along with the cloud wanna fly.
Trulalala, trulala, la, la, lala, la....
Clouds will be soon my horse,
I'll ride on its back, just see.
Air will dance around playing the,
music of merriment beside me!
Trulalala, trulala, la, lala, la.....
O sky, my pal sky-
Wish to throw all my pain.
Drip the ray of happiness,
In this world, shower the golden rain!
Trulalala, trulala, la, lala, la....
