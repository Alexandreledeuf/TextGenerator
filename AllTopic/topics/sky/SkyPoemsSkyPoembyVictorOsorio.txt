I opened a letter
But I couldn't read
Up in the sky
Down on the ground
I must pick my posion
Do I feel pain with every breath
Or do I live in the sky
After my death
Normal thoughts visit at times
Suicide ideas still exist
Day and night are always mine
Suicide tries are on my wrist
The sky is peaceful and blue
But also dark and blind
If I become a walking soul
My pain I will not find
Maybe, I could be wrong
Up in the sky
Down on the ground
I must pick my posion.
