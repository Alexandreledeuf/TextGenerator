I will give the sky to you
I will take the picture of the sky using a camera
That is the only way I can do it
If the sky was in the stores
Would they sell it?
No skies are in the stores
It is very high above us
We canâ€™t even reach
We could reach it only by plane
How high is the sky?
It is very high
All I know
The sky is blue
If the sky was pink would it be nice?
No it would be ugly
I guess I could have a pinky sky only in my dreams
To me would not make any difference
It is in my dream
No body else can see it
Just me
The sky will never be for sale
It is ours, it belongs above the earth
