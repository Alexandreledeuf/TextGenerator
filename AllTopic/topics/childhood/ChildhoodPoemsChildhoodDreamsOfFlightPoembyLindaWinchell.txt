When I was very little
I use to dream that I could fly.
I'd put some rubber bans around my shoes
leaped up and I was flying in the sky!
Flying over hill and dale
looking down on those I knew.
They would look up at me in wonder
all wondering how I flew.
I'm older now and don't seem to dream that way
was that only for that time?
How complex the human brain can be
all those thoughts trapped in our minds.
I dream today, that is for certain
but some I can't recall.
And then there are days, they all go away
before I awake I've lost them all.
Where do these dreams originate?
Are they coming from another place and time?
Or are they just the brains way of escaping
the daily stresses of my mind?
For now I'll just have to sleep and dream
dream what my mind has in store.
But I hope one day, Childhood dreams of flight
of jumping high in the sky to sore!
