Listen to their laughter
Listen to them sing
Watch them on the roundabout
Watch them on the swings
See them playing football
See them beam and glow
Innocence of childhood
Why does it not show…
Us … as we get older
How sweet life could be
If … just now and then
We could look and see …
The child … still deep within us
Gentle simplicity
That years and years obliterate
As we become less free
So caught up in the world
It’s complications too…
Wouldn’t it be nicer
If our childhood lasted through….
All our life upon this earth
It’s gentle innocence
Making mankind kinder………
And maybe have more sense…..
