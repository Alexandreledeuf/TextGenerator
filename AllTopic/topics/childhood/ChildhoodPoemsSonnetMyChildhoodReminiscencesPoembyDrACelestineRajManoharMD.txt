Can I forget my mother’s cooking skills,
Her punishments and kind advice at times?
Can I forget the games at school and drills,
My kindergarten teacher who taught rhymes?
Can I forget my siblings and my friends,
My father’s knowledge great that goaded me?
Can I forget my sins and my amends,
And how I asked God’s forgiveness dearly?
Can I forget the mosquitoes and ants,
That bit each one of us in yester-life?
Can I forget my hunger-pangs, half-pants,
My walks to school in rain and sun and strife?
My childhood years were filled with sadness, joys,
Innocent mistakes, tears and not much toys!
Dedicated to all today, on Mother Mary’s birthday
