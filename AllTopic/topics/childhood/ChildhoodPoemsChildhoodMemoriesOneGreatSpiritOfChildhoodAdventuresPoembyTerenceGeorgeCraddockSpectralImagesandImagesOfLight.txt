down the rabbit hole
of childhood memories
we tumble into lost world
watching Tobby Grandma’s dog
leap with incredible canine joy
baited by tumbling flowing water
of garden hose patterned fountains
my Father makes beside the path above
grass to entice Tobbies aerial antics
somersaults all viewing smile must
delight in, like magic, Tobby appears
across paddock with elfin liquid speed
always seeming to know when Father
waters the vegetable garden with sixth
dog sense following nose on summer
days yesteryear breezes leaps small boys
also into a myriad of adventures running
in fleeting moccasin grasses like an Indian
running playing chase in tall tree branches
with imaginative spirit that knew Great Spirit
despite an ocean of time and cultural difference
