I become stronger when I am in her presence
For even she knows that she is my quintessence
I watch her sleep trying to unveil her identity
As those pretty coloured eyes open to greet me
A smile forms on her beautiful face
Unsurprisingly sleep hasn't left it's trace
My lips met her lips to greet them to a new day
Eyes lingering on her wrists as I pull away
I can feel her heart beginning to race
As I see the aching pain on her innocent face
Fresh scars that I never knew exist
Have taken their place on her fragile wrist
Taking her hands in mine I kiss the scars on her wrist
Tears rolled from her eyes the moment I had kissed
I whisper in her ears that everything will be fine
Whilst wishing all of her pain becomes mine
Watching her suffer continues to tear me apart
Will her childhood memories ever depart
She cuts herself to ease the unbearable pain
No matter how hard she tries it's all in vain
My mind asks how long will this pain go on for?
Common sense tells me I can't take no more
Instinct reassures me that I will make it through
After all the advice I still donâ€™t know what to do
I wonder when the healing process will start
So that her past and present can drift apart
Will pain take mercy on her innocent soul
Or will it crush her wings causing her to fall
I wait for her pain to be washed away by the rain
So that she can forget her past to start all over again
