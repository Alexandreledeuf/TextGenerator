when u once lived here
life was so much different
life was fun and kewl
life was always an adventure for me & u
Taylor & I are always gonna be
childhood besties
we're frens till the end
I got your back, you got mine
till the end of our life time
your my ride or die gurl
my smile or cry gurl
your always my gurl
Taylor M. Boyd
I maybbe here, your lyke way over there
I will always call you
my childhood bestie
you & I have so much in common
wow....think of us as a mystery
we we're always together
never apart
until the day my bestie tay moved away
she left me all alone & sad
she didnt even come see me and say goodbye
she left me at a bad time
she left when I needed her so bad
I was sad, lonely, and depressed
for the longest time I will admit
taylor your lyke my lil sister
I will no matter what always envy you
you where there when I needed you
I was always there for you
and you broke my heart
when you left me behind
but no worries TAY...
I will always think of you
as my best
childhood BESTIE =)
