Among the things enriching,
That helped to shape my life,
Was the county fair
With fond memories in rife.
October of each year,
The fair would come to town.
The rides were fun, and the air cool—
With temperatures way down.
Hotdog, soda, candy apple—
There was much to eat.
But popcorn and cotton candy
Were my favorite treats.
Neon signs. Booming music.
Electrifying atmosphere.
Rides. Zoo. And exhibits.
Haunted houses—if you'd dare.
Ferris wheel for the sedentary.
Roller coaster for the brave.
Merry-go-round for the toddler.
The bumper car was raved.
A chance to win stuffed animals,
Dinnerware, and all else.
Just play the game, and hit it right;
Then choose the prize yourself.
The crowds were huge and excited,
Folks from everywhere.
‘Twas hard to find a parking space
At the county fair.
Life can be so much fun,
In spite of everything else.
So, take time to smell the roses,
And enjoy yourself.
