CHIPS OFF THE OLD BLOKE
This face(our face)    is
passed amongst us three...brothers.
Each of us wearing
it as our own. Only Dad
owning the original.
********
FIRST LOVE
My name scrawled in chalk
coloured with the confines
of a big red heart.
Your name now...entwined with mine.
Sunlight glints off our glasses.
********
AND THE FIRST SHALL BE LAST
Winning...the sack race!
Me out on my own...winning
by a smile...easy!
Take pity on poor struggling
No.2...ahhh...let him win!
********
L’ÉTRANGER
He re, everything is
foreign...strange...unknown to him
lost now as he...is
in the streets of his childhood.
Everything...as it was...no more.
Written all over my face.
********
DÓNALL’S TRAVELS
Here, his big bedroom
shrunk to tiny box room.
His lake...a mere pond.
He now a giant among things
in the lost land of his childhood.
