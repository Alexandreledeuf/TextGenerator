I find myself praying to Jesus
When once again
I’m lost in an unsympathetic city
Feeling lovelorn and alone
Or utterly disgusted with myself
For some abandonment or abuse
Of a fragile and beautiful friend.
Certain days are drunk in the daylight,
Certain attitudes are vile and disgraceful,
Certain failures in matters of faithfulness
Destroy the soul.
I’m walking by a park where I played
When I had an innocent heart.
Drifting back to a happier time,
I’ve got tears in both my eyes
And I’m praying to the Jesus of my childhood
