My childhood was fun,
tough and exciting.
My childhood was one
where there wasn't much fighting.
This was my childhood.
My childhood was filled
with family and friends.
My childhood was filled
with love that tied up loose ends.
This was my childhood.
My childhood came
with a grandmother that cared.
When she left me
I remembered all the times we shared.
This was my childhood.
My childhood was filled
with classwork and homework.
My childhood was filled
with parents who hated work.
This was my childhood.
My childhood was filled
with fun in the hood,
and food that tasted like Campbell's,
'Umm Umm Good! '
This was my childhood.
My childhood was filled
with tricycles and bicycles.
My childhood was filled
with popsicles and Dill pickles.
This was my childhood.
My childhood was filled
with lots of happy holidays.
Holidays that aren't
just the same nowadays.
This was my childhood.
Now my childhood
has become nothing but memories,
But all the good times
will live on within me.
This was my childhood.
