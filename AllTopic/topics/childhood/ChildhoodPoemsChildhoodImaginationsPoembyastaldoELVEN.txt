In a land far far away
Lived pixies
and elves
and fairies
and goblins
A fantasy which I had fallen in love with.
In a deep dark cave
Lived a huge, dangerous
Monster
That was loud and ferocious
And that was an example of
What scared little children like me.
In the mysterious blue sea
Lived a beautiful mermaid
She was so pretty
That whoever set sight on her
Was mesmerized
How I wished to have had her beauty.
In an eerie, weird forest
Hid a sly, wicked witch
Who casts evil spells
Who abducts naughty children
And locks them up in a cell.
How frightening it was!
In the bizarre outer space...
