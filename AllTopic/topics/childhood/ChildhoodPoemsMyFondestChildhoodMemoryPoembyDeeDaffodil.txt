Homework, said my teacher,
Is to write a poem,
About your fondest
Childhood memory
Immediately, I began to shake
And within minutes
A cold sweat had
Come over me
I had dreaded,
Absolutely dreaded,
This day,
This moment in time.
I thought perhaps
I might find an excuse
Such as dogs dying
Or broken water pipes
I wondered
If I dropped the course
Would I get
A rebate?
And then
It dawned on me
The perfect line...
I'm afraid
I've had amnesia
All these years.
