And as we grew older
Childhood became so distant
We were too busy being
great, being brilliant
That we stopped seeing
But were we ever young and crazy
What were our teenage years
But the yearn to be older
To be established, free from fears
We just kept getting colder
Youth is not a matter of age
But a state of mind
Fully live each day
or soon you'll find
You can't honestly say
'It's not yet too late'
