my childhood was the time when i was innocent
when the world seemed to be fair
when my universe was around my toys
my childhood was the time when 9i lived in dreams
when everyone was selfless
when everyone appeared to be a friend
my childhood was the time when my life was full of colours
when sorrows never knocked my door
when smile was gift presented to everyone
my childhood was the time when love was pure
when there were no obligations
when tenderness prevailed
my childhood was the time which is long gone
tears flow from my eyes when i go back in my childhood
my childhood will never come back but
the child in me will never go
