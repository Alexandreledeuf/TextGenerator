A COUPLET OF PABLO NERUDA HAD INSPIRED ME TO COMPOSE THIS POEM. COMPOSED ON 8TH OCTOBER 1980.
**************************************** *************************************
Oh beauty! Thy face is
Slumber and pale so deep
In the smalt of night,
In this silent hour.
Oh dreams! Thy rainbow feathers
I saw in my bed
Void of that golden hue
That once my years filled.
Oh song! So echoing thy strings-
Was so enchanting once.
Now with tears engrave on thy grave
An ode in this silhouette.
Oh sweet days! Why now weep
Fondling in silence with candid feelings?
That quiet little brook whispers unto me
Of our childhood avenues so sacred.
Oh my soul! Thou from the distant past
Bring me a faint whiff of my childhood.
You were my first delight, you gifted me
Umpteen poems to light my solemn hours.
