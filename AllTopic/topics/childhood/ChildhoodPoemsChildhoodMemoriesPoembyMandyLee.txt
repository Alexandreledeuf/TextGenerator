Rays of light flow through the glass,
Flittering memories of the past.
Of happy times and playful things,
like a baby bird spreading its wings.
Flying through the sunlit air,
without worries without cares.
Its simple nature so soft and calm,
Beckons everyone like a charm.
A little fox running through the trees,
fields of flowers and their bees.
So close to heart and yet so far,
A child's life is like a shining star.
