'lie still, and be forevermore a child'  Christopher Dowson
Your remote beauty is impressive
but not lovely.
I fear, the sudden aloof awareness
of these barren heights to which
no longer child you foolishly aspire -
and ruthlessly descend -
self banished from your elfin realm;
In which you dwelt and frolicked.
