An open space, pitted with ditches,
Jagged places, filled with debris.
We were warned not to play there
But what child could resist it?
There we built palaces
From which princesses were rescued;
Plains where cowboys fought indians.
Among the ruins we played hide and seek,
Cops and robbers, kick the can,
And other childhood  games.
In summer we climbed mountains,
Explored new continents,
Hacked our way through jungles.
In winter we sledged on icy slopes,
Had vicious snowball battles.
And when it rained we made paper boats
That sailed a brief moment,
Then sank in muddy puddles.
