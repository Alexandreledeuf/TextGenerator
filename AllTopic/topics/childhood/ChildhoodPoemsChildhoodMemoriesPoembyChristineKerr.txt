Back when I was a kid at play,
we played  games throughout the day,
Telephone wires that snapped on the ground,
were our skipping ropes we had found.
Stilts were made from wood poles so grand,
Walked my brother from a roof tops  across the land.
Back yard swamps were cleared during autumn rush,
Which made winter skating go from Dawn to Dusk.
An important  roll my big brother did play,
Tying a rope around me,  on hot swimming days,
Someone would ask,  'What good will that do.'
-'Just pull me up,  if I  should turn blue.'
Needing some money,  we walked the ditch,
looking for pop bottles to make our pitch.
Our crew hiked to town,  It was our only way,
To see a good movie on a free Saturday.
Now the woods was a place of wonder
Rocking ourselves from one pine tree  to another.
Forts were built,  and hide and seek  played.
From the house,  the cars horn blew by end of day.
Oh how  I miss the days as a kid
When your imagination ran wild through your head
Friendships held strong,  throughout the years
The trust has remained,  as we laugh with tears.
