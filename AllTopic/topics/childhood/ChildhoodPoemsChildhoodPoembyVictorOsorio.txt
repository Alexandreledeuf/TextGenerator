I miss my old home
It had a broken mirror
I couldn't see my face
I miss my childhood
It had a broken memory
It was a lonely place
But it felt comforting
We have one childhood
Whether it's good or bad
We remember those days
and all the fun we had
But it could also be ugly
The way it was for me
I was picked on alot
They made fun of me
Now I'm getting older
But, I'm still a child
This world gets colder
For each and every child.
