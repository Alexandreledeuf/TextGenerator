Rummaging our way,
Through the school backyard,
Borrowing chalks, the ball, and
The bun from Mrs.Cook...
(But we ain't asking permission)
I never felt sorry...
Because she was with me...
Jumping over the stone fence
Into Old Mr.Grumpy's orchard...
Stealing oranges and hurling grapes at him...
When he chases us around....the shivering creature...
I never felt any pity...
When she was near me....
Sticking out our tongues at minors...
Grabbing lollipops off their hands...
Handing them a candy,
We smirk round the corner...
(A wrap around a stone...Hehe)
I never felt culpable...
Indeed, she was with me...
Blaming each other when caught...
So elders might confuse...
Hiding their keys,
For a day and a night....
I never felt guilty,
When she was with me....
