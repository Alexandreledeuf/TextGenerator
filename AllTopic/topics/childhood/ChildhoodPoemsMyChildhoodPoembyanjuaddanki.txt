My mother tells me about it,
And I also remember a bit,
The time when I was too innocent,
The time which was superb and excellent.
I used to play with my toys,
And my life filled with happiness and joy,
Life was then exciting and alluring,
But now, it is becoming boring,
I cant't forget those days of mine,
In darkness of my life, like the jewels, they all shine,
By chance, due to good deeds of mine,
If God will ask me for my wish at any time,
I will wish to become smart and good,
But my first preference will be my Childhood.
