Most of us had childhood books
The meant so much to us long ago
We can remember the story if not the words
It seems we cannot let it go
That’s the way I feel about my favorite
Called Poppy the Four Inch Fairy
I’ve looked and looked on the internet
I’ve sent out so many queries
But nothing, my friend, have I gotten
For feedback of my favorite book
Little Poppy is lost forever
She is nowhere that I look
So I guess she will live only in my memory
I can picture her with her light brown curls
Investigating a dollhouse because
Into the world of giants she was hurled
I’ll bet you have special memories too
Of childhood books from long ago
That will stay in your mind forever
And you too cannot let them go!
