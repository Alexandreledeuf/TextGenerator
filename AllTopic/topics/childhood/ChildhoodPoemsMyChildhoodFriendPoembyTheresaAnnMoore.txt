We were little girls
Living next door to one another
I was an only child
She had three younger brothers
We became close friends
We pedaled together on a bike ride
We liked singing with songs on the radio
We did our homework side by side
Skillfully we climbed an old fruit tree
And sat on branches with legs dangling
We’d snatch apples and eat them green…
Our throats were gripped by tart strangling
We were actresses without a written script
What a story our young minds could weave…
When our imaginations convincingly took over
the roles we played truly made us believe
Many years have passed since we kept company
We both grew older and went our separate ways
Only today... I thought back to that carefree time
I wonder now, if she ever thinks of those days
