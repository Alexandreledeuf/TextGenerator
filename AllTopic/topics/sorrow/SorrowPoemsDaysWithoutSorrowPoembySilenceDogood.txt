Teardrops fall down my face.
The mistakes I cant replace.
The days I forgot,
The memories I lost.
And all because I was killed inside.
Poisoned by youre secrets like cyanide.
I lost myself forgot my friends.
Headed towards the dark end.
And I try but the harder I try,
the more I fail the more I lie.
And I have to beilive than I can go on.
Even when everything has turned out wrong.
I have to keep going in the hopes of tommorow.
Waiting for the day without any sorrow.
