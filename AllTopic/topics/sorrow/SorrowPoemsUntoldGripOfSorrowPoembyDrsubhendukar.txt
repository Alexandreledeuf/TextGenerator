skin seems roasted by scorching rays
sky is burning by heat of summer
sultry weather remembers autumnâ€™s flow
anger never reels through by fear of love.
softness mellows by sweet feeling
where is smile latching on into hide?
oh emotion be cup of anger retreating
silence miffed yet untold by grip of sorrow
night still seems resilient by tear as dew
heart loses its rhythm riling upon wisdom
abstruse stillness redeems from penitence
as the reality insists upon truth of reason
Sorrow redounds deep in darkness in furrows
Humor blurs in dearth of rippling smiles
Sadness rides over the glow of ingenuity
Do you ever measure the distance of love?
