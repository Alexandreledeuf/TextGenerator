Still I can hear your deep sob
Echoing in my heart
Pricking my conscience
I don't know what to say
We all grieve on your fate
But never raised a finger
I can see you stretched on a dingy cot
Your house dilapidated
Your hair undone spreading
Your tears dry
I see your bare neck
Still bearing red with finger prints
Your lips dry with fear
Oh mother your eye lashes wide with fear
Your deep blue eyes move round and round
The nightmare you had had multiple
The pain of life written all over your face
I can imagine all what you have gone through
Your children weep pulling yr skirt
Your torn skirt
Your body smelling sweat and saliva
Of those soldiers
Your breasts bear the stench of their beret
Your veil was hung on the wall stained in blood
Shaming the humanity
I see your children sucking from your dried breasts
Crying for little milk
Poor things they never had a decent meal for a long long time
Oh poor babies
We hear they cry waking you up
But you are tired
In fatigue
Oh my mother now they are bargaining your flesh
The shopkeepers and the Yankees
They want to trade your flesh
Your pride
Your chastity Your righteousness
Your dignity
Oh mother I weep for you
Let my tears mingle with blood flowing
_ in Euphretis and Tigris
I cry louder and louder
Until someone hears……
