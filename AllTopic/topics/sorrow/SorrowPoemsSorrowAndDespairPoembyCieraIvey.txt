The pain crashes to the depth of my soul
Just another feeling of sorrow
Another flinch from pain
Just like yesterday, it'll be there tomorrow
Wounds healing slowly
So slow, it seems not at all
I want it gone tonight
But still and fast I fall
Where does it go from here?
Does it end?
Will it continue?
When did it begin?
But you don't care, do you?
I don't know why I even bother
You will never be what I need
Why should you try now to be the father?
Are you done hurting me?
Are you finished yet?
You enjoy it, don't you?
You have not one regret.
You took away my pride,
My joy, and my brother.
You avoided talking of things I needed to hear
Such as my mother
I just needed you
The love of a father
But I don't want it anymore because
I was never your daughter.
