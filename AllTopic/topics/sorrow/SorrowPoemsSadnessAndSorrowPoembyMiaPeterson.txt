Its just a small story
And I feel the need to say it
I just couldn't take it anymore
The pain he was causing me
It was just too much for me to bare
It was only that night
Which I realized that I had to do it
I gave you a text message
Apologizing, but in the same time
Telling you that I had to be strong
And forget you
It was over
I never worried about my past or future
And you were my past
That was the only thing
Which was clear to me
Suddenly you call me
Asking for an explanation
I told you it was too much for me to put up with
You did your best to apologize
But it was all in vain
There was no time for another try
Although a big future was awaiting the both of us
You still tried to apologize
But I was too stubborn to try once more
All I did was close my phone
And go to bed
Hoping that till tomorrow I would have forgotten you
I feel asleep very fast
Because all the tears I cried had finally made their effect
The next morning I woke up happily
As I turned my phone on I was ready to call you
But then I just froze there
Doing absolutely nothing
Remembering I could no longer be with you
I went to our special place
Next to the pink lake
Under our blossom tree
But I saw someone was already there
It was you
I started quivering
You turn around to me and fake a smile
But even his fake smile soon faded away
Apologizing once more
With little hope in your heart
A tear runs down my face
And I run to you
You open your arms widely
Patiently waiting for me
To throw myself in them
It was exactly what I did
You tell me you're never going to do any mistake
Never again in your life
I tell you that I just can't live without you
It was that night
I realized how much I love you
How much I care for you
How I'm addicted to you
You're like a drug for me
And I'll never check in a rehab
With such a satisfactory drug
Like the one which is on my mind right now
That drug is you
Now we just go on with our lives
Being there for each other
With no fake smiles
With no secrets
Only with a flame in both our hearts
A flame which will burn forever
