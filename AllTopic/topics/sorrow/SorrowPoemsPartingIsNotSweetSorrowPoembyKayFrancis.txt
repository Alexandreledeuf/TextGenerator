Loathing tomorrow,
Your expected departure
Cuts me to the quick
Survival is uncertain
Without you to protect my heart
I've both loved and hated you
For being my source
Of pleasure and pain
But I never wanted
To be without you
Not for an instant
Our life together is over
And painful as the thought may be
I know our parting
Is for the best
What more can I say except
Good-bye my lovely
Lily-white breast
