I pass the weeping willow,
wondering for whom it cries.
Could it be for all God’s children
falling like stars in the sky?
I hear the sound of blowing wind,
wondering for whom it moans.
Could it be for all God’s children
who must wander with no home?
I hear the sound of the lonely wolf,
wondering for whom it howls.
Could it be for all God’s children
who must sleep with empty bowels?
I hear the sound of the church bells,
wondering for whom they toll.
Perhaps they toll to remind all God’s children
to do the good deeds they were told.
