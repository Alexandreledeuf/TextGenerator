and leaving behind the tity bed of
new sand with the moon casting its
lonely shadow, it told me then, the
sand is new, and now is the time
for a new start in my life leaving behind
the battered hinges on the door to my
forsaken heart, but letting the oppourtunity
to replace its barren walls of sorrow......
