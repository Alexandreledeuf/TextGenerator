I still remember the soft touch of your hand,
As I stand here lonely in this foreign land.
And can you remember how I loved you?
Does love still glow in those eyes of blue?
Sing me that song those birds sang long ago.
Hold me close in those arms and never let me go.
Don't say you are leaving as you have done before.
Say we will be together today and forevermore....
Let's walk together and talk of what has been done,
And then go for a swim in the bright sun.
As I get the feeling the time is drawing near,
I will hug you to me and cry a sorrowed tear.
The memories were special, for now they are gone,
But I still recall each one with every rising dawn.
One last goodbye, parting forevermore.
One last kiss, more feverish than before.
I cherish our  love,
It's tender, sweet song.
And hope in my heart,
This parting won't be long.
