What of life as the sun rises away from the cloud of doom.
Is there a place that is without doom and gloom.
Is there a far distant land where life is full of fun, and is there a
land where life does not have to look down the barral of a gun,
Torment and sorrow as far as we can see but life could be so
different if everyone was free
Free from hunger, free from pain, but there is never a break
it always remains the same. Sex abused kids and the
want for food, what is the meaning of this modern brood.
Can we change this perfectic world and find a life without sadness
and sorrow, can it happen now or do we wait until tomorrow.
Tomorrow never comes as everyone knows, but the pain and sorrow
just grows and grows.
There is a chance that the world could live as one,
but not while we are looking down the barrel of a gun.
Every country has it's own rule, but it's the people that live there are
made to look the fool.
