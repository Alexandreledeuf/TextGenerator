When i dream i dream of sorrow,
My dreams are long and dark,
I can hear the sond but never see the color,
My dreams leave me awake some nights thinking,
Some dreams are more of a story,
But all have sarrow and pure sadness,
The trees are dead im the last alive,
All my dreams end the same,
A rock and a bang,
The rock is the earth,
More sorrow then the night before,
My dreams are deep and make me wright things like this,
The more i dream the more i cry,
The more i cry the more i think about my own death,
Will a die at 90 of age or 15 from a gun,
Will the killing ever stop,
Will we ever know how the world ends,
My dreams paint a dark and stormy picture,
My poems paint a clear,
My mind crys of dark things like this,
My hart crys harder and harder,
Between sweet and sour,
I think the end will end sour,
Are we to end in fire or ice,
You chose i would rather end in ice,
