If we love a thing, a flower, Nature or a person, it is
Indeed a natural feeling of heart that settles in mind;
If we lose a thing, we get another thing in its place;
If we lose a flower, we get another one, but not a person!
Nature is eternal, but all others appear and disappear;
But humans with heart and mind it is difficult to lose
The loved ones that cannot be regained in the world...;
Grown ups may manage themselves, but what about a child?
The child remembers the loved ones deeply in heart ever;
The child may forget by diversion on so many new things;
The child may grow up, but never forgets the loved ones;
How can the child bear, if loved ones pass away regularly?
The longing of child grows bringing in the sorrow of life;
Like the darkness slowly occupies in full the whole place,
Sorrow engulfs the heart of joyful child, if all loved ones
Pass away one after the other in the journey of life here!
This kind of sorrow how can the child bear and manage ever
Is a big question heartens me much, when I recollect the
Deep love of a child on me after the demise of my better-
Half sometime back in my life never leaving my mind sure!
