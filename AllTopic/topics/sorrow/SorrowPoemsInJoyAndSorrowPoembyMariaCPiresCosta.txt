What glorious times she has lived!
Bright days of enthusiasm for her activity
Surrounded by lots of friends and a happy family!
Now treasuring plenty of gifts received...
Clouds of gloom have come to fill the air...
For family love and joy of life
She keeps struggling without a strife
Always facing it without despair!
