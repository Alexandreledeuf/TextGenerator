My soul is cold as ice.
My heart is darker then the void.
Nothing seems nice.
All happiness devoid.
I feel nothing.
Except that of pain.
I've looked for that one something.
But I just ended up crying in the rain.
My tears are dry.
They could fill the deepest oceans.
The end seems nigh.
There is only pain, no other emotions.
My hope, my life...shattered.
I cannot pick up the pieces.
It's not like I mattered.
But my sorrow increases.
I have been mocked, betrayed, and destroyed.
No medication can numb my hurt.
All those around me seem overjoyed.
When my face is shoved into the dirt.
My God has left me.
Sitting up in his throne.
I did not want to be his enemy.
I'll just sit here and moan.
My love has thrown me aside.
Like damaged goods.
I wish I just would have died.
In a grave unmarked in the deepest of woods.
And so here I am.
I am not sure if I will be alive tomorrow.
I just don't give a damn.
I am going to drown in my sorrow.
