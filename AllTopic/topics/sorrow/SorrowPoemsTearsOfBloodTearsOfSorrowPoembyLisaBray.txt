Time flys leaving you.standing in the middle of the floor.
when you realize he's gone you fall  hopping he will return.
(a Tear falls to the floor)    and glass breaks.
Blood begins to shed when you gave up your life you gave up him.Time he realizes your gone he falls  to the floor hopping its not true.
That she would come back to you.(a tear falls)    and you pick up your gun.
A shot is Fired.
when u gave up your life for the girl you loved....
you got her back now you and her will forever stand with each other with out a end.
love lisa bray!
