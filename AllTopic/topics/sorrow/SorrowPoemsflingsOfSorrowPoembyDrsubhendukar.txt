yet I do remember the hoary stance of night
rolling spumes away into onshore
to heap of sands yet not unknown
history yet records reels of fire.
where are those tiding whelms from hide
speckles ocean pierce into air unfailing
whispering dew of roses basking in glow
moon seemingly snored in valley of obscurity
mystery may uncover the flings of sorrow
night when chilled being chiseled of snow
do we ever know the eternity by reality?
rainbow is ephemeral by voyage to void
