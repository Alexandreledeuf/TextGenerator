I smile as the blood runs down my arm.
The blood is a mixture of mine and those who have,
betrayed my trust and heart.
I don't care if i die for my crimes,
to me it was all worth it in the end.
Now i know that no one will betray me again,
but if they do i will kill myself instead of them.
Maybe, just maybe, I'll rest in peace with no fear of
ever getting hurt again, but I know that's not true,
you never get peace.
There is no such thing in any life time.So now i know
why i'm here...
I'm one of those few poeple born into this world,
that are priveleged to be hurt, stabbed in the back,
betrayed, and most of all...unloved.
That day I ran out of tears, so now I smile.
I truly have no reason to.
But since my tears are forever dry.
I smile for its the only thing i can do.
