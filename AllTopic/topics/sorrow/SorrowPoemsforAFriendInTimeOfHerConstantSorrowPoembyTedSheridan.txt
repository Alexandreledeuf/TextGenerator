My dear friend, but for clouds in your eyes;
The sun failed to rise. But rise it did today,
Just as it always has and always will.
The sunshine and light you seek is not to be found
Even on the fairest of days, but rather it can be found
In the heart, where your Joy has retreated for protection
For a safe haven given its constant overexposure.
You give joy with every kind act you perform, and
With every smile you so freely provide to all,
Yet the one thing you are missing in your life
Is a true love of your very own. You search for this love
In the morning sun, when perhaps the lover you seek
Can be found standing in an evening rain,
His eyes beaming with the love he brings…
