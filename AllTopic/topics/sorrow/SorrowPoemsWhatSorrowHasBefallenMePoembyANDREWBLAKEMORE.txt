What sorrow has befallen me
No sun to light my day,
These clouds yield only misery
While joy has fled away,
Across the lands where no one goes
And all do fear to tread,
Where only fear and silence grows
And dreams are lying dead.
Now waves of sadness and despair
Do swamp my aching heart,
For no one now does seem to care
My life's been torn apart,
Regrets I shall take to my grave
My tears forever flow,
For all my hopes I could not save
And on the winds did blow.
And yet no malice do I keep
Nor hate towards my love,
I'll dream of her within my sleep
While stars do shine above,
And hope that soon the dawn shall break
Then shine just like before,
For now I know each morn I wake
I'll miss her even more.
