Challenges in life, The ups and downs,
It’s all part of life, both smiles and frowns,
Like a Ferris wheel, you’re up then down.
You wish to hide, or maybe leave town,
Reality is real; we all face the fear,
We smile with joy; we all shed a tear,
Life can be lonely, when no one is near,
We often think, we’re not welcome here.
The sorrow we feel, that others can’t see,
A desire for help, we wish to plea,
A sense of loneliness, A desire to flee,
You’re not alone, both you and me,
Friends are waiting, with the comfort we need,
They are waiting; their hearts also bleed,
One small gesture, just one small seed,
Is all that’s required, for a friend to proceed,
To listen and comfort, for someone like you,
They want to help. They have been there too,
We’re not by ourselves, when life is so blue,
Someone can help, with the pain we go  through,
