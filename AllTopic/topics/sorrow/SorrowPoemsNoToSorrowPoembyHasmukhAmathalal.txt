Can little sweetness be added to sorrow?
Can sadness be not pushed aside for tomorrow?
When both are interwoven to each other
Why to think of them more and bother?
Pure or true love can never deceive
Warmth and feelings we always receive
Best ideas emanate from within and peace be conceived
Does that speak of real intention as goal is perceived?
Let love speak and not remain or confine within
Eyes must reveal and nothing should remain in
It is very much essential and must prevail at last
Acceptance should be made known very fast
I must acknowledge it as God sent gift
Why to have in life more tussles and rift?
We should never change stand and shift
Switch over from one to another should be very swift
I am prepared to forgo prestige and pride
Why in love it should be sought and hide?
Simple admission of true feelings and no guilt
Trust the opinion and strong foundation to be built
I shall seek no favor in return
Let my love grow and cause no concern
Earnest desire must be explained in turn
Let there be real union without any heart burn
May be in my life today is the happiest day
I will continue to seek and have my way
Let her remain true to her conscience and say
Never will we be separated, come what may!
Things may prove difficult if it turns out differently
Both have to think it honestly and approach separately
Time may run out us and not allow us to unite
Passion may remain passion only and within ignite
We may take steps to see that it doesnâ€™t turn ugly
It may be too early also to forecast it so early
Still it will remain our top priority to tackle the issue
We must get in turn what ever is destined to be due
We will not be cowed down with by unexpected events
We will face it bravely when it is made known very next moment
We will not allow it to happen and take us completely by surprise
But all possibilities are definitely there and bound to arise
We shall from now on shed no tears and face the reality
We shall stand firm and come up bravely for any eventuality
It has to be faced with as if dealing with any of the disaster
We must carve out the way and destiny as done by master
