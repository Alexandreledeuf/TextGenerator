When sunsets for night sorrow drifts in, whispering through the trees.
Her gown flutters through the air  as she glides over me.
Setting quietness throughout the land,
In a dangerious whisper that gave me shivers.
The despair settled over me, as her calming deadly wrath,
Wrapped me in a blanket of sadness.
