Oh  Solitude!
Ah grief!
Thou twin tormentors
That   keep so close
To the heart
Even the marrow of the bone!
I wish thee farewell
And that thou wouldest flee, to the
Farthest  regions of Hades,
And stay far away
And not come near
To hold me dread
in  thy grasp  so  strong;
So that I  can be free
To  love and to live again!
