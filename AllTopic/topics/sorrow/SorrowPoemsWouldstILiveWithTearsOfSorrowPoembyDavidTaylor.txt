Wouldst I live with tears of sorrow
fearful of what will come the morrow,
yearning for past times of glee
thinking back on thee.
Wouldst I live with sadness borrowed
from the losses of life's furrows,
walking forward in the past
lamenting what has gone so fast.
Wouldst I live for a rosy future
one that promises another way
that will make a brighter day,
and all the while I am right here
living in a state of fear.
Leaving past to memories locker
and the future not yet formed
I will not; cannot follow.
All that holds the gift of life
is present now and free from strife,
in this moment full of potential
is the answer existential.
Giving light and holding faith
never lacking; full of grace.
Looking back I loose my self
when all that's needed is belief
that this ever present moment
frees me from all the causes of my grief.
