joy and sorrow resolute within and beyond
night seems to lie in deep sleep
speckles of darkness covers her body
i close my eyes by the bliss of love
tonight tolls cry of innocence
as we look back through lone silence
audacity of hope resigns to repose
rain was running in deep breath
earth clenches mirth into riff of dusts
thirst dissolute melting the shadow
would you not comeback to fold of tonight
moments still remembers tinge of snow
