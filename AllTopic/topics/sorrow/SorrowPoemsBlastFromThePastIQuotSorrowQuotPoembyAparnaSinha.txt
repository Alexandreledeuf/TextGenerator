Tears that are in my eyes
are not-Sorrow of barren Land
Where life barely exists
And sound of rain is lost in ocean of sand
Where life pass, years! Seeking the skies
Waiting for watery drop
Even like a tear that dropp from my eye
Its not a sorrow of a princess
Whose love is apart
Her affection grows everyday
But she cannot express her heart
Its not agony of a woman
Whose man is on way to disaster
Nor pain of mother
Whose son made devil his master
Its not wail of a child
Whose dreams are broken like stars
Nor pain of those
Whose friends are dying in wars
Its nota lament after tempest
Nor the cry after death
Tear in my eyes
Is due to my inner sorrow
For the world I live in is crying dying
And am I not to grieve over something which is mine?
