Once I heard the song of sadness,
T'was full of melancholy pure.
I sat and listened for what seemed to be forever,
It seemed to be joy's cure.
Never again can you think the same,
Once you've heard such a song.
Never again can you live the same,
Once you know what's truly right and wrong.
I fell into pieces,
I lost all my hope.
I whithered away,
There was no way to cope.
Now I've joined the chior,
I am not alone.
I sing the song of sorrow and madness,
Chilling listeners to the bone.
