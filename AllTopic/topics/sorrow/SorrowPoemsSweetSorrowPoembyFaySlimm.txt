Yes, our partings have progressed to become
Sorrowed but sweet.
Trusting tomorrow, reluctantly we
Tear, discreetly
Away, obeying no impulse to stay.
Holding back beats
Of incredible passion, our hearts now
Part, retreating
With hope that Fate soon discloses some way
Of completing
Destiny's call. Our yearnings, now braided
Round sorrow's feet
Can then seat themselves at Heaven's sweet door.
Then meetings
Can flourish fulfilled, - replete forevermore.
