skin seems roasted by scorching rays
sky is burning by heat of summer
sultry weather remembers autumnâ€™s flow
anger never reels through by fear of love.
softness mellows by sweet feeling
where is smile latching on to hide?
oh emotion be cup of anger retreating
silence even tells grip of sorrow
night still resilient by tear as dew
heart loses its rhythm riling upon wisdom
abstruse stillness redeems from apprehension
as truth of reason always insist upon realty.
Sorrow redounds deep in darkness in furrow
Humor blurs in dearth of rippling smiles
Sadness rides over the glow ingenious
Do you ever measure the distance of love?
