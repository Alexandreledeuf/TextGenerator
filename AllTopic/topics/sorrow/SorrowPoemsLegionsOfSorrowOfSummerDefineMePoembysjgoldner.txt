So I called Jamie
and Michael
and Zach.
After you didn't get back to me.
And then I couldn't sleep,
so I called Eric,
Tom and Bryan.
Because you didn't get back to me.
And I laid awake and counted the crickets'
chirps and thought about the nights
we had spent
in each other's arms-
The conversations over bottles of wine
and delicious, gourmet dinners;
six-packs, hoagies and pizza.
I loved you and I said it.
While you were moisturizing your
elbows and forearms.
I said I loved you and I meant it.
And you told me to `stop.'
To stop and breathe.   Is what you meant.
