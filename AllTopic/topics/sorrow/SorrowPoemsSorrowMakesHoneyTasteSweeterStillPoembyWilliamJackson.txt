Having fallen,
Having failed miserably,
Having lost my bearings,
Having had my spirit broken,
Having been entirely too human,
Having lost my mind but found it again,
I don't know quite what to think of life
except that I still feel deeply and appreciate
that sorrow makes honey taste sweeter still.
