I stand tall as all the misery around me floats
The words when i first heard of the sadness in my life
But i do not budge for i am strong
I walk past all who offer me a kind word to help ease my soul
I decline for I let my strength shine through
Acceptance within my heart I say i am all right
Everyone watches as i walk past and comment on my strength
Some fear that i have no feelings others envy for they hurt so much
I walk through the door of my bedroom and shut it behind me
I fall to my knees and catch myself with my hands as the tears stain the floor
My strength is gone and now my sorrrow envelopes me
My sight is blurred as the pure rain falls from my cheeks
I can not breathe as I realize what happened
After some time i wipe my eyes dry and walk back out with my strength for all to see
