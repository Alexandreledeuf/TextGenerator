If you look
upon Afghani's sorrow
Will you tell...
Does your heart
feel empathy...
Do tears  well
in your eyes...
The life of the Afghan
like open wounds
seeks healing
will kindness you extend
Oh Big Boss!
You the teacher
of brutal behavior
please step aside
for peace and prosperity.
