For the first time in my life
I am silenced by sorrow.
Questions go unspoken.
Answers remain unknown.
Fearing the brutality
of the darkness
I hide.
If I refuse to look too closely
will this still be true tomorrow?
Will you still have suffered
as you did?
Could I plunge
my hand of friendship
through the tar-like darkness
of your world
to bring you light?
Can you see the way out
or must I light a thousand candles
to ignite that part of you
that believes life can be wonderful?
With the first strike of the match....
I offer you a glimmer of hope.
I'll start lighting those candles now
and I won't stop until you see it.
~I'm praying for you Denis.  Please be well.
