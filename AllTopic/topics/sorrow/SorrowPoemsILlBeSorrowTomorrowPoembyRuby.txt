I'll Be Sorrow Tomorrow
I'll be sorrow tomorrow,
With me myself and I.
I'll be sorrow tomorrow,
Holding myself while I cry.
I'll be sorrow tomorrow,
While lying sleepless in my bed.
I'll be sorrow the next day as one thought haunts my head.
And when I finally rest my lids and cease my icy breath,
That one thought will exist no longer,
That horrible thought of death.
