your sorrow and my sorrow
are not really ours to keep.
They belong to the earth,
to the heart of the earth
inside its beautiful bosom.
let us leave them just right
there, secure and honed.
we are leaving now to
another sphere, the one
that we see in our dreams
the more colored ones
feel the excitement, keep
yourself poised to something
more lasting more divine.
