The women of your age I train my eyes on
Remind me of you through some resemblances
And some violent contrasts now and then.
Nose studs and ear drops I see in the shops
Catch my eyes and bring to my view your face.
I imagine the stud worn on your nose
And with that how your nose would tempt my lips.
I imagine the drops hung from your ears
And with that how your ears would prompt me.
When I am lonely you are in my thought;
I dream of passing my hand through your hair
And gazing into your eyes full of love.
To bring this about, I must conquer Fate
As I accuse myself of cowardice.
I have no courage nor propriety
Even to let you know my feelings.
This is my sorrow that cripples my mind.
This is my agony underlining.
