He was undersized
compared to his peers
He waited for his chance
to catch the toss
He ran the final points
that cinched the win
Cheers and accolades
swirled all around
The spectators stood tall
and high-fived
He took it all in stride
smiling shyly
It was his only touchdown
of the season
He was a modest
one-time football hero
