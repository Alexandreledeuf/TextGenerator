As the years grow harder
So do the choices
Should i listen to myself
Or listen to the voices
For over 3 years
Footballs been my thing
I've dealt with failure
I've pushed threw the sting
But now I'm getting older
Classes need attention
Football should be done
But i twitch a the mention
Football is a pain
It's losing what was fun
I want to quit i do
but I'm not quite done
I was okay not tall at all
Now that could change
But to rise I'd have to fall
If i stop i cant start
If i start i cant start
I'm still at the bottom
Oh so far from the top
If i quit now
I can't start again
I'll fall far behind
There's no way I'll win
But if i keep going
My grades will slip
And its not even fun
So i have to get a grip
Well whether i play
or fall apart
Football will stay
Somewhere in my heart
