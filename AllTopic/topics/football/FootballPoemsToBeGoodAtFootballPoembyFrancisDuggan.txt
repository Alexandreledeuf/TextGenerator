To be good at football assures one of local fame
Though outside of your hometown yours is not a known name
For there is quite a difference between good and great
And outside of their hometown local heroes few know of to celebrate
The difference between local, national and Worldwide is huge one can say
And the local heroes as the local heroes do stay
Until the local heroes slow beyond their physical prime
And eventually the local heroes do lose out to time
To be good at football in your hometown
Assures you for awhile of local renown
But the fame of the local heroes in time fades away
And there are young local football heroes in the town today
It does not take that much to be a local hero at all
Since many become local heroes for being good at football.
