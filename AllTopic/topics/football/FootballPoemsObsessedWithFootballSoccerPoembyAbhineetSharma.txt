When the feet kiss the ball,
for all tackles u make,
divine is the feel,
for FOOTBALL is the game,
hell lot of energy,
but passion it demands,
to master the game,
& have its command,
There it goes, into the net,
with a slight li'l bend,
all celebrate, and u get it all,
what all you commend,
with all your strength,
you embrace the ball,
and your timely interception,
saves the GOAL! ! ! ! ! ,
completely exhausted of the effort,
yet, you make the run,
coz the feel of the BALL is gr8,
and feeling it is gr8 fun,
what all it means,
only, a fanatic understands,
no matter whether he is playing,
or is sitting in the stands,
Abhi plays Beckham,
Gopi is Carlos,
Rambo is Maradonna,
and on..., the feel goes...
we have it in our blood,
we have it in our soul,
so are we,
OBSESSED WITH FOOTBALL......
(dedicated to the most beautiful game i have ever played....... I m lovin it.......)
