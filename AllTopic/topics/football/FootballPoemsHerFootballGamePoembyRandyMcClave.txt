I told her that her two teams weren't playing
She said those were lies that I was saying,
Her ex had told her that the game was on today
As so did another friend of hers did say.
I showed and I again told her that there was no game
Again and again that statement I did truthfully proclaim,
But, my words she did not want to believe
Which broke my heart and made me sad and grieve.
I told her that we could watch another game here
She said "NO! " she'll watch with a friend and a beer,
So, I drove her to her friends house to watch the event
I watched the game alone at my house, while she was absent.
I guess in her mind I was the visiting team
As in my thoughts and her actions that is truly how it did seem,
That was for certain my final and truthful analysis
Sadly, the home town advantage was all of his.
She stayed at her male friend's house for a couple hours
While alone watching the game I wanted that time to be ours,
She then admitted to me that her two teams never played
So, instead at her friends she got laid.
