Never cared much about football, even less about
the Cardinals.
Pat Tillman rose above the football field, reached
out and touched our lives with his love.
Pat's heart encircled all Americans as he went
overseas to fight for our freedom and continued
safety.
To hear of his death this morning was devastating,
I can't imagine what his family is feeling.
Hopefully, this poem holds some of what Pat meant
to all of us.
