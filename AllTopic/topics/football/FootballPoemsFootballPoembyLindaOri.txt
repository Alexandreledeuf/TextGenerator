Football is my favorite game
I love to watch them play -
Those tightly muscled butts and legs
On an awesome autumn day;
How fluidly and gracefully
They dance across the green -
Such elegant contenders play
The best I've ever seen;
Some people think I'm crazy
The way I love the game -
But I'd rather be watching football
Than anything I can name;
Of course I may be prejudiced
I love my maise and blue -
That BIG 10 team that rules the league.............
You rock the Big House - BLUE! ! !
