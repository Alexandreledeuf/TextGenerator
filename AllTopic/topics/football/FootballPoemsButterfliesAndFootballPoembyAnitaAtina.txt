On a sunny day, that warmed the winter breeze
Running with laughter and children,
With butterflies flitting oâ€™er bobbing heads,
Coyly swaying grass,
Smiling up to clear blue skies!
Little sparrows twitter startled,
From their gentle snooze in the shadows.
Happy shouts play pass, with stomping feet
Arms waving, jumping
This way, this way! And goallll! ! !
