Football is a contact sport;
In short—a “rough” game.
It may leave you dancing,
Or it could leave you lame.
Armed with helmets, jerseys
And spandex tights—
All tough dudes,
Ready for the fight.
Digging in with spiked shoes,
And war paint on their face.
Staring down the adversary—
No mercy and no grace.
Tackles, hits and yard runs.
The scoring of “touchdowns, ”
With each team striving
For the coveted crown.
Whether dancing, banged or lame—
‘Tis the nature of the game.
And that’s okay with football fans,
They love it just the same.
