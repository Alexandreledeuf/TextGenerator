Let children play football or basketball.
They would experience camaraderie,
Team spirit and togetherness.
They would learn bearing failures and defeats
And abiding by rules and regulation.
They would develop reflex action
Necessary for spontaneous response.
They would develop a steel physique.
Let children waste in football or basketball.
