Life is like a football game
When you score a goal, you must play hard to defend it
And even harder to score more goals,
If you concede a goal,
You have to put all your energy to equalize
And score a winner.
If you score a goal and become complacent, your opponent
Will come from behind and give you a surprise…
If you lose hope because you conceded a goal,
Then you are a loser because you will concede more goals.
The spectators support tantamount the effort
you put in the game.
If you win the match, they become part of
The winning team,
If you lose, they will make do with the
Satisfaction of an entertaining game,
If you go down fighting,
They will always find a reason for your
Losing the game,
And to lose a match becomes a lesson on how to win next one.
