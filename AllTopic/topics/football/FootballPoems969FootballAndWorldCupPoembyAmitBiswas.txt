I still remember those childhood days,
We could not go where the big brother plays,
But we had our tiny little niche,
Around the balconies, where maids wash the dish,
Round the year was our football season,
Much cheaper than cricket was the reason,
Did not have the boots to play with,
Bare-foot or pain was no reason to quit,
We did have our own competition,
Apart from fun and the strenuous lessons,
World cup was too far, had no knowledge,
Affluent always had over us an edge,
86â€™ was the first world cup I watched,
WOW the number of goals than Maradona notched,
But this time Chennaites may not be as lucky,
CAS for signal carrier has made our fate shaky.
CAS: Is Conditional Access System for the Pay Channels, which many households do not have.
