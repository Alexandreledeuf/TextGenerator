I loved to play football,
That night I dreamt that
I was tirelessly running and running with the ball
To score a goal,
But in spite of my utmost effort,
I failed to score it again and again,
Finally when I succeeded to score the spectacular goal,
I found that I had already lost the match,
All my efforts were in vain.
