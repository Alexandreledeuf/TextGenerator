Dear God save me from my fate.
I’ve ravaged a whole plate of tacos,
wasn’t at all dainty or sweet;
I’m afraid the results won’t be discreet.
Crazy of me but it was getting late;
so I ate with gusto and zest
knowing later on it would
probably kill me at best.
Tonight it’s really hard to care.
I’m schlumped in my easy chair
ready to watch football playoffs
with a bottle of my favorite brew;
enjoy a much anticipated view.
I will most likely meet my justified end,
but, ahh-h-h, ………. what a way to go!
