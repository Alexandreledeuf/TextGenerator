Bands playing familiar songs.
The majorettes with their batons.
Cheerleaders wowing the crowds on.
And cheering fans—old and young.
Illumining the broad field,
The lights shine clear and bright;
And from the tall, slender poles—
They glisten through the night.
Teams pitted against each other,
Gearing up for the game:
An American favorite pastime—
Football is the name.
