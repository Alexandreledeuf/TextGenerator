The greatest football catch got caught
By Odell Beckham, rookie pro.
He had run down the field a lot
To try to catch a real long throw.
Interfered with in his pursuit,
He got his right hand to the ball,
And three fingered the ball in route,
Pulling it in as he did fall,
Stretched backwards landing on his back,
Inside the end zone and in bounds.
Odell's got quite a catching knack,
And results in a touchdown - zounds!
Odell ode is called for on it.
Oh heck - it deserves a sonnet.
