Have you seen a football match?
In a field two goal-keepers' catch.
What do they catch and for why?
They catch ball for non-goal, bye.
Have you watched dance in ground?
Make cheerful players spend pound.
In round dancers come, dance enjoy,
Football world cup fills all with joy.
It takes place among two teams,
Team has eleven players' beams.
Around the field players do stand,
Goal posts are two each side bland.
A referee is there, makes them play,
He blows whistle when finds a clay.
Player to player does pass the ball,
Co-operations vanish atrocities all.
Players run referee does dance, act
Ball dances in sky and ground fact.
Spectators dance and run in cheer,
They say hip- hip hurray in a gear.
Scorer scores the ball for a goal,
Certain aim and effort reach to goal.
Hard labour doesn't go in vain,
Laborious parties win and gain.
Spectators cheer and enjoy the game,
They get affection, fraternity and fame.
Love, nonviolence develop among them,
Players maintain health in this game.
