Being alert
says an expert
till the last seconds
That's about the present
world championship football
now still going on in Russia
Thinking of the match of yesterday
Japan thinks it wins from Belgium hurray!
this team will go to the Quarterfinal
But Japan became inassertive
Belgium changes a tired player with a temporary one
it's all in the game, but Japan must still be assertive
in the last five seconds Japan's victory has gone
that Belgium's temporary player
had gained that victory, now he has become a top player
Belgium goes to the quarterfinal
utmost glee because of this
most specially exceptional
That's why being alert will not suffice
being assertive is the only option all there is
five whole seconds before the signal of the umpire
a temporary player has set the Belgium team on fire!
with 3-2 they may still stay in the Russia sans wire.

Victory day for the Belgium team
=====================================
ADDITION:
Japan VS Belgium 2-3 Victory for the Belgium Team.
IF I may SAY: The Team of Japan must still be attentive, be alert and especially BE ASSERTIVE. Japan must still keep attacking the Belgian goal and must still have that behaviour as in WW II, aggressive and
all. They lost because of their own fault, it looked like they were awaiting the end signal of the umpire. YES, I have watched them too,
otherwise I could not create this poem and tell you all these here as my Notes. BE ASSERTIVE and BE ACTIVE, WATCH and OBSERVE CONSTANTLY, till the final signal of the umpire.
In Dutch we say: "Eigen schuld, dikke bult" It is an idiom, so no
suitable translation.
