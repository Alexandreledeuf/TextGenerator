The beauty of the golden days,
Where the great adventure began,
On a field where we all sang,
Sang cheerfully with our fans,
We were head on head,
We had a solid back,
A positioned middle
And a stronger front,
The score was one all,
The previous goals were jokes,
They were just shots without effect,
Hits without desire
We try scoring but fail,
They attack we defend,
We push hard but regret it at the end,
The match was too even that it couldn't be decided,
A substitution occurred,
Leaving us in shock,
Leaving us blank minded,
Leaving us distracted with our thoughts,
It seemed like nothing mattered anymore,
We are champions now forever more,
Not a single soul would be able to take it from us,
But oh how I was wrong about that,
