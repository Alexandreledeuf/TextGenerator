In the retinue of
The carrion and paper airplanes
Contrived-
Careening forwards through the
Madness of
Dishonor-
The waves like the
Zygotes of misinformed poltergeists;
Until irretrievably other
Avenues
With friends and
Lights
Offering sweet fruits buttered with meats
At the doorsteps of
The wildfires of unresolved holidays-
Already smothered underfoot,
And carefully dishonored,
Blinded-
The diamonds of a unrequited
Nest,
Pilfered to the aeries of
Amnesiac stewardesses;
And in this way misplaced forever
Into the firmament of
Simulacrum and marionettes
Holding their breath futilely as she drives away
Without a second look down the highway
Of a football playerâ€™s boredom.
