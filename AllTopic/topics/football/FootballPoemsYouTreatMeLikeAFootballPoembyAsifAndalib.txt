I can’t forget those days baby
No I can't forget at all
When you used to love me madly
When I was only your doll!
You have loose character
I have known it later
It has driven me crazy
Baby I feel so lonely!
Baby I am not bad at all
But you treat me like a football
That’s why now I curse you
But I pray for you too!
Baby now I hate you
As much as I love you
You are like my favorite food
Baby I am not very good!
