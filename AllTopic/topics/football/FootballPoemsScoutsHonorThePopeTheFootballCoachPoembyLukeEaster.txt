Oh wow! Seems like every channel has the exact same story,
The most storybook football program has tarnished it’s glory,
At the Mighty Penn State where the winningest coach resides,
Amidst allegations of child sexual abuse the emotions runs high.
Did he or did he not, why wasn’t more done to help protect?
Those in a program designed to rise above hurt and neglect,
Started by an assistance coach whose job was the defense,
Not designed to recruit the adolescent under false pretense.
Joe Paterno has the most football wins by a college coach,
Supposedly his 2 national title program is above reproach,
But, just like the sex abuse scandal within the Boy Scouts,
Along with that powerful Catholic Church, better look out.
The names of the innocent victims abused are at least nine,
And amazingly over a known period of 12-15 years time,
Not through innuendo, hearsay or speculation it was seen,
Yet like the Catholic Church more important was the green.
Again dead presidents again took priority over child welfare,
Under those in authority whose main responsibility is to care,
One 60-year-old man naked with a likewise 10-year-old boy,
Alone it the shower on campus, like a toddler with a new toy.
To do whatever he willed over the child unable to fight back,
How many times before & since helpless when under attack?
But wait this time there’s an eyewitness of the dastardly deed,
Still it’s to no avail because in athletics the bottom line is greed.
Many who knew actually lied to the Grand Jury, okay let’s see,
High-ranking officials resigned & the president of the university?
As the nation ponders who is the next to beheaded by the axe?
Explain why the focus is on football not victims, what a sad fact.
So, should the man who passed the buck be allowed to coach?
Is not the Cardinal who overlooked mass rape now the Pope?
We need a real life Terminator to protect kids like John Connor,
Those who have Arnold’s role failed miserably, Scout’s Honor.
