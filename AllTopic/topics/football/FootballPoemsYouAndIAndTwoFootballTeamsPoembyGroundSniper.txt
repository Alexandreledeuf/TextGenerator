you and i
met not long ago
you and i
were a thing of love
we were idolized by all
then the day came
you cheated on me
with the football team
what happened?
to you and i?
i didnt expect you to do this
i let my guard fall
and now as the open woulds bleed through
my heart cant take any more
but as the days go on without you
the wounds do not close
do not heal
my heart weakens more and more
then i heard
you slept with the visiting football team
the same night
as you slept with our home team
i cant take this anymore
you betrayed me
and our home football team
you slept with the visiting team
this is the final blow to my heart
as i walk into your house
i load my nine
i walk into your room
and look you in the eye
despite the other 3 men there
i empty my entire clip
into your slim tan body
i save one bullet
to end my hearts pain
the other 3 men
long gone now
i am now with you
and you are
with only me
we ended up together
yet again
just you and i
