Football is played with heart
There will always be someone better than you
It is like life, you can get knocked down but youâ€™re the one to make the decision to get up
Everybody gets knocked down but it is your decision to get back up and fight back
Spirit is like pride and team is like family
Your family at home is there to help you just like your team
Big or small winning is the option you just need spirit
Emotions are part of the game and make you strive for gold
One day will be the last time for you to put on pads
I just witnessed seniors putting their pads on for the last time
It made me realize great things come to an end
Late in the years I know I could go to any of them because they are my second family
