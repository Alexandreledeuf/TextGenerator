(Grand Evangelical Mission,10th of May 2009, Agro Football Field, Davao City, commemorating the 123rd birth anniversary of Ka Felix Y. Manalo, God's last messenger)
Throngs of believers and non-believers
assembled together into one herd
to cheer not up spectacular soccer game
but to listen the Church of Christ
evangelical expose' aim
Caravans of jeeps, boats, buses alike
faithful followers, marching with streamers
peace-governing authority with shimmering light
of overwhelming joy and unifying gratitude
in celebrating God's last messenger
123rd birthday
Celebration's highlights unlike pagan feasts
nor mix with worldly dance, pleasure and flesh
but by grace of imparting God's messages
in these last days
spreading plain biblical doctrines and prophecies
the gospel of truth for those
who are willing to be saved
Literal thunderstorms
and season rains are showering
but they never defeats nor shakes
even by little drip of attempt
for the brethrens with stronghold aim
rain or shine
Grand Evangelical Mission begins
As the ball of faith
starts rolling
echoing beyond soccer goal team
innumerable blind-folded souls
have been awaken
