We all love and applaud the winners
As we feel sorry for the losers
We love women, without them, we're nobody
Women are the fruits and the gems of our society
Whoopee! Congratulations to the USA Women's Soccer Team
For winning their fourth World Cup. This is a dream
For everybody to be champions
This is an outstanding accomplishment
Let's all enjoy this wonderful moment
Hurrah! Yippee! These women are heroes of actions
We are proud of them. They deserve at least equal pay
For equal work. I pray that nothing stands in their way
Thank you for the great soccer/football skills
That you have shown throughout the tournament
In France.Your ladies are lovely, winsome and elegant
You inspire me and give me enough energies and chills
To never give up, to work hard or to strive to succeed
May God grant all good health to survive and to lead!
