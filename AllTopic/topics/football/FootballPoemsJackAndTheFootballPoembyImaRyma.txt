Cornhuskers college football game,
Fourth quarter and time almost out,
A 7 year old - Jack's his name,
Touch downed the hearts of all - no doubt!
The how and why of Jack then there
Was for the what was good for Jack.
Handed the ball, he ran through air,
Sixty nine yards, not looking back.
Sixty thousand fans, none dry eyed,
Watched Jack score and a win, welcome.
And Jack won hearts of all worldwide,
And Jack's feelings, 'It was awesome.'
Jack ran and scored, troubles behind,
His brain cancer not on his mind.
