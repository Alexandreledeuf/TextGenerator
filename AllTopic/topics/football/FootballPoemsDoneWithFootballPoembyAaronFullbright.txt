as the years grow harder
so do the choices
should i listen to myself
or listen to the voices
for over three years
football's been my thing
i dealt with the failure
i pushed through the sting
but now im getting older
classes need attention
football should be done
but i twitch at the mention
football is a pain
it's losing what was fun
i want to quit i do
but im not quite done
i was the worst
no good at all
now that could change
but to rise id have to fall
if i stop i can't start
if i start i can't stop
im still at the bottom
oh so far from the top
if i quit now,
i can't start again
i'll fall far behind
there's no way ill win
but if i keep going
my grades may slip
and it's not even fun
so i have to get a grip
well whether i play
or i fall apart
football will stay
somewhere in my heart
