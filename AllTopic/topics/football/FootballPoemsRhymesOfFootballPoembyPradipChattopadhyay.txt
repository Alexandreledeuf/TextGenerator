Net to net rolls the ball
with the feet fast they scroll
the kicks find the bar too small
too hard to score a goal!
Sweats it out the forward
saves it tough the one at back
like a fort he must guard
not allow a crack!
On the grass no guide or map
rely on footwork skill
pierce the defense find the gap
go for the lethal kill!
The ball if once finds the net
stop breath a million soul
mourns the side in sealed fate
the air is rend with GOAL! ! ! !
