When I am full of anger
I think in anger's terms
Part of my existing life
Is full of anger's germs
Nothing seems a perfect right
Most of things gone wrong
I get such vengeful feelings
When I carry anger along
When I think of forgiveness
I think in forgiveness' terms
My life is held in gentle hands
Softly in those twists and turns
Very few are perfect wrongs
So many things are right
Show me God forgiveness' face
So I can live in light
