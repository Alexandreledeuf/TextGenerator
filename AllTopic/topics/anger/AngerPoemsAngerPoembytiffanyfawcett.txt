Anger
I keep it all inside
I keep it close to my side
For If I lose it all
Heaven knows I'll die
I let it go
I breathe it in
It keeps coming back
For it is my sin
It's burned in me
It haunts me day & night
Carved into my core
It is my only sight
It's the only thing I know
It's all that is me
It's the only emotion I show
I wish I could be free
Anger
