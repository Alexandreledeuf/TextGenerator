Anger spreads poison in mind
Destruction it leaves behind.
It snatches all our senses
And increases all our expenses.
Bloody sword in its hands it keeps
And climbs up on thoughts bulky heaps.
It becomes blind in its darkness
Hatred it can only express.
It cuts and bites with nails and teeth
Thorns ae spread  in flowery heath.
It casts eclipse to sun and moon
But when is punctured its baloon
Often it sits with head on knees
And is heard saying ' please, please, please.'
