anger is not love
anger is driking
anger is killing someone
anger one thing never do
love, anger love not anger
anger is ramming you head throug a glass door
when your  are man you do stupid things
stupid things that are stupid
when mad you dont feel nuthing
anger we all have
anger you cant change
when mad stays
stay away from everyone
anger can kill because you do stupid things
when mad sleep
anger just anger
ANGER
