His anger is a hard summer storm,
Unpredictable and uncontrollable
Like the rain his anger falls upon countless victims.
Like the wind his anger lashes out upon the innocent
Like a summer storm his anger comes
And like a summer storm his anger goes.
It leaves behind destruction and kayos
Dismay and suffering.
His anger comes and it goes
And with all brings, It causes only pain.
