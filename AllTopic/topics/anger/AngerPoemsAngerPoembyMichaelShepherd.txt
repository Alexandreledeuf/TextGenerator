Epictetus the stoic philosopher said
that anyone who angers you becomes your master
by disturbing you;
Well, that's me -
full of righteous and unrighteous anger;
on the other hand,
God gets pretty hot in the O.T. -
Are there different rules?
After all, we both know we're right.
And don't ask me what 'religion' I am, OK?
Or I could get really angry...
