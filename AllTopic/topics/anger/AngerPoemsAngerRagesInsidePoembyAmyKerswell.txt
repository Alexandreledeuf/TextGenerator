Anger is bubbling away at me.
Burning a whole in my heart.
Making me burn with rage.
I have good reason to be angry.
I only wish
I could make them pay.
Put them through
What they did to me.
Anger is destroying me.
For Im hell bent on revenge..
I would love to dish out.
My own justice.
But I cant.
Anger Buabbles away.
Like a swishing sound
Of the waves.
Like a brook babbles
Anger takes ahold.
