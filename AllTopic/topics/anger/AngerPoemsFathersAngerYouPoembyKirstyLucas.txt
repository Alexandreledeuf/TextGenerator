Fathers anger you
But you love them
Fathers hurt you on the inside
But you love them
Fathers get drunk
But you love them
Fathers are always out with the ‘boys’
But you love them
My father is all ways there for me on one thing though
Wether angry, painful, drunk, or even out with the boys.
He is always there me when I need him the most.
