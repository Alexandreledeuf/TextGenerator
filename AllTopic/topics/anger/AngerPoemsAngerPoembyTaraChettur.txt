My house, is burning under fire?
I’m gathering proof!
To accuse my neighbor
I scuffle I ruffle I shuffle the things!
Still I can’t get hold of my anger!
If someone could tell me
What should I do with my anger?
Those who saved the lives
The real heroes
Would they come back?
To tell the tale…
To tell what should we do?
To gather the proof or retaliate?
What should I do with my anger?
My house, my nation is burning under fire!
