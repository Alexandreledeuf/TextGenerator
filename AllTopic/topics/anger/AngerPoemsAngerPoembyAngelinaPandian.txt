Anger is the Banyan seed
I secreted in the darkness of my heart
I thought I hid it well from everyoneâ€™s view
Until the day I woke up to find it fill
My heart mind and soul
Roots, branches, aerial roots to support
A thick trunk no reason could uproot
Anger was just a seed when I forgot
To forgive and hid in my heart!
