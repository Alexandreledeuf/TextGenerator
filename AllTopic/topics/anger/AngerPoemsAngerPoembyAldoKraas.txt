Anger builds up inside of me like a volcano ready to explode
The anger inside of me grows like cancer spreading fast and Destroying me
But that anger has to come out some how
Before it kills me and builds up inside of me
There are times that is not good for me to show my anger to myself And others because it is very destructive
Sometimes it is difficult for me to control my anger
