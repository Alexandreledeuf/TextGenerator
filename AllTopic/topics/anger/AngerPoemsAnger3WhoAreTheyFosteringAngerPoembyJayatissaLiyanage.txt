They are your own kids, cos,
They were conceived within you
They were nourished, nurtured,
fostered and brought up by you.
High time you realized that
these fiends are your own children
And still not too late to hold them by nose,
provided you have the desire, commitment â€˜n courage.
They all are fiends within you
Controlling them, is your baby
No one else in the whole universe
Could or would do that for you.
