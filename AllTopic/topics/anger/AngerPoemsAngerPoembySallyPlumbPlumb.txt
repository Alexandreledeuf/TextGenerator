Anger threatens
and bursts throught fast.
The swelling breast
stretches the sinews
of all being.
With strife the builds
of some betrayel clings
to mind, a length
of memory springs
bringing into combat
all focuses of strength.
Restrained the sighing heart
descends the peak,
resting uneasily
and declaring weak.
