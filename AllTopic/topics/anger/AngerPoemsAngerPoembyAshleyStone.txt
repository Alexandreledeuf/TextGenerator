Inexplainable is her mood
Undescribable is her mood
No smile, no frown
Never up and never down
She's merely a body taking up space
Sucking in air, never changing her face
Starring in plain dismay
Aloof
Whenever you look upon her face
Anger is what you think
She doesn't smile and she doesn't shout
She simply stares filled with doubt
Questions run through her mind
Am I happy or am I mad?
Anger is what she should feel
After all she's been through
Instead,
She's just here
