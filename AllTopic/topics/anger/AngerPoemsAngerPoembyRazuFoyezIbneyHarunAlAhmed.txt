How is anger escaped?
It stays deep within me.
I think about what is lost,
and the anger rises inside of me.
Every where I look,
I see what should be mine.
Envy turns to anger,
I think to myself 'who are these people? ,
they do not deserve such a thing I have lost'
I think about what is lost,
and the anger rises inside of me.
It rises to such a degree,
that anger turns to tears.
