You like to talk in your sleep.
Your dream must be so deep.
You say the words I want to hear.
You say you always want me near.
And I know that its true
Cause I hear it
When I'm sleeping next to you.
And in the morning when you wake,
My hand you will take.
You will put it to your heart,
And the day we will start.
And when you're dreaming again in bed
I'll hear the loving things that will be said.
