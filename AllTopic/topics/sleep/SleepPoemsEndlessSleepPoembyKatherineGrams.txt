My lungs respond, but there's no air,
As I struggle to survive,
It hurts to know that they don't care,
Whether or not I stay alive.
The world is growing dark now,
As I drift toward the light.
I want to cry out somehow;
If I had the strength, I might.
I feel like I am falling,
Into a great abyss.
I hear past loved ones calling,
As I taste Death's tender kiss.
Finally, I have found some peace;
My soul is God's to keep.
I have finally gained release,
By slipping into endless sleep.
