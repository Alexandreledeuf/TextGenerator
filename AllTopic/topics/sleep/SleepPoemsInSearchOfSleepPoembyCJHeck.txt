Sleep, you ornery rascal,
why is it you elude me?
Like a crush, you tease the senses,
you taunt me with your charms.
Needing you, I'm bribed and baited,
much smitten with desire.
Your allure in awkward places
has me always hiding yawns.
You deflower me in a movie,
you corrupt me on my couch.
Should you take up prostitution,
might I gladly buy some time?
Sleep come take me lying down,
not driving in my car!
Then sighing in depravity,
again I call from bed -
Sleep, you naughty pervert,
I want you, take me now!
