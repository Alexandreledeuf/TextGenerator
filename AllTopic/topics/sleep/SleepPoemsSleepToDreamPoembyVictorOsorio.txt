Time to rest our eyes
We visit imagination
Best vacation of mind
Hidden desires, lost memories
Hopeful prayers aren't blind
Stand up and speak clear
When in real time-we sleep
Viewing is on the clock
More thoughts to keep
Time to rest in hours
Dreaming in peace
Sleeping in peace
Fear isn't common
Occuring once a blue
Control your eyes
Wake up for two
This is a test
Prepare for life
Dream to make
Sleep to dream.
