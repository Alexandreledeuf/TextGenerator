She sleeps as my tired old eyes make love to her....
Her long grey hair frames her gentle face and softly touches
Both of her round and dimpled alabaster colored shoulders
My sense of smell is enticed beyond any simple fantasy
The fullness of her gardenia powdered hips and thighs
Leave me breathless and still filled with the same anticipation
As when we were both so young....
I find that one spot in the small of her back with my fingers
And without disturbing her
I place a warm wet kiss there for my safe keeping...
