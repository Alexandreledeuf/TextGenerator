Sleep, sleep, sleep
And keep
Eyes open
To feel in heaven
I shall come
To welcome
And take in arms
To keep you warm
I shall remind
You to find me
In your presence
Without feeling tense
This is the life that we wanted
And felt so excited
The dream is realized
You look so dazed
It is reality
That has been blessed by an almighty
Let us not be carried away
But cheerfully stay
