When the Sun shines brightly
Don't stay in the cricket field.
You are sick, you don't know
People are more sick than you.
If you feel bad, if you sweat
And ask for a glass of water
They won't give you.
Even the woman for whose ward
You collapsed to death.
Sleep gently, sleep,
Don't awake until I call you.
The blunt faced devils are there
Ready to give you hemlock.
They killed you, they pushed you
To the darkest domain.
Yet, you are pure, gentle, lovable.
Which dream did you dream
When you were leaving this world?
The chuckle and the half-closed eye,
Your words, voice haunt me always.
Be there near the forest of love
Unless get you.
Or sleep dear sleep until I call you!
