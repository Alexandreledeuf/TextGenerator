Rising to the surface
of morning altitude
Often the awakening more
than just a little rude
Yet sometimes the moment's sweet
(and frequently not a little lewd) ...
Floating to billowy consciousness
this day, all soft and warm and nude
(Whoops, that last is not germane at
all, forgive me for a boob!)
Hugging pillow tightly to my
breast, the softness deep and  good...
Join me in smashing down the alarm
as we drift back to limbo's mood
Slip away to that nether region
of freefall slowed and vision skewed
Cuddle up to what you wish, my
love, as rough reality we elude...
