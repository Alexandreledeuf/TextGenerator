Her happy world
A lovely mould
For a scream she gets her food
For another she gets all the good
Cute toys all around
She gets sleep abound
Sleeps as she loves
Screams as she likes!
World of love, world of joy
Till it becomes a broken toy
Let her sleep undisturbed
Lest on age can't be unperturbed!
She may not be spared
Of
Pleasure of love
Pain of its failure
Evil of dowry
Pangs of treachery
Spasm of sexism
Childhood marriage
Agony of miscarriage
Early widowhood
Cruelty of poverty
Vulturous eyes
Casting evil sight
At her long curly hair
And handsome features
Making her a helpless creature!
Let her sleep undisturbed
Amidst her toys duly clutched!
Before she blossoms
Let us hasten
A world order
That Respects women
Extols her virtues
Encourages equality
Ennobles the society!
