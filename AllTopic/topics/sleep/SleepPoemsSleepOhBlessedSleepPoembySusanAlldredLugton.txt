Sleep oh blessed sleep,
the place where I can dream,
of all that I do need
my energy to keep.
Sleep oh blessed sleep,
The place of future hope,
in places far away,
and  love for me to keep
Sleep oh blessed sleep
Lull me with your content,
Keep me ever safe my
souls sanity to keep.
Sleep oh blessed sleep,
Let me emerge at morn,
With clearer thought and mind,
with no more need to weep
