Marriage is a bond of love
sealed under the eyes of God.
An arrangement of love for one another,
and the enrichment of their two lives.
Wedding Anniversaries celebrate
the bond of both man and wife,
of their choice to live together
for the rest of their lives.
So as we say Happy Wedding Anniversary to someone.
We are celebrating two people
whose lives have now become one.
We are wishing them love,
luck for the future
and that more anniversaries
they will share together.
Happy Wedding Anniversary Meggie
with many many more to come.
From a special friend.
