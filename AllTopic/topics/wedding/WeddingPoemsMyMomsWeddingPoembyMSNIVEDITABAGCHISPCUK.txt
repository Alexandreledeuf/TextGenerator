Humble submission: ~ India gives highest tribute to Motherhoodness. Women are considered as embodiment of Mother. Here in Poem Hunter I’d rare privilege to get all love, psychic solace and support from Mom Almedia. As I’m reared in Indian milieu it was not difficult for me to accept Ma’am Almedia as Mom [vide ‘OMNI PERVADING MOTHER’].
To quote Mom [23.10.10] ‘I will read one of your poems at my wedding dinner on the 7th of November… I'm wearing sori [sari] on my wedding day’.
Wow! ~ Wow! ! ~ Wow! ! ! Spellbound and dumbfounded I’m Mom by  your nectarine love for me.
Mom I wish salubrious and spic peace [Shanti] ~ wee niv.
Today I’ve also posted one poetry [Paean] which is also on wholesome Motherhoodness.

Falling love is innate and incurable
Unchallangbly dependably durable
There will be flowething bliss unstoppable
Vibe escalation catharsis in all inflatable
May All Highest bestow love calorie inextinguishable
Is the sincere prayer of wee niv is unfathomable.
Why fuss for age
Ride and rally on sledge
Explore explode in ablaze
Bloom and boom in made for each other tutelage
Savor love care share bear bare in life’s mileage.
