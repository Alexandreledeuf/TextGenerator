It finally snapped!
It had become tighter
over the years.
He pretended he didn’t notice
that his finger was growing
around the ring.
He assured me it didn’t hurt,
claimed his finger was always
that shade of purple,
but yesterday it was stretched
beyond it’s limits
and it just snapped.
He was pushing a shopping cart
(of all things!)
buying the needed supplies
to cook me a special dinner.
He stood there
like a deer caught in the headlights
not sure what to do.
Does this say something
about our marriage?
Did he really think our love
was dependant on a ring?
I grabbed his hand and looked
where the ring had been.
That finger looked so painful
the ring had actually left
a permanent imprint
as if his finger was made
of play dough.
I couldn’t help but wonder
if that is how our marriage has felt to him.
Confining, painful and restrictive………
I will buy him a new ring,
One that allows his finger room
To breathe and move freely
just as I want him to feel
in this marriage.
