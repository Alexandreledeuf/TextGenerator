She opened her eyes and dawn
Entered her mind,  falling
Into her heart it sparkled
With rose-petal joy, imparting
A light to her thoughts.  Today
She was to be wed, shaky
She rose and looked around
At the brightening room proudly.
Wedding gown hung dreamily
And appeared very unreal.
Cream lace, studded with roses
And pearls, it shone, imposing
A tender glow to her soul.
This day she would be wholly
His, and the image gave blush
To her cheeks, - then a crushing
Thought filled her with painful
Foreboding - - - he would again
Be away  to  war  before
The day was done.  With awful
Blight on wedded bliss, fear crept
Over her heart,  and she wept.
