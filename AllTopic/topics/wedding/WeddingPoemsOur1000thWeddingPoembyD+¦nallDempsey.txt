Delighted
you undo my tie
then use it to
pull me to you
button
by
button
undo
slowly my shirt
cuffs
with lustful laughter.
Then just
as suddenly you
cry
weep bitterly unexpectedly.
'Shhhhhh! '
I hold you
close to me
ask why
dry your tears with kisses.
'Sometimes...'
(through tears you tell me)
'I love you so
much
I wonder
what would I do
if I were
to lose you...? '
I sweep you
off your feet
carry you
like a bride to bed
swear to marry you
each night forever.
This, then
is our 1,000th wedding.
