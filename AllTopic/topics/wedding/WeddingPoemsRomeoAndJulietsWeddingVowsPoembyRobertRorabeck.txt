Juliet:
I will be thy chased rose and take thy name.
My heart will continue drumming its love for you the same;
And though thy mother and father mean nothing to me—
You are the sun rising over the bosom of my heart’s sea.
I will go with you hand in young hand
And be like your shadow roaming with you across the land.
In your eyes I see the myriad truths of my own soul
A kaleidoscope of sea shells in a pretty bowl—
To  you, my love, I will always be true—
And that is why I say that I do—
Romeo:
To think that the very sun I saw last night should so suddenly be mine
It gives me proof, at last, in a god that is kind—
For to you, I will be the very bird returning to burn in your sky:
And every night, I hope that with you in bed I lie—
So happy I am that you should become the rose that bares my name—
To your midnight’s balcony I am so glad I came—
Now if we can only escape the dark fate I am so afraid that I see
And that you can go on forever with me.
Now let me take your lips to my lips
and share for a moment an eternity’s bliss.
