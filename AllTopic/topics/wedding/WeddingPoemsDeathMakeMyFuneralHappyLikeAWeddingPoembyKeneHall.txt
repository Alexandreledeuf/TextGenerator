Make my funeral happy when my life as gone
Dress in rainbow colours nothing dark and drab
Smile though your hearts are aching
Send me off with a King Cole song
My darling wife all thru my life my kids and theirs
I love you all, give a toast have a dance and really stand up tall
Shed a tear of course but finish off, with a grin
Turn this into a happy day God approves it ain’t no sin
Bring on the clowns and dancers, cakes and fun
Open all the doors and fill the place with sun
Fill your hearts with joy in knowing I’m dressed in white and
Dancing in the clouds and see, my quickstep makes it rain
I promise to you all I will rest in peace if after this day
You will live every day in happiness and pursue your dreams of joy
Then if you do I assure you they will all come true...........
God bless you's all
