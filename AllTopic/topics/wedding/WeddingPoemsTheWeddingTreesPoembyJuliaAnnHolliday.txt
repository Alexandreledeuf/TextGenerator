The flowering cherries
Flowing and pink,
Blossoms, like snow
Fall to the ground,
Never making a sound.
Like pink confetti,
Their petals are ready.
They must be The Wedding Trees.
I'll get married under one of these.
I, d like to get married
In satin and bows,
As petals fall on my clothes,
And scent touches my nose,
As I tingle at the toes.
So just hold my hand,
And we'll stroll through the land,
Tears roll down my face,
In this Heavenly place,
This is my Wedding day!
