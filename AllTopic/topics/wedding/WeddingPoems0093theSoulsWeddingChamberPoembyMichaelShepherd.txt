Night falls, so gently, from the darkening sky,
soft calling us to leave all that the day
has shone upon; from universal light
to turn to homely private lamp, and seek
what evening's quiet brings our close-knit souls.
Then, love, as midnight calls us to our rest,
lay down the things of day, and mount the stair
to that so private chamber where our love
may seek the oneness in our otherness,
enjoy distinction in our single sight;
put out the light, lay down the he and she
to seek the god and goddess of sweet night.
Thus is the soul to God, and God to soul;
in loving dark unknowing, love known whole.
