If I was a ghost in love
Walking veiled in mystery
I would ask a ghostly dove
to take a message to thee
Flying down from above
Asking you to marry me
From the spectoral one you love
Strange as this might be
On this October night
I think  that it might be
For our guests a terrible fright
To see what they  will see
And will they hear the I do's
Against the sea of wails
And will you always be true
To a lover who's very pale
