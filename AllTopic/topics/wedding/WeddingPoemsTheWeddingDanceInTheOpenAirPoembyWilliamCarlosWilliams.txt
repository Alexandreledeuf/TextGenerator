Disciplined by the artist
to go round
and round
in holiday gear
a riotously gay rabble of
peasants and their
ample-bottomed doxies
fills
the market square
featured by the women in
their starched
white headgear
they prance or go openly
toward the wood's
edges
round and around in
rough shoes and
farm breeches
mouths agape
Oya !
kicking up their heels
