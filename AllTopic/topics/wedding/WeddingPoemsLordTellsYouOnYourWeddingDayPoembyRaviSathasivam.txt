I will make the sun shine bright on your wedding day
and I will make your night as a  beautiful and peaceful one
I will make the heaven to throw his blessings to you
and I will show you how much I love you my son
Today is your wedding day and its the most beautiful day for you
A man and a woman promise each other in front of me to live together forever
and an oath of life between both of you can not be broken till the end
Trust each other and make your journey to the greatest love
Have a faith on me then I will protect you in many ways
and I will make your life worth to live the way you want to do so
Show your availability by coming to this church for prayers
and  I will show you my ability through my precepts my son
Always, have a kind word for those who needs help
Always, give your heart for those who loves me
Always, make others to understand my strength and power
Always, have a hearty appetite to follow my steps my son
Today is your wedding day and its the most happiest day for you
Let the rest of your life be the best of life with my blessings
Walk with me my son I will clear all those rough path ways
and I will make you to reach a life without falling into any sins
