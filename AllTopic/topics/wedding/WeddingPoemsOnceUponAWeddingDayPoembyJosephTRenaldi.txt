Once upon a wedding day
A couple joined in a close association
with hopes of love and good fortune to stay
That brought a state of euphoria to them
In every distinguished way.
Once upon a wedding day
the memories of their courtship
Glowed warmly in their heart
Where care and cultivated affection
Ever played a fundamental part.
Once upon a wedding day
The marriage ceremony was extra special
With the wedding march stately and slow
And the procession seemed to sparkle
And brought forth an attractive glow.
Once upon a wedding day
The marriage ceremony and festivities,
The cards and gifts and flowers
Filled this day with cheerfulness
And many lovely and happy hours.
Once upon a wedding day
Those that they loved surrounded them
To share their happiness this day
Bestowing their blessings of the marriage
And for their nuptial vows to forever stay.
