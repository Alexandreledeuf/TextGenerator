Beauty brightens the wedding day
with purity of conduct at bay,
And innocence lies dormant now
marked by uncertainty on the brow.
A wedding, like a bell doth ring,
Attached to the heart with a string,
And ecstasy, dawning the eyes,
Reflects the marvel of the skies.
The vows taken on a wedding day by far,
like the sanctity of life and character are,
And the animation in the eyes more bright
than the moonlight on a tranquil night.
