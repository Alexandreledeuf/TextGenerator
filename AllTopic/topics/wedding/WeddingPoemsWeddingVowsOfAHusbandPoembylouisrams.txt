i will love, cherish, and take care of you
all the days of my life.
for you have consented to be my wife.
i will honor and respect all your
beliefs and thoughts, for which you stood and fought.
you did not let anything distract or sway you
from your beliefs, which gave me a sense of relief.
because if anyone was able to sway you
in your younger years, we would not
find happiness and cheer.
you are strong, just like me
and you captured my heart and set me free.
and now that we are united as one
under the eyes of GOD.
i vow that we will never part.
and this will be the beginning
of our brand new start.
