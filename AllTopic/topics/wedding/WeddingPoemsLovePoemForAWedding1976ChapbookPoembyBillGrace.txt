I love:
The tides that ebb and flow
And marbled lights on broken roads
The warmth of poetry within
Evening caress that transcends sin.
I love:
The birds that were duped by an early thaw
To mid-winter song, and wonder -
If they were so very wrong?
I ask you to take this ageing ring of gold
Companion touchstone of a first communion
And to hold its trust as we will mold
What God shall join for evermore.
