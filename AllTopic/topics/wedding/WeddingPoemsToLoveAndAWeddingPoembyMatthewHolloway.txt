To love and a wedding
~
I share in the joy of my friends
While the air is filled with songs
To love, to love and a wedding
Blessed are the lives of friends
I share in their smiles quite often
For their humour is a narcotic
It infiltrates almost every thought
Induces many a joyful memory
In an addictive fashion I realise
The excited talk and anticipation
To love, to love and a wedding
Is something private shared
An intimate union of two
Shared with those close and loved
The glasses raised in celebration
The smiles and the laughter
What joy it has been to share
In the joy of my friends
Who sing of love and the song
To love, to love and a wedding
