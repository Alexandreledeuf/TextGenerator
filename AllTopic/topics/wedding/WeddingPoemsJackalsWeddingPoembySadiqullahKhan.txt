The small dust particle
Is like an atom
Revolves on its centre
The light coming through the window
Gives it visibility
The drops of rain were falling
Splashing on earth
Leaving behind lightening thunders
We had heard in childhood
The rain drops so falling
Is the jackal's wedding
The celebration
Though deep in the heart
And around is the circle
Of the singing girls
And playing children
