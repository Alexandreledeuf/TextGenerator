Imprisoned in squalor, like a rat in a cage
A hopeless ignition explodes into rage
Poverty's chains cut with mocking intent
Desensitized humans with anger to vent
To offer a dream, but a nightmare provide
To build up hope then strip away pride
To trample the weak into the dust
Is to set a foundation for greed and lust
The rat is a fighter, the worm always turns
Where once there was apathy, pride now returns
The lesser will rise with fear as their friend
From the sewer of life you can only ascend
To offer no dream, and nowhere to run
To Build up hope in the form of a gun
To trample the good and the decent within
Is to set up a struggle that no one can win
Man is a lover and killer entwined
To be an extreme is to conquer the blind
Where one man falls another now stands
Ready for death with blood on his hands
