Las Vegas, Las Vegas, the city of dreams,
The city of triumph and utter disaster.
For you can win and gain a most vast amount,
But you can also loose without a count.
I advise you my friend, to watch yourself
With the up most of care and thought.
Stay away from the one arm bandits
And be careful of the thieves and
Hustlers which rob you in vain.
Stroll the streets for a meal which is cheap,
But I am sure sure that the food will be
Cut back, for then you will have more money
To play Black Jack.
I know that you cannot resist the temptation
Of having a bit of a gamble, but in order
To not appear like a spanner, be sure
To place your wages in a casual manner.
I am sure that the gambling will carry on
Throughout the dead of night, and no
one will stop your addiction, not even
Your wife!
So you are flat-broke and you are on your
Flight home, at least you have enjoyed
your time, but remember my friend, Las
Vegas is an ultimate unknown; for
It is the city of triumph and utter
Disaster.
