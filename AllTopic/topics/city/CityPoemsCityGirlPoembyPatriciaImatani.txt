Once, there was a girl,
She lived in the city.
She is precious like a pearl,
She grew up to be smart and witty.
She was always happy,
She was sometimes, sad.
She was always laughing,
Her laugh was bad. XD
She loves to study,
She loves to write.
She loved to dress oddly,
She loved to dress in white.
These are some of the things,
The things about her I can see.
Of course, I can see them,
Cause this girl is me.
