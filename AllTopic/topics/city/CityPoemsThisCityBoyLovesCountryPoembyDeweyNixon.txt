You can rock to Elvis Presley,
You can Jam to ZZ top, you can bop
To Carl Perkins, you can dance to
Credence and rock. But when it comes
To music this city boy loves country.
You can make love to the platters,
You can croon with Franky boy.
You can shake with little Richard,
Or sing the blues with Benny King.
But when it comes to music,
This city boy loves country.
You can cry to Barbara Streisand,
You can laugh to Roger Miller,
You can go way back with Jolson
Or keep up with M.T.V.
But when it comes to music
This city boy loves country.
