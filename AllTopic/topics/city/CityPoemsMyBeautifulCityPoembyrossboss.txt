You are my city
the gaudy glow of neon light
that dispels the darkness of the night
Enhailing this dust flying smells ands feels like home
the cloudy weather, the dim trees, the city looked like and open book.
with nature bringing a colourful beauty to ones heart
Alone i lay on a wooden raft
my breath is void of oxygen
my heart is scribbled without rythm
to the beautiful change made by ur smiling culture
The shimmers of the moon made the rest of the city glimmer
now its clear why ure a symbol of pride
The lullaby tunes of the mocking bird awakenes momments of passion
My head speaks and so does my heart
am lost in the beautiful city and for ever i want to be
Here, laughter is a pleasant sound
it spreads joy all around
flushing out every despairs of the heart
Just for this city
i will open my eyes and ask the creator for one more day
this are my praises 4 the city in u.
