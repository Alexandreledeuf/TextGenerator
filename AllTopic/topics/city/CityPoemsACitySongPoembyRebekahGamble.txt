There’s a constant rumble
To the pounding beat
Of the people’s hearts
As the rhythm of the street.
There's a constant rhythm
In the rolling of their feet.
There’s a constant thunder
To the dancing on the street.
There’s a roaring tide
In the people that I meet.
There’s a constant tremble
Of marching on the street.
There’s a blast of soul
Of the music on the street.
There’s a newborn rhythm
Of humanities' heat.
It’s the constant shouting,
And the constant heat,
It’s life’s own anthem
In the raging of the street.
There’s a constant rumble
Of people’s rolling feet.
There’s a constant thumping
Of the streets' heart beat.
There’s a new soul’s rhythm
Of the angles and the heat
Of the people and the buildings
Being the rhythm of the street.
It’s an ancient hold,
It’s a new world beat.
It’s the never-ending rhythm
Of the singing of the street.
