Modeled after the gardens and parks of Paris and London, New York City's Central Park was the country's first landscaped public park when it opened in 1859. A welcome breather from the bustling, crowded city streets, the 843-acre park is home to a zoo, boathouse, carousel, outdoor theater, wildlife sanctuary, and two ice-skating rinksâ€”all among picturesque fountains, bridges, statues, and ponds. Get active and go climbing on the schist boulders throughout the park; jog, bike, or rollerblade along six-mile Park Drive; or get a game going at the tennis courts, basketball courts, or baseball fields.
