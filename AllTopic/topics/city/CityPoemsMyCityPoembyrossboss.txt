You are my city
The gaudy glow of neon light
that dispels the darkness of the night
Enhaling the smell of dust makes it feel like home
The cloudy weather, the dim trees, you look like an open book.
with nature bringing a colourful beauty to ones' heart
Alone i lay on a wooden raft
My breath is void of oxygen
My heart is scrambled without rythm
to the beautiful change made by ur smiling culture
The shimmers of the moon made the rest of the city glimmer
Now its clear why ure a symbol of pride
The lullaby tunes of the mocking bird awakens moments of passion
My head speaks and so does my heart
am lost in this beautiful city and for ever i want 2 b
Here, laughter is a pleasant sound
It spreads joy all around
flushing out every despair of the heart
Just for this city
i will open my eyes and ask the creator for one more day
one more day to discover the city in you and you in the city
let this be my praise of you, my beautiful city
