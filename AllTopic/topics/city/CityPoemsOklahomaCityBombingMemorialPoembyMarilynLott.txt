We couldn’t believe what we were hearing
It just couldn’t be true we thought
How could anyone be this cruel?
We hoped they would quickly be caught
A bombing of the worse kind had occurred
It just didn’t seem real or seem fair
Could there be a mistake we asked
Could it have really happened there?
But it was true, we soon discovered
It was announced all over the world
Pain and suffering, the loss of life
Anger of a huge magnitude was hurled
And so on April nineteenth of each year
We honor the loss of precious lives
It’s still so difficult to imagine
And the pain still cuts like a knife
The memorial defines each person
Who lost their life in vain
For family and friends alike
Would give anything to see them again
So let’s all close our eyes for a moment
Pray for those who are hurting still
Hope that the hurt will someday subside
And the ache inside them will heal!
