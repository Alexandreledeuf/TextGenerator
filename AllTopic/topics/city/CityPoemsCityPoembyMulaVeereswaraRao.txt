City
Plastic flowers
Lipstick lovers
Replica races,
Lip service glitters!
City is a ‘concrete’ jungle
Where mass will not mingle!
City is so selfish
you will be like fish without water
City always runs for money
Never finds time to enjoy nature’s honey
City fixes price on every thing
Crux is to make profit on every thing.
City is cultural interference
City’s life is social indifference
It’s pity
Village trying to imitate city
This is my final inference
