. . .telling those who swarm around him his desire
is that an appendage from each of them
fill, invade each of his orifices,--
repeating, chanting
Oh yeahOh yeahOh yeahOh yeahOh yeah
until, as if in darkness he craved the sun, at last he reached
consummation.
Until telling those who swarm around him begins again
(we are the wheel to which we are bound).
