Love to love,
Love to be loved.
Love a person,
Love a person inside and out.
To judge is to hurt,
To hurt is to not love.
Not to love is not to love yourself,
Not to love yourself is not to love other.
Not to love other is not to recieve love,
Not to recieve love hurts
Everyone in the end.
