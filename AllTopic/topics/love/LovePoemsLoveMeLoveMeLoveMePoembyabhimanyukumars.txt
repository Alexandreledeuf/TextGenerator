Love me, love me, love me
White says love me
Never, Ever, Never
My heart say nevermore.
White gives peace
White gave me pollution
White sowed purity
White spoiled my chastity.
White is superior
It made me inferior
White is cultured
It destroyed my culture.
White is all
Who said this all
You, its only you
Not I, never will I.
White says love me
I say I don't
White asks why I wont
Because you ruled at my own.
