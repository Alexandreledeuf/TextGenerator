I Love You
I Love Love You
no other words could say it more
your handsome and clever
without you I'd be sore
I Love You
I Love Love You
nothing else can say
your charming and loving
your the sunshine on my rainy day.
I Love You
I Love Love You
you mean so much to me
your bright blue eyes and smiling face
I hope my love you see
I Love You
I Love Love You
there are no other words that describe
when you put your arms around me
I always want you by my side
I Love Love you
