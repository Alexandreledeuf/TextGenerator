Beware, my Love
Of the thunder
That we will encounter
When we touch
Beware, my love
Of the Rain
The outpourings of the pain
For the lost time
Beware, my love
Of the lightning
The resurrection that it will bring
Of our dormant desires
Beware, my Love
Of the flood
The mingling of our blood
When our skins dissolve
Beware, my Love
Of the reverbration
The resounding celebration
Of Our eternal Embrace
