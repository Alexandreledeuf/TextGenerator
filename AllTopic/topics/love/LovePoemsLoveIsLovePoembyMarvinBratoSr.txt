I can not fathom, the reasons
nor understand the significance
why does love just blossoms
in the garden of the heart's stance
and grows abundantly
at any given chance
Love I suppose, is freedom
of the heart and soul
It exists to sooth boredom
and brings zest to all
No matter what it does
Its nativity is a call
For love is love
Boundless and true
