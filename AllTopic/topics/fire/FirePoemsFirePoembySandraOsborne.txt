The flame crackles,
Spitting shinning sparks
And ashes and fire
Into the warming air.
It’s always fighting,
It’s Always changing,
Seems always so close
To life.
To it’s burning,
But beyond it’s brilliance
The fire defies, denies
And defeats it’s death.
Patience, I believe,
Is learned in the view.
Because with strength and defiance,
The coals burn anew.
