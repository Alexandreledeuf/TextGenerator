Fire, fire

Nature has turned cruel
nothing is going well
there is a forest fire
and everything is on fire
it is destroying
everything that is falling on the way
houses, animals, and forestry
the curse has befallen from an almighty
we are devastated
nothing is rested
everything is burnt
we need to bear the brunt
here shall stop it?
we face worst
God save the country
save the people and everybody
Hasmukh Amathalal Mehta
