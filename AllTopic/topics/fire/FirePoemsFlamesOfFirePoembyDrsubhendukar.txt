As I am honored with grace impassionate
that dazzles in me and my innate grin
glamoured by setting rays in the sky
along the white clouds as cohered.
that boost me up like waves
in the sea with all its blues
when being cuddled in the spring
the lap of tranquil as in moon.
when the clouds moves apart above
it is the sun yet steeped in blood
promising of the love as prologued
as twilight descends slowly
i do remember the thrills of passion
as revered by  the bliss of love
when reckoning to the flames of fire.
