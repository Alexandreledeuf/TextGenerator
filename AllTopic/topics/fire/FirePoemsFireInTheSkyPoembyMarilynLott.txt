Like fire in the sky it is
When the sun sets in the night
Red and yellow engulf the world
In a vivid and glorious sight
It’s seems so unexplainable
How the sky lights up this way
I can’t think of a more perfect
Way to end the day
Sometimes purple adds itself
To the colors up above
A fever in the sky it seems
Or God showing His thoughtful love
Whatever is the reason
We enjoy the sights so much
When the sun drops from the sky
And leaves its brilliant touch!
