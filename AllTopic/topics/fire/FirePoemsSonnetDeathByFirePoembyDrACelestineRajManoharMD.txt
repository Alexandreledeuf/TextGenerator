What gory deaths by fire, we see today!
Gone is ‘sati’ but brides burn still by stove;
In accidents too, people die this way;
Self-immolate, some people out of love!
Air-crash victims get burnt like wood and hay;
Bomb-blasts produces smell of burning flesh;
Bus burns with men in pugilistic way!
And nuclear accidents too happen fresh.
A cracker-unit burns its children down;
A Temple-fire engulfs so many souls;
Some men are dowsed, lit live in a big town;
Fire-extinguishers have but scarcer roles.
’Tis strange to see why people burn alive!
What kind of pleasure, Satans such derive?
