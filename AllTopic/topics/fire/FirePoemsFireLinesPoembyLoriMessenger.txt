Turning you hold your arms up
My eyes touch where you turn
The shouts from the fire line crew
And the collapsing column of smoke
The shape of your look
As you turn again
Nearly trapped by the fire
Overrunning the west side road
We run the escape route
I hold your face to me
Always where you are
