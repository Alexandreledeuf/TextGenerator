Embers turning deep crimson red
Streaking through the hardened wood
Ashes fallen to the ground
The world silent not a sound
Smoke rising to the sky
Gentle breezes blowing by
Stars twinkling in the night
The moon so full and so bright
Midnight sky shaded with streaks of indigo
Pondering on the colors as if I were Van Gough
Serene solemn night
Sitting by the fireâ€™s light
Wishing you were here by my side
And then.. Perhaps my deep feelings for you I would not have to hide
