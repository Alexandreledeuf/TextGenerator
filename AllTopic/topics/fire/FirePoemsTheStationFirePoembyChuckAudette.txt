late, on the way home
I saw the engines
the rescues and police
and wondered why
the Station Nightclub last night
a rock concert
with pyrotechnics naturally
all caught on video
as the walls and ceilings flamed
and an orderly exit
becomes desperate under the unreal advance of the flames
suddenly a panicked crush to escape
the darkening interior of hell
the heat and toxic smoke
I can't imagine
the helpless entrapment amongst tightly-packed bodies
immobile and hurt
feeling the flames coming closer
like a hungry demonic beast
dripping saliva of burning plastic
coming to devour its prey
screams of those being taken
hoping to be unconscious
to block out this nightmare
and when it came for me
to already be in a cool place

May we remember them always.
