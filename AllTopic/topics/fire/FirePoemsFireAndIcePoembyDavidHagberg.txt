We come into this world with nothing and we depart with nothing. You departed with nothing. Yet you took everything.
There was something omnious about that night, something gloomy, something fateful. Maybe it was the wind and the rain. Maybe just a feeling. I suppose a fitting night to leave this world as we all eventually must. With nothing. Our final flight wont be delayed.
Why you had to leave I do not know. I do not understand. Maybe it is not for me to know, not for me to understand.
You where fire. I was ice. You melted me. I soothed you.
Alas, a burning soul will always leave this world in flames, as was your fate. Myself?  I returned to my cold home in the north where ice belongs, with nothing.
Nothing.
