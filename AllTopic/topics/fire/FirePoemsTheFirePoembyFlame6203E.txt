the fire,
i love it,
the way it dances,
out of control leaping,
into the air it's,
so beautiful,
the way it dances,
the way the sparks,
fly up high and,
the flame shows me,
the past,
the future,
and what might have been,
the cracking of a,
new twig in the fire,
the jumping,
the dancing,
the leaping,
the uncontrollable flame,
when it dies,
so does my spirit.
