Tell me which fight do you fight deep in you
My body shakes in waves of pain you feel
I see your fear is too dark to look through
No moon can help when I want you to heal
I say no words for fear that they can’t help
While seeds on fire burn the future wood
Though all I wish for is to make walls melt
While cries in silence doubt what I found good
Please trust me for just that I just trust you
Please fight the fear and show to me your face
There is this world but you and I are too
Don't be a rose hidén behind a vase
Oh please be brave to speak to me now true
Whatever happens I will still love you
