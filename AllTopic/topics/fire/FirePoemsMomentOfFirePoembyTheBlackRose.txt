Heavens on fire as the last day burns out the sky,
Setting the world with an eerie orange glow,
Streaked through with pinks and reds,
Stealing the breath of those below,
I wish i could steal your breath in another way,
Passion,
Lust,
Desire,
driving me on,
on to the moment...
You can feel it,
tingle in your lips,
to your fingers,
down to your toes,
Electric like your bodys never known,
If i touched you now,
I could see it,
Leap between skin,
Hand on your shoulder,
my breath in your ear,
the fire is in me,
a romantic desire that ill never let die,
The question is,
with the air alight,
& the moment forever close,
What do you Desire?
