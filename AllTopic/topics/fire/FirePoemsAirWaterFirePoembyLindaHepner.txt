The Milky Way was curled and curdled in the sky tonight
when on the shore I heard the waves crash down;
a thousand cats leaped miowling at the moon,
wolves howled at the wind
and in the forest a nightingale sang till dawn.
Mañana tocaran los guitaros
de mi corazón
y cantaran los vientos
and strangest drums will thrum
while Miriam will undulate and set her cymbals
trembling with prophesies, crying
Wa habibi, what has befallen you?
Oh where shall I find you?
I found you coming towards me….
Mi amor, my best beloved
come intertwine, unite and fling
your robes upon the sea shore
where waves will bear them to far islands,
your jewels will shoot like meteors into the oceans
and flying fish will leap out shooting to the heavens…
may all our passion reign in glorious confusion
while in the forest
a nightingale will sing one song till dawn.
