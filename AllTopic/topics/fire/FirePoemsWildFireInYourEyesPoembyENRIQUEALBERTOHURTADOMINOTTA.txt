The wild flame of your lovely green eyes
has still not been extinguished, my love,
has still not been extinguished!
In nights without stars, they glisten as two Venuses
in the immensity of the night, lighting my destiny.
Although, with the implacable passing of time,
the brightness of the fire of your lovely green eyes
became tinged with sadness, and the wild thing became fondness,
they still smile with sweetness every time they meet with mine.
My love, the wild fire of your pretty green eyes
still warms my heartbroken being in cold mornings,
when the morning nostalgia rides hopelessly,
looking for restless souls like mine.
My love, the wild fire of your beautiful green eyes,
a long time ago they found, by chance,
the hidden fire of my sad, sad eyes,
and they melted it in love fire for an eternity.
The wild fire of your lovely green eyes
has still not been extinguished, my love,
has still not been extinguished!
