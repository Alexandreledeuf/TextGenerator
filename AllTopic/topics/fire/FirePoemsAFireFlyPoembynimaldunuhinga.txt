The man was sentenced to death
jury was agreed and the magistrate already signed.
He was an innocent criminal and a scapegoat
but no options.
The true criminal with the Lords
and the Law is imbalanced.
One night in the prison cell
he saw a fire-fly like an ambulance
and he scribbled on the wall.
'Tomorrow morning a prince comes
to take me away, a better world,
my little fire-fly you try to show me the way
and I see that real world from your faint light.
Thank you so much my dear
now only I realized that I was in the total darkness
beneath the sun and moon.'
Welcome to our world my dear friend Denis.Joe
