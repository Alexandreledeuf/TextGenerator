Since the day that the lord set me on fire
i have had a desire to acquire the knowledge of my messiah,
Whatever u desire, Dont retire
Aspire to Acquire the desire u admire
If u perspire
u wont retire.
When the enemies conspire to fire your desire,
dont tire,
remember your mesiah
the one who speaks fire
He has clothed you with his attire,
and has given you his entire empire,
that if you refire you will acquire,
this is not time to expire,
With Jesus your mesiah,
the devil's fire will backfire,
Desire the holyfire,
Become a carrier of the holyghost fire,
Our God the unmpire will never retire
He will always refire, he will never expire,
he will always inquire
his power is forever,
So u have all u require my friend,
to acquire your long admired desire,
this is all u require,
stay on fire.
