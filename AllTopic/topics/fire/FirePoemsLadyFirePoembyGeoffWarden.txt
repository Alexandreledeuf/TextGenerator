'Tis a fine Lady..,
I was connected too
Her words of poetry
Cut me right through
'Tis the Lady I chance
Cross a very thin line
Her sway of romance
melts my frozen heart..
Somehow, someway I am drawn to verse
It pulls me closer
absorbing my very soul
consuming my very being
Strangers...
though her words taught my mind
with an unspeakable desire..
for her golden hand I wish to hold
She is the ink
I long to be the paper
Oh write your words of passion
Upon my needing heart........
A fine Lady full of passion
Fulfilling the needs of my want
Ink meets paper, my world a fire
She..the Lady...Fills my desire..
Such Princess of passionate dream
Golden hand upon my cheek
such sweet gentle touch
Makes my soul so speak.....
