every day they feed the fire
the fire inside of me
that will burn my soul
and i will die
b/c they fed the fire
they call me names
mock me
and worse of all
make fun of my freinds
when they do this
the fire grows
burning my insides
starting with my toes
it gets bigger
then goes to my liver stomoch and lungs
then finally my heart
then im gone
some will cry and feel bad
some will laugh and say im psycho
the ones that laugh
will move on
and build a fire
an kill someone else
