It was so fulminating.
A fire burned within
from spindly kindling
and a breath of air
it sprang to life
consuming obstacles
and dull objections
and stark conventions.
Iit jumped all gaps
yet was not seen
by those who could
and bravely would
rise in defence
in bold offence.
So unexpected,
not wished for even,
it took on quickly
and without mercy
a life of egotistic
and autonomic
well, somewhat comic
and drooling presence.
So unprepared
so stunned and scared
yet breathing in
this deadly fragrance
and longing for
the nectar of
a soul ordained
for me alone
and nought is left
to say or do
we were as such
simply because
we had to be
it was a law
of nature
one which can not
be broken
by mere humans.
A fire burns
so cleanly when
the darkness
of our doubts
is absent.
And as I float
in saddened waves
of smoke and seek
those mirrors
which could give,
perhaps be saviours
for answers
from my soul
and heart
my tortured mind
does not perceive
what she must know,
perhaps relieved
and rescued in
the nick of love
from devastation.
I miss you so
my heartease flower
but hope you will
not hear those words
or feel the heat
or smell the smoke.
And if you see
a distant fire
be not alarmed
the smoke has gone.
