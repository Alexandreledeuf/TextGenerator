Quite is the fire, quite is the dreams,
quite is the passions, the laughter and the tears,
Quite is the fire that sooths the moment.
Quite is the fire it's like a snow bird in flight,
lie still, lie still and take in the moment.
For we shall remember how to dream, it's like watching a
quite fire.
For a quite fire is like timeless echos in the winds.
A quite fire can soothe a lonely soul in passing.
quite is the fire.
A quite fire can take you over in a moment, it's magic,
A quite fire can burn deep with in your soul for hope,
for peace and for love.
Quite is the fire to hear a silent whisper and think of love.
Quite is the fire.
Quite is the moment
Quite is the time for laughter
Quite is the time for hope
Quite is the time for passion
A quite fire is like timeless echos in the winds.
