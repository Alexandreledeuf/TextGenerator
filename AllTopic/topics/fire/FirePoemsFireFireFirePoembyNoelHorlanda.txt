Pyro, Fuego, Fire,
Itâ€™s a power, a strength,
A source of light,
Luminescent as solar energy,
Incandescent as moonbeams,
Luminosity of stars
Effulgence of blue heavens
It kindles, ignites vivid minds,
Imaginations, carnival brilliance,
Illuminates the world, the universe,
In the beginning a friend,
It leads, guides your way,
Makes you  warm, live, survive, yet
In the end, if abuse, left alone,
Becomes a monster, a destroyer,
Murderer, a spoiler it is,
Instill fear in you, the phobia overrule us,
Soon the cosmos, the macrocosm,
Solar, lunar, mankind to ashes,
Lustrous existence gone,
All in darkness, inky black
Empty space, serenity, tranquility but then,
The essence is nothing without -
Fire! Fire! Fire!
