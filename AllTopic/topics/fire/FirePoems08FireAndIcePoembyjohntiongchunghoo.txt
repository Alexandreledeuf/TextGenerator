fire
passion
ice
estrangement
ying
the cold
yang
warmth
sun
cheerfulness
moon
melancholy reigns
between she and him
a lane
each agrees
to walk negotiating
fire and ice
ying,  yang
sun, moon
both knowing
that the human world
has evolved
in between these opposites
and in between
they would survive
and grow, procreate
