Fire, fire,
Fire, fight with the fire.
I am fire
You are fire,
Fight with the fire
And take care.
Fire harbor doubts
Fire hamper growth,
Fire is my illness,
Fire is sap my
Life force and wisdom.
Fire, fire,
Fire is both inside
And fire is also outside.
Fire is my own doubts,
My own uncertainty
And my own confusion.
Let me overtake my fire,
Let me fight with this fire
Within first.
