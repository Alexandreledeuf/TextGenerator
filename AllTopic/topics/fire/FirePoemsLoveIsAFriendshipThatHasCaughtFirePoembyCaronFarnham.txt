It appears as a quiet understanding
trust, sharing and forgiving
Love remains loyal through good and bad
it settles for less than perfection
and makes allowances for human weakness
Love feels content with the present
it hopes for the future
it doesn't brood over the past
Love includes the day in day of chronicle
of irrations, problems and compromises
the small disappointmets, big victories and common goals
If you have love in your life
it can make up for a great many things you be
If you don't have it
no matter what else you have
it never feels enough.
