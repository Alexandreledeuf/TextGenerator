Embers light the fire
Brake down the bark
Fueling heart and desire
Lost from the start
Oh, but I love being lost with you
I'd say the fire lights up my life
but I don't have to
because I think you feel it too
I just want to stay here
and be warm
Right next to you
Made it passed the wire
Painted like art
Keep on rolling like a tire
You have my heart
and the blood is swirling so beautifully
I thought you'd like to hear
My every thought and word
The only problem is
It's summed up in three simple words
I love you
Singing with the choir
Never to part
You're the one I admire
Fire was the spark
and now my world is lit up so beautifully.
