How long will this go on?
Consumed daily by this passionate fire
...the way I tempt fate
tease the flame closer to my eager skin
I have taken this nameless obsession
and set it  to music
For each year that has passed
when my heart remained frozen
I have taken a vow
dedicating myself to the thawing
I feel, touch, taste each exquisite moment
Whether stolen or given as a gift
Mine now, to wrap in black velvet
keep as a treasure
One by one, I lit the candles
watched them burn
Blue, for my soul in turmoil
Red, for my one true love
Black, for that place unspoken
White....
I save for you alone
Although logic and history dispute this:
we will light it together on the darkest night
illuminate eachothers shadow
at the alter of my desire
