At that moment in time, the point of no return
You’re standing inside the fire watching yourself burn
You don't feel the pain as you stand comfortably numb
Watching your life unfold, watching it come undone
You’re caught in the fire as you break down and cry
Watching your life fade as you wave it goodbye
You touch the fire but it freezes you, you want the feeling back
Watching the smoke fill your eyes as it turns to a void of black
You'll do anything, whatever it takes not to fade away
Anything instead of watching your life burn everyday
You'll do anything to stop your heart from turning to dust
Anything to stop your tears creating a life turned to rust
You need to find that once bright encompassing spark
The reason that will pull you into the light and out of the dark
Words of wisdom can save you, if only you can be told
You need to hide from the flames and run from the cold
You no longer want to wave your life a tearful goodbye
You no longer wish to stand inside the fire and cry
At that moment in time, the point of no return
You no longer wish to watch yourself burn
