I carry pride like a disease, you know I'm Stubborn
and I'm longing to be close!
I fell desperate without vision,
you wrap around me like a winter Coat.
you've come and burned me with a kiss
and my heart for you! Every single breath you search
much deeper within my through the way things appear!
You looking up to my heart.
We share dream's
we join the Angels in Celebration
and by faith we speak revival, give us an open heaven
and anoint our prayers this day revive our heart.
Light your fire on Us! that's our request today!
