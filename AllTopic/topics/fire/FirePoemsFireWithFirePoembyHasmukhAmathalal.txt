Motto and craze
'fire with fire' is no answer
You need to sprinkle water
Get all the options to stop destruction
It shall put off immediately with timely prevention
It is mere an example
Faced by all people
Fire may be raging in our mind
But solution is only an answer to find
Not force with force
Or action with reaction
But response with calmness
And smile always on face
This can create different situation
Peace shall find its continuation
Love shall rule and hate shall disappear
People may have no fear
We are all human brings
And can bring
Situation to normal stage
This should be our motto and craze
