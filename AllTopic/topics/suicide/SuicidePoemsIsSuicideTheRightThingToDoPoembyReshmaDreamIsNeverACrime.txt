When you feel there is no one to care for you
When you feel that you are all alone in this world
When you feel that you are useless
When you fell that you are a nuisance
When you feel that life itself has turned into a waste
When you feel that no one wants you anymore
When you feel that success is a dream that 'll never come true
When you decide to call in death yourself
Please understand
You are doing the biggest sin of all
Life can never turn itself into a waste
Its YOU who make it useless
Men who have been successful
Have always thought positive
Negative thoughts can never help you
You very well know that
God himself has created you
He has worked hard to bring in life in you
To make you breathe. see, walk, hear and talk
It all has a purpose
And if you call in your guest before that
Its the biggest sin you do
No one is alone
There is always someone
Who stays with you every time, everywhere
And when you reach success,
He reveals himself
Surprising you
Don't you want to see who that is?
Then work harder
You are the most needed
Every little dropp is needed
To make a mighty ocean
So do not call in death yourself
You have no right to do so
Only the creator as the right
To destroy his creation
Besides, knowingly leaving behind the ones who loved you
In vain
Shall increase your sins even more
SUICIDE is NEVER a RIGHT thing to do........................
