should my heart stop beating
i want you to know
i love you all
and just can't let go
it's pushing me down
the things that i see
my mind should be free
im trapped with no hope
i don't know how i cope
you know why i write this letter
we all know it isn't gonna get better
day by day
i have to say
my last goodbye
this is no lie
tomorrow its will be done
don't try to run
face the truth with staring eyes
because now i've said my last goodbyes
tomorrow i end the pain
it is the end of the lane
goodbye my dear
