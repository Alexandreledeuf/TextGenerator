Thick black lines with heavens
embrace
It's hard to tell its hell I
face
Condemed to die a sinners
love
A conceiled tear from someone
above
One slice of anger out flew
fear
Secretly killing the one held so
near
Last white linen covered the
stain
But couldn't mask this child's hidden
pain
