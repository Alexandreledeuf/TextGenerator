my days are dreary, dark, and grey
i want to scream,
im being surrounded by all the people
they're calling me names like freak, and emo
they call me emo all because,
they saw my wrists, it was enough
to make them judge
all because im different,
i didn't want to fit in.
they judge me by what they see
they don't know enough to see
whats inside is what really matters
whats behind this upside down smile
a girl screaming, drowning in tears
because the peoples judgements
were her worst fears.
now its over i go home and get in trouble
im late and sent to my room
they all assume im safe, up in my room,
but they walk in it's permanantly over
im on the floor, my arms are covered
in blood of red,
im dead forever!
