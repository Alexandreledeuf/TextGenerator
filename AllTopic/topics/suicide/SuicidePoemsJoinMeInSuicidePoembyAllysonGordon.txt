Where the sun sets and the moon rises,
I will meet you there at night fall
To create pandemonium one last time
But tonight will never be forgotten
For tonight we seal our deaths,
Together eternally we will be free
We climb the mountain and enter the forest
To find a place where the moon shines brightly
We leave an enthralling elegy for our loved ones
Say our goodbyes to all we will not miss
Brace ourselves for what’s about to come
We join hands and take the leap of faith…
