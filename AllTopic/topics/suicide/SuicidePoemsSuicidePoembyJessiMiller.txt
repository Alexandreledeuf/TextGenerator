Twas the hour before my suicide
Sitting in my room holding a knife
Thinking of family and friends
Contemplating my life
I thought of hanging
But as the knife came closer to my throat
I knew it was quicker
I quickly wrote my farewell note
Nothing was or went right
Anything that could go wrong did
I am often depressed
People treat me like alittle kid
This maybe easy way out
But I don't care
Does anybody love me? I don't know
People seem to hate me everywhere
