Given too freely
this can become ammunition
a weapon used against you
like a suicide bomber
in your soul.
Never given
this can become isolating
as you will only trust yourself
and have nowhere to turn
during the darkest days
which are gauranteed to come.
Once broken
this can very rarely be repaired
to it's original state
of pure and honest sincerity
always having a doubt in the corner
resurfacing it's ugliness
just when you need it the most.
Truly appreciated
this can be the greatest gift
you will ever give
or receive.
Once it's yours cherish it
as you would a treasure
that you may never have again.
Trust is a very delicate creature.
