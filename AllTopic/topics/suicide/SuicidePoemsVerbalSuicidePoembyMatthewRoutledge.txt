i have been chained to anchors
i have been tortured in my mind
i have been gaged and stopped from talking
i have been forced to stop believing
the world has strange ways
of expressing how we feel
in some ways it is joyul peace
in others it is cerebrale death
verbal suicide
is all we have
just give up
and take the final hand
as it reaches down
grab with all your might
silence is not agreement
it just starts the fight
