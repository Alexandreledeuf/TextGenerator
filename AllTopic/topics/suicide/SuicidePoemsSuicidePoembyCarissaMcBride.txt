please let me die
im so tired.
i hate it here
i want to die.
he dosen't love me.
he loves noone.
he makes my heart cry.
i want  to commit suicide,
but i can't decide how
a guns so messy.
but my wrist im used to.
i want to watch my blood spill on the floor.
as i feel the life leaving my body.
i feel the urge strenghtining
i now must say
goodbye
