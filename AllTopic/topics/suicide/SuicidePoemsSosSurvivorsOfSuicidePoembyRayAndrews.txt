Our daughter was lovely and twenty one
White things a portent for hope
But-She took the dark side, not the light side
And left on the end of a rope
She'd given us all sign after sign
We fought till' we could no more
We became resigned and waited it out
Till' she walked through death's door
We had little voice
She made her choice
A lesson: people will do what they will
Riding a mean ocean of grief
Our despair beyond belief
We knuckled down and stayed the course
And tried to move on with our lives
Troughs sticking daggers
Your broken heart staggers
Four or five years at sea
Adrift in the storm
No lighthouse formed
Trying to steer through the fog
Pain to abound
It ran us to ground
And smashed our heads
With it's heels
A horrific force
While running it's course
It flayed us down to the bone
With two ministers pointing
The way up above
We were able to find
Spirit that loved
With welcoming hand
HE gestured to land
And said 'Come, follow me'
Without bell's chime
There followed a time
When dark clouds pulled away
And we coursed out into the light
New lights came on
A new born dawn
We found
A new life that's right
