Maybe I can stab myself?
No, hurts to much.
Maybe I can shoot myself?
No, don't have a gun.
Maybe I can drown myself?
No, to easy to be revived.
Maybe I can jump?
No, don't want to be paralyzed.
Maybe I can overdose?
Yes, there are plenty of pills in the world and is almost virtually painless if it works.
Suicide is not easy but if you really want to die, you will brave the instant pain just for eternal pain relief.
