It was just a bomb that took four arms and six legs
From nine perfectly healthy individuals
It was just a bomb that took sixteen lives
And left seventy two people seriously wounded
It was just a bomb that stole the parents
And grandparents and uncles and aunts
Not to mention the children….
All of whose lives had been cut short by years
When a second bomb exploded
As they stood by and weeped in disbelief
The dead and the dying left lying on the charred ground
Of what once had been a busy city street full of life
It was just a bomb
But it took a coward to detonate
