I need pain
a knife against my wrist
is not enough
well it's pain,
but i need stronger pain
Pain that will make me scream
I need to see blood
to smell and taste it
I need the feeling of my blood
draining from my veins
I grab a knife and in a moment
all around me
my blood is flowing
I see flashing lights
hear shouts and screams
but I am afraid
they are to late
They rush me to the hospital
but there is nothing they can do
the cut on my neck is to deep
they cannot save me
My parents are planning my funeral
their actions slow and sad
my sister is crying along with my friends
they did not expect it
I showed no signs
at my funeral people are crying all around me
but now it is time for my sister to speak
the first thing she says is
'I can't believe she was suicidal................'
