I'm thinking of killing myself
and just want to tell someone
my parents never listen
never let me have any fun
I don't have any friends
the kids at school pick on me
with all their little cliques
calling me fat and ugly
operator
yes, yes I understand
it's a story that's often told
can you stay on the line
I need to put you on hold
I'm sorry but I just have to
there's a call I need to answer
a ten year old wants to die
he's been diagnosed with cancer
then there's a woman
who wants to end it all
her ex boyfriend raped her
then broke her jaw
next, I have a couple
who had a son die in Iraq
they no longer want to live
since he's not coming back
oh and did I forget to mention
the others at the end of their rope
seems like the whole world is calling
even, faith, love and hope
