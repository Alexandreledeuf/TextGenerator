Alone without a cause.
Alone with no life.
Trying to kill her spirit
That is beginning to die inside.
Alone in her Hell.
Alone in her abyss.
Attempting to end her being
As it pours from her wrists.
Alone without a chance.
Alone with no hope.
Watching the stained blade
As she frees her soul.
Alone in the air.
Alone as she drifts.
Slicing so she can escape
The nightmare's images.
Alone with no will.
Alone with no dreams.
Suicide killing her thoughts,
Silencing her heart's beats.
