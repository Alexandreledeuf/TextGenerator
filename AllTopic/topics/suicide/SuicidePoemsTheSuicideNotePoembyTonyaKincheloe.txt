I can't be what everyone wants me to be.
Everything I do is just another mistake.
Ican't make anyone happy or proud.
I only make them mad and dissappointed.
I understand that everyone hates me.
I understand no one will cry.
I know im not loved.
I don't know how to love.
And now I never will.
I just wish..................
