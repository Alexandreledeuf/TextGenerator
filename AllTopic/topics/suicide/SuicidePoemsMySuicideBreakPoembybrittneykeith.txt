I wish it was all over
it would all just end
let life just take over
Life just take
all the pain away
just end all the hurt
I tell myself to
take the pills
my body listens
i fall to the floor
lay there lifeless
not breathing or moving
but nope that didnt work
so i take a blade
to my wrist
the blood flows
like a river down my arm
finally i lay there lifeless
yet again.
not to ever wake up again
to burn in the firey pits of hell.
i went aginst god.
but i was just to numb
to listen to him
but im better off
so is everyone else
