This is you...
You're causing me to bleed.
And you have no apologies
For whom you inflict fear into.
Seeing what isn't here.
I'm begging you to leave.
Can't you see I'm on my knees?
I've tried and tried so many times.
But you're still here...
Making me bleed...
All over the linoleum...
Thank God it's easy to clean.
Take this pain away from me
'Cause this Novacaine
Doesn't work worth a damn.
And I'm just wasting my time
On my suicide lullaby...
I walk towards the light
As your soul replaces mine.
I reach out to feel
But then it all disappears again.
Just another figment
Of my wild imagination.
I guess I need those pills again.
It's time to fulfill my addiction.
Take this pain away from me
'Cause this Novacaine
Doesn't work worth a damn.
And I'm just wasting my time
On my suicide lullaby...
I try to stop the voices
From telling me what to do
In every situation.
But they are persistant.
And they can't hear my screams...
They don't hear my screams anymore...
Take this pain away from me
'Cause this Novacaine
Doesn't work worth a damn.
And I'm just wasting my time
On my suicide lullaby...
And I'm committed to this crime...
With my suicide lullaby...
