I cut the wrist of my left hand
Drupping, dripping,
Dieing, sitting here crying
Sighing, listening to your
Lying
Do I even care?
Do I dare to stare into?
The eyes of darkness open
My heart to the sharpness
Of my heart, my life
Is at steak
Writing suicide notes
In my head, wishing I didnâ€™t
Say what I said
Committing suicide
In my head
