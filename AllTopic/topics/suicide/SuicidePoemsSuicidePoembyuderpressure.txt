I could
take that handful of pills
because honestly
i'm sick of waking up
every morning to ask myself
the same damn questions
I would
slide that blade
across my wrist
because i hate the person
i have become.
I have
daydreams of when
that day will come
where i won't think
I am
scared of myself
I don't want to be
just another line
in a newspaper
I want
for my life
to mean something.
