SIDS babies are the smart ones, they exit early
Adolescents step between cars for a quick out,
or drown in a neighbor’s pool
Teens have the most options with drugs, alcohol,
Anorexia, fast cars and access to guns
Middle-years get to pick from hundreds of prescription drugs, breast/ovarian/prostate cancers or a plethora other diseases
Elders get to have strokes, heart attacks, diabetes and the like
Suicide slow or fast…
No matter, as Death has great patience
