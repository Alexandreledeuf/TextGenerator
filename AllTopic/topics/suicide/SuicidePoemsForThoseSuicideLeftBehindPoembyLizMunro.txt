I can not say
'I understand your pain'
when your pain I haven't been through.
I can only read your words
and tell you that 'I care'.
Suicide is hard to understand
for the one that is left behind,
It's harder if the person left behind is a friend
and you have not 'personally' been affected,
by what they are dealing with.
But, even though,
we have not been through it ourselves,
know that we deeply care,
and although we are halfway around the world
for you,
whenever you are in need,
we will always be there.
