he never loved you
but, thats quite okay
pretty soon, you'll
end your life anyway
no one's ever loved you
and no one really cares
your heart's already shattered
does it hurt as your soul tears
keep putting on your makeup
you'll never have a pretty face
your veins are opened up
your just a f***ing waste
