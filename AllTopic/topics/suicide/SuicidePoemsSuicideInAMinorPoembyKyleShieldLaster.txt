Pounding the keys of life;
There's no margin for error.
One mistake is suicide:
A poet's terror.
Be patient just a bit:
I will bleed you pretty words.
I will sing all of my pain
And numb you like the rain.
Die young, save yourself.
There is panic in old age;
A tongue you cannot cage.
Yes, death is all the rage.
