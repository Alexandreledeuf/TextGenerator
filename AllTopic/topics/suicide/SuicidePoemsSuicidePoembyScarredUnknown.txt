i'm going to run away
i'm leaving this world
for all it has never done
i'm leaving this world
for all it never did
never seemed to care
never showed me love
never showed me joy
never gave me hope
i'm leaving this world
all it gave is pain
and regret
it let me make mistakes
like any normal person
yet i'd go home
and it would throw a knife
straight to my heart
i'm leaving this world
for all it never did
never seemed to care
never showed me love
never showed me joy
never gave me hope
i'm leaving this world
all it gave was pain
all it gave was hate
all it gave was death
i won't be here tomorrow
i won't make it another day
i can't take this pain
i'm tired of feeling numb
the feeling of no feeling
i'm tired of the pain
i long for that feeling
the trusting
the love
the joy
the hope
but no it takes it away
locked inside a box
must keep it away
i'm leaving this world
for all it never did
and all it never gave
