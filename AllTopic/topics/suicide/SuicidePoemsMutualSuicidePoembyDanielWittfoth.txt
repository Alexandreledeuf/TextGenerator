Sufficent breaths
nothing left
of the best
settling for what's thought
good enough
but it's really rough
uncut
Full of hate
anger
meant to die
but wanting to fly
you are the one
left insulted
how's it feel
Not alive
waiting for mutual suicide
just a quick ride
fast
hard fun
the thrill
adrenaline rush
knowing
I am at that breaking point
that's why I run into the arms of
mutual suicide
What do you mean
what's the deal
you say the words
and we both feel like shit
Dull on the inside
victim
on the outside
torn between
middle of me
Not alive
waiting for mutual suicide
just a quick ride
fast
hard fun
the thrill
adrenaline rush
knowing
I am at that breaking point
that's why I run into the arms of
mutual suicide...
