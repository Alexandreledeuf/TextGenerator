I might as well teach myself something useful
And learn to love to hate you well
Then wait to kill you with broken hands
And I wonder, what's a better death?
And can I watch your face
As I kill myself in front of you?
Have my screams run through your veins
The only way to make you not forget me
My blood is on your hands.
There was a time forgetting was better
Now it's more satisfying to watch
Myself die in your sight.
