i  sit here thinking about suicide
everyday i try to talk to my friends
about it i try to make it go away
but it haunts my mind like a ghost
haunts a house my friends try to get
my mind off of it works but then it
comes right back like pain i sit here
with a razor in my hand im thinking
about if i should do it my friend wat
do you say to me about me killing
myself uh wat do you say?
