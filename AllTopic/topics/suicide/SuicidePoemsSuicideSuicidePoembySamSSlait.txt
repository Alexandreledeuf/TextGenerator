Suicide, suicide wishing I were dead,
Suicide, suicide deep in my head,
Suicide, suicide cutting my wrists,
Suicide, suicide I am so done with this.
Two days, two days let until I die,
Two days, two day till the last tear I'll cry,
Two days, two days until I am all gone,
Two days, two days till the dark breaks the dawn.
Suicide, suicide deep inside my head,
Suicide, suicide now I am almost dead,
Suicide, suicide turn out the lights,
Suicide, uicide goodbye and goodnight.
