Suicide is on my mind all the time
how can I get rid of of it
no one can help me now not even god
Im unsaveable
I can see the end of my road
will i die plz help me decide
nothin helps, the coke the drinking the pills it just makes
things worst
Im stuck between realtiy and fansaty
fading in and out all the time
not knowing who to trust and wat the true behind the lie
reading and re-reading suicide poems
the reach say ppl who treat to commictt suicide end up doing it
and to ask myself who would cry I bet no one  cuz
I love no one cuz no one loves me
well my family would cuz there family they have to
unless the hate me to
I would leave and note to say goodbye and to say
now did I open ur eyes
