You'll comit my suicide
You'll push me untill i die
You'll steal the air i breeth
And use it for your own
You'll strangle and choke me
Just for both our peace
You'll comit my sucide
You'll push me until i die
You'll personally take me to my grave
Just you watch as i fade
You may say we're blood
But the thought just makes my blood boil
Oh we are such wonderful friends
I think i'm gonna be sick
You'll comit my suicide
You'll push me untill i die
Just watch as i
Fade away
You steal my breath
And stop my heart
And destroy my little everything
You'll comit my suicide
