A suicide note is the hardest to wright
looking around to see if there is any one in sight
you know you have planed this, now for many days
because of the pain, real in so many ways.
Youre ready for this, right here and right now
you want to die but dont know how
what will they say
knowing you died this way
with youre own two hands
death is all youre mind demands.
At the very last moment there could ever be
You look in the mirror and all you could see
was the look and her face as the tears rolled down
staring at you with that penetrating frown
What should you do, now thats shes seen
how her sister will die only as a teen.
She asks you to stop
she treghtens to call a cop
She cant bear the thought of living alone
having no one to talk to over the phone
the tears keep flowing
as her voice keeps going
praying out loud
there is now a huge croud
in front of you
theres nothing to do.
You turn around and hug her
because between life and death living with her is now what you prefer.
