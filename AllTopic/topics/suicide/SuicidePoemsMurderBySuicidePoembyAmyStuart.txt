Well if you wanted honesty,
Thats all you had to say.
I never want to let you down,
It's better off this way.
Have you heard the news that I'm dead.
As I lay in warm red?
But you just stood there motionless,
As I layed there and bled.
Can you hear me cry out to you,
Words I thought I'd choke on?
But my Black Parade is coming,
This is the round you won.
You can preach all you want,
Who's going to save me?
When I say I'm goign to die,
You just stand there and breathe.
I can tase the metallic blood,
And bone shards from my head.
As my life slowly drifts away,
Oh can you feel the dread.
But your the one who caused all this,
I'm gone because of you.
I don't want you to cry for me,
I'm not crying for you.
Well if you wanted honesty,
That's all you had to say.
I never want to let you done,
It's better off this way.
