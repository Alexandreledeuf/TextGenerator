A person can only take so much,
In my hand, A knife I clutch,
I want to take my life away,
And tell how worthless I am, To say,
I have a frown upon my face,
I want to run away from this place,
And end my life, I want to die,
My head upon my hands, I cry,
To comfort me, It will not work,
Away from the world, I want to jerk,
The one's who love me, Try to make it better,
Forever unknowing, Of that one short letter,
The letter I wrote before I died,
The letter I wrote, of Suicide.
