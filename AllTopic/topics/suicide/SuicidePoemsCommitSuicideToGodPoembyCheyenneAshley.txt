Commit suicide to God
Every single day
Tell Him all your pain
And He'll take it all away
Commit suicide to God
Give Him all your heart
Pray for all your needs
And you'll never grow apart
Commit suicide to God
Tell Him you give up
Fell His love overtake you
And let Him lift you up
Commit suicide to God
Every single day
Give it all to Him
And He'll take it all away
