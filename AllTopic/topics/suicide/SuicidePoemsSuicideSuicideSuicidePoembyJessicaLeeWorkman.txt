Suicide is wishing I were dead
suicide is deep in my head,
suicide thoughts are cutting my wrists burning my ankles,
suicide my last tear dry, suicide.
I’m so done with this days I cry,
last tear dry suicide, suicide, suicide,
deep in my head suicide is because of my voices in my head,
suicide is the blur I see, suicide, is a feeling of someone there,
suicide suicide suicide,
now I’m almost dead turn out the lights and say goodnight
