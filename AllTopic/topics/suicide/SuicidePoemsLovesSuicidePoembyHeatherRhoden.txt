Dreams turned to death,
Voice turned to tears,
Love made her forget,
Love ended her years.
Laughter turned to screams,
Life turned to blood,
Love wasn't what it seemed,
Love just wasn't enough.
Hope turned to loneliness,
Smile turned to a frown,
Love caused this emptiness,
Love pushed her down.
Wishes turned to self-hatred,
Body turned to a shell,
Love turned her blade red,
Love became her hell.
Love turned her cold,
Love killed her inside,
Love destroyed her soul,
Love caused her suicide.
