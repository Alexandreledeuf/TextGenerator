do you know what it feels like
to be excluded from the rest
having no clue where to go next
ever felt so desparate to belong
that is how i feel most of the time
im trying so hard to break the walls
but the walls seem to be made of steel
why is it that no-one undertstands me
i want to run away
to a place i can call my own
i want to scream so loud
and let nobody hear me
im bleeding inside
im sick of having to turn to myself only
im stuck in a world that i hate
i hate not only me but everyone around me
