Yesterday I tried to commit suicide..
The good news is..I didnt succeed..
You dont know how much I tried..
And cut just to watch my arm bleed..
That night I really wanted to die..
I even went looking for pills..
As much as I tried I just couldnt cry..
Just something I couldnt feel..
Its never as hard as it looks..
You have  to trust and  believe me..
Cutting can get you hooked..
And left with the feeling of uncertainty..
Or at least thats what happens to me..
I try so hard to die and dont succeed..
