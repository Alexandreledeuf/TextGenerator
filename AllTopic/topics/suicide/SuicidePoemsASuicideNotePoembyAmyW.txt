A suicide note i write,
for people to understand,
exactly what was going on in my life,
i kept all my troubles inside,
they kept building up and building up,
until in the end
i couldnt take no-more,
i decided to end my life,
it was the only option i had
to get away from it all,
i opened up the kitchen drawer,
a bread knife i saw,
so i slit my wrists,
and watch my blood pour.
