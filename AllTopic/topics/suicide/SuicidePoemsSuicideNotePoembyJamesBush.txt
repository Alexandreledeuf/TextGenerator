I think I should have wrote,
a little suicide note.
In case I decide to end it all,
I wouldnt have to make a call.
It might be under the moon or sun,
maybe by hanging or gun.
It may be during the day or night,
I didnt know which was right.
No one will find me,
I dont want anyone to see,
what I have done,
under the disappearing sun.
I had to get those thoughts out of my head,
even if it means being dead.
Even if my life wasnt that bad,
its my head that was making me sad.
I was sick of trying to strive,
struggling with myself to stay alive.
I felt like I wasnt worth a thing,
I pretended to be happy and sing.
I wish this was a lie,
but truly I wished to die.
No one knew I felt this way,
because I refused to say.
Never again will I see the sun,
truly sorry if I hurt anyone.
I couldnt deal with it like a man,
so I decided to go with the suicide plan.
