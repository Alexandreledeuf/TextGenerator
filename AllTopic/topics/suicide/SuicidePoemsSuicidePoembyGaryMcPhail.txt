Hang me from my sins,
Drown me in my guilt,
Swimming in a pool of blood,
From this pain I have built.
I’m caught in a trap,
A trap I cannot escape,
Its time for me to give up,
And give in to my pain.
I try to hide away,
I live alone at night,
I never want to be afraid,
of this world of life.
There eyes look at me,
They hate me so much,
No matter how hard I try,
I’ll always give up.
