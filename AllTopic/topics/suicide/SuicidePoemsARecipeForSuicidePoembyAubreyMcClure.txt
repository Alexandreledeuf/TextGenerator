A Recipe for Suicide
Take lies and fears
And a pinch of regret and also
A little confusion and mistakes.
Put sickness and worry
And a cup full of betrayal
In an enormous cauldron of tears.
Mix with depression
And a touch of failure
Until tears rush down your face.
Throw in a miscarriage
And a lost love or two.
Then, broil in a broken heart
At one million degrees
Until overwhelmed with grief and sorrow.
You can tell itâ€™s done
When you can stand no more pain.
Let stand until tired of the madness of the world.
Sprinkle on some jealousy
And serve with sadness and unrest.
Taste a touch of suicide.
