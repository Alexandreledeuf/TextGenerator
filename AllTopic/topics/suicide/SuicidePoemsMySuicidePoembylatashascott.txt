my suicide
i want to die
by my looks you want to be me
but you dont know i have nights full of endless
bad dreams so i grab the knife here goes my life
i get the gun this takes a lot of guts
mamas screaming sisters crying while im
in my bedroom dieing
now im sitting on my bed with blood running
down my hands  im one inch away from being dead
i woke up from this dream and started to cry
that was my suicide
