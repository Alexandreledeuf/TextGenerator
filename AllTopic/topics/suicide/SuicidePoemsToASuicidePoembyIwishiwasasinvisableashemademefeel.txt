In this park i used to dwell,
met a guy i loved so well,
there he stole my heart from me,
and now i have to set it free,
sat another girl on his knee,
and told her things he never told me...
Mum came home late that night,
started searching left to right,
through my bedroom door she broke,
found me hanging from a rope...
grabbed a knife and cut me down,
on the floor a note was found,
Mum: Dig my grave,
dig it deep,
marble stone,
from head to feet,
and on the top,
please place a dove,
and tell the world,
i died for love....
