A mother scolds her child for doing wrong-
A reason for the child for suicide!
A teacher canes a girl for her love-song:
The latter fell into a well and died!
A father chides his son for marks, so poor:
The son had fallen headlong from a ledge;
An uncle warns his nephew not to err:
The latter tries to end his life with grudge.
What flimsy reasons drive people to die!
Some use a noose or take o’er-dose of pills!
How stupid can such persons try to be!
Is suicide the solution for ills?
Can God forgive such blunders, causing rift?
Our earthly life is precious-most, God’s gift.
