A man of 19 looks for a quick way to die
He gets on his knees and begins to cry out
The Suicide Angel hears his pleading cries
He knows the man will take his life without a doubt
This angel banished from heaven, not wanted my hell
A patient angel waiting for the next one
Perhaps a mother or father praying to the dark angel
Or perhaps a depressed daughter or a suicidal son
An angel with wings of crimson red
No halo for this fallen son of the most high
His wings stained with blood from the dead
As he poisons his victims hearts with devastating lies
His heart is as black as charcoal
His eyes dark blue as if he was dead
He carries no burden of regret or a sole
His lips as dark as his eyes upon his head
You may wonder who this angel is
If he is real or only in your nightmares
Whether youâ€™ll survive or feel his death kiss
If he is real of is just another legend used to scare
Would you believe me if I told you
Who this angel could really be
Would you call my statement false or true
If I told you this suicide angel is me
