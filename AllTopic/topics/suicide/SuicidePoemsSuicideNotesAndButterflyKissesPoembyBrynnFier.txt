I write my suicide note
So I can be kissed by a butterfly
I can live tonight
But I choose to die
I'm crying on the inside
And bleeding on the outside
I show my pain, blood, and tears
I don't want them to hide
Tears fall from my cuts
As blood drips from my eyes
I see them now
The kissing butterflies
This is my note
For after I die
Goodbye life
Hello butterfly
