Is suicide really suicide or death with a cause
I mean were not breaking any laws
You hate us because we’re different and we dress in black
Because we’re filled with emotion but in conversation we lack
These scar’s we make heal our pain
And stop us going insane
Better to make our blood drip then to spill the lot
Dying happy is fine but living depressed is not
But in the end the choice is yours
Is suicide really suicide or death with a cause
