All these things going through my head
Cannot understand
Whats being said
Cannot understand
What im going through
Its not like you care
I mean nothing to you
This world is my sworn enemy
It and its people
Cannot stand the sight of me
I try the cherish the memories
Of the good times
Which I rarely had
Nothing else comes to mind
It makes me go mad
So I walk upon my shallow floor
Write on the wall
I Cant Take No More!
So Iâ€™ll see the light once and for all
Maybe things get better
When my brains are scattered
Upon the wall
