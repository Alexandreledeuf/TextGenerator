Down the road of destiny
you see your future life
you see your future children
and you see your future wife
Walking down your path of fate
you lose grasp of all your dreams
you cant find your accomplishments
you lose site of everything
Which path to take, you cant decide
but now you have to choose
on one its what you gain that counts
and the other its what you lose
You must pick now, your time is up
which road will you now take?
maybe the path of destiny
or even the path of fate.
Life or death.......which matters most
you should've thought before,
before you decided to get drunk
and you drove down to the store.
You knew that it was comming
your mom said dont drink and drive
maybe you should've listened
and you might still be alive.
