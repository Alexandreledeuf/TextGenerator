O' melody queen
Keep on whirring
And denting
Signature of a new day with your beak
On murky glass of my window.
O' melody queen
Remain my alarm clock forever
And wake me up every morning
With your mellifluous tunes.
O' melody queen
Be my fortuneteller for lifetime
And bring me luck each day
With your lyrical expressions.
