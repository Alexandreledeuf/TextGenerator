A distant dream
just to make it big
waiting for just that hit! ! !
Not a mirage in science
not a fiction in literature
just a desire to be there...
The urge in me,
and also to fulfill
my parents' desire
I got to be there.
Don't wanna make that 'big'
but have to be there somewhere high
where my parents can proudly say,
'she's   our  daughter'
Can't tell if I become an ace in some field
how my bro's cool attitude will get cooler.
Hope I come out with flying colors sooner! ! !
Don't know what life has
in store for me.
I just leave everything to Almighty
to decide my    'DESTINY'
