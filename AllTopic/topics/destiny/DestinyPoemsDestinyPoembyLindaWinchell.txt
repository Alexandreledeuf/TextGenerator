Flirt with me today
and you may lust for my tomorrows.
Seek the fate I have in store for you
And you may have not time for borrow.
Destiny has it written
Written down in every page well.
It is the fate we all must spend in life
Destiny has you under its destined spell.
Some may make it to the top
Then some not even to take a step.
But whatever you think you all deserve
It is but destiny in this life you'll get!
Some may seem to die before their time
Then others you wonder why they've not?
You see that is just their destiny
And it is all of what they'd got.
Some rich, some poor as church mice
Then others never seem to have to work at all!
It all lie within their destiny you see
It lie within each destiny that was called.
