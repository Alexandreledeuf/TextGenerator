My impuissance always haunted me like a nightmare,
I always stood alone even in a busy fair
My thoughts ghosted me like a vulture looking for its prey,
Even my spirit was bemused when indulged with life in a woozy fray
Life always seemed to be a tyranny,
With happiness peeping in my life occasionally, as an irony
Winds of lust and anger swayed my thoughts to everywhere,
I neglected my friends and kin and even forgot my prayer
The path of desperate desires where pleasing my eyes,
I buried the essence of my soul for a life full of spice
Then came the irruption of thoughts out from the convoluted mind,
Those were nothing but the poisons hived in handsome rind
I left my kingdom of desires, as I lost my assailable world of fantasy,
Colours of joy withered and life turned out to be a bitter legacy
Sooner my spirit languished and then grief followed felicity,
And lifeâ€™s lancinating experiences even bewildered me without pity
In this whole turmoil my love was lost and my whole world went in a toss,
Valley of distress was now my abode, I sought the shrouded and obscured cause
Soon I agnised, my thoughts were no more my allies,
That sole thought made my stout frame paralyse
My spirit was now longing to live a life of solitude,
A life of hermit, so I could stand from my vicious thoughts at an altitude
Meditation and contemplation became the wings of my spirit,
My thoughts sublimated and mind stood there as an obedient valet
I am now the master and he is my dutiful servant,
I subdued him with my spiritual power though he was egotist and arrogant
Days have passed when I was a mere puppet in the hands of life,
Now I choose the course of life frivolously without any strife
Life has now bestowed me with all the blessings,
I could see today the compassion of all beings
Life is only meant for love and sharing,
This is the only testament that could free the spirit from wearing
At this moment I am overwhelmed with joy and ecstasy,
The umpteen invaluable benedictions, cosmos showering, I could see
Inner realm of my heart is rejoicing with blissful delight,
I am no more in fright with life, though I am still a child of destiny.
