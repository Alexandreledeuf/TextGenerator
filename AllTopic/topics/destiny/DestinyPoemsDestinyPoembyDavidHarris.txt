I stood on a hill overlooking the sea,
and wondered what my destiny be.
Would I be loved or would I be lonely?
Would I sail on a pirate clipper
in search of some lost treasure?
The wind ruffled my hair,
but the sea never spoke to me.
Every person has a journey,
for some it is long,
while others it is short.
No one can read our destiny;
we only make it what it is to be.
