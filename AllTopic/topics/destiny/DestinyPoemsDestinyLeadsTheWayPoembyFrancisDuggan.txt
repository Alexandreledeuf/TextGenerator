All through your great life journey you follow your destiny
And where you are living at today is where you are meant to be
And whether you live in your Hometown or from there live far away
It all goes back to destiny where you are at today
We make our own decisions and for our mistakes we pay
Yet in the course of our destiny we do not have a say
From the moment we are born our pathways through life are paved
And the destinies of our life's journeys in our souls are engraved
Though many will tell you differently they say our life's journey is our own choice
But destiny the silent one never does heed advice
And even those who do not believe in it follow it every day
Where-ever their journeys take them to destiny leads the way
And whether you travel far from home or live in your own country-side
Destiny of seven letters your life's journey decide.
