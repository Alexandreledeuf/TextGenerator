**FATE AND DESTINY!
I couldn’t quite figure out till date,
If destiny makes us or we make our fate!
If what is destined can never be changed,
Why struggle at all, just blame it on fate? !
But today I recall that old story line,
Young Napoleon was once a truant child!
His worried mother took the child, -
To seek a fortuneteller’s advice!
The old teller had smiled and said, -
‘Madam your son has no line of fate! ’
Young Napoleon took out his pen knife,
Cut his palm to carve his fate line!
Rest is history nothing more need be said;
You may now decide about that line of
fate!

I wanted to write about lighter things!)
