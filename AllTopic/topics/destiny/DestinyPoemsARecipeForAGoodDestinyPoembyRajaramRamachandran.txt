Your thought of a drink,
Kindles a desire,
For a peg.
Your desire for a peg,
Takes you,
To the bar.
Your visit to the bar,
Leads you,
Drink a peg.
Your first peg in the bar,
Makes you,
A habitual visitor.
Your character,
As a regular visitor,
Names you, a drunkard.
As a drunkard you're,
The day isn't far,
For your rest in the grave.
A thought of the Lord,
Creates a desire,
To see Jesus.
A desire to see Jesus,
Leads you,
To the nearest Church.

Makes you,
A habitual visitor.
Your habitual visit to the Church,
Converts you,
A devotee of the Lord.
You're, as a servant of the Lord,
Destined to His abode,
On the day of judgment.
Now, you know the recipe,
Of your own destiny,
To keep you ever happy.
