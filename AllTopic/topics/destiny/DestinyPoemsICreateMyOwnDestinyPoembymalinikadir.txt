Freedom is my birth right!
I feel if the world would revolve on its own beat and spin......
It is beautiful in its own.....
Man  must learn to accept realities as they are
Face it on the face
With acceptance walk his path
This solves most problems in its root
It is influencing
Trying to influence
To dream
Creating virtual reality
That is man's birth
On earth
Some create with tools'
Some with action
Others with money
few with words
Each soul born
Leaves his mark
The circle of influence may vary
Each soul
must his burden
He alone bear
No love
Can barrow pain
Sharing and caring
Is making this stay a heaven
Holding grudges and competing
Enhances productivity and negativity
Duality is here for eternity
you may or may not acknowledge
Change is constant
For man is for ever evolving.......
You too must change
as must I.
Choice is  that which determines destiny!
I create my own destiny!
