I'm the richer, among these thieves
A mighty gem, scattered the world over
A world overlord, looking over the waters
For beyond these shores I'm assured to own others
The death of a nation, the birth of a dynasty
An empire the sun never settles on
Meaning it's on-going, and that it's no rest
For my off-shore investments, my foreign possessions
Longing for freedom, peace, and love
And receiving none
