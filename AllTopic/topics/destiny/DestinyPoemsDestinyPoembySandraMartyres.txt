We plot our own destiny
Be it the path to happiness
Or the road to ruin.
Despite the highs and lows of our lives
It is we and we alone
Who plot our own destinies.
We can choose to be changed
Or be the agents of change
We can remain chained
To the taboos imposed by society
Or we can unchain ourselves and be free
Whatever we chose will finally
Make or mar our destiny.
