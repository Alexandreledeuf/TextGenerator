I packed my bags
and left the house
to a DESTINY,
that i knew was not easy.
I knew there were obstacles on the way
still i knew i had to stay
the path was uneven, uneasy
but i knew i could not quit
because i knew it was my DESTINY.
I felt like an ant on the Noa's ark
i was alone there on the path,
i had no-one to discuss my worries
happines seemed to be buried
no shoulder to cry upon
no buddy to depend on
i felt like an ant on the Noa's ark
i knew i was alone there on the path.
Then an idea striked my mind,
to think and find
where the path was leading me to,
the answer i got was an unknown DESTINY where i had to go.
I dint know why
all i knew was that i had to fly
and reach the heights of my DESTINATION
for i knew in the end my life had to be an inspiration.
