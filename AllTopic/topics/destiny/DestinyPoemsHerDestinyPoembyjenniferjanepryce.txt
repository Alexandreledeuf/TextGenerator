Her Destiny
She is on the edge of a branch
Too light to fall
Too heavy to hover
Balanced, so precariously
Looking down on her life’s ending
The sweet nothingness
Head bowed and body swaying
Crowded with voices,
Questions being her only thoughts
Life for her is a roundabout
That she cannot get off
Could she fall, could she do it?
Could she hold on if she tipped?
Clawing back, making a last decision
Heart beating fast and hard
Back to where though?
To her branch?
To the ever tipping scales
Back to the something that is indecision
Unbearable indecision
Life has no way for her
No way for this girl
Neither mapped out nor planned
But excruciatingly paused at
Life’s endless boundary
A contradiction of a life
No supporting branch
No tree of life
She can’t get back now
Not back far enough to hold on
To her tree of life
She will stay swaying, teetering
Until she falls,
No longer light,
Too heavy to hover
To her life’s end
Her only destiny
