If you had one chance,
Would you take it?
If you were given a taste of your dreams,
Would you take it?
If you were shown what you dreamed of,
Would you take it?
Don’t you see?
This is my destiny,
All roads have leaded here.
If you greatest fear was taken away,
Would you take it then?
If all the problems were take way,
Would you take it?
If you were given the chance to show your potential,
Wouldn’t you take that chance?
Don’t you see?
This is my destiny,
All roads leaded here.
All I had to do was make a sacrifice,
And look what I have got?
If that was the only thing you had to do,
Wouldn’t you do it for the chance?
Wouldn’t you do for your destiny?
Your destiny?
Don’t you see?
This is my destiny,
All roads leaded here.
You just don’t understand,
It’s my destiny to be here,
To do all this,
You say don’t believe in destiny?
I say that you do,
You just don’t know it yet.
