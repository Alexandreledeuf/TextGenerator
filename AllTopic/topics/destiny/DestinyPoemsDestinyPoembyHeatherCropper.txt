nothing better than not knowing what's going to happen,
nothing better than eating chocolate to numb the pain.
wishing my friends knew that i love them,
wishing he knew im madly in love with him.
hoping the best comes out of my mistakes,
hoping i live to see tomorrow.
listening to the ones i love the most,
listening to the pounding heart in fear.
seeing nothing but a fanasty world,
seeing the truth that lies behind your eyes.
tasting the truth of life,
tasting the pain of unknown.
living like theres no tomorrow,
living without the truth.
smelling the sweet revenge,
smelling the destiny that lies within.
