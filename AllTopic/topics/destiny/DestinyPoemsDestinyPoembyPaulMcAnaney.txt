I now gaze fixedly and intently  upon our predetermined destiny and realize that  our love is nothing but a perversion of reality, A distortion of equality, nothing but a cataclysmic consequence of infatuation.
I  foresee the dark ahead even as we lay enervated by our unsheathed passion and as the incandescent glow of our love begins to  attenuate i realize this is our destiny our never ending legacy.
I now lament that which is our destiny for it is not that of which i had envisioned for us, now i fear our destiny is sealed as the wheels of fate conspire to rob us of our eternal desire.the life we shared smolders in the ashes of our future. This is to be our destiny
