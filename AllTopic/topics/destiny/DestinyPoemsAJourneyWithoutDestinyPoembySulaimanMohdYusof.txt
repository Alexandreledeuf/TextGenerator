The voices of hope......
Screaming for lives..
Were not fulfilled
The truth is
We can't handle the truth
Take me to the place...
Where the weather
Is fine all around
We could live
Till the world
Is no longer exists...
and remember
The arts of love
Implies to flirtation
Your longing....
Is descriptive
Well painted
onto the canvas of psychopath
A journey without destiny...
Is a long lost destination
Only the determined
Would understand
and nodded
