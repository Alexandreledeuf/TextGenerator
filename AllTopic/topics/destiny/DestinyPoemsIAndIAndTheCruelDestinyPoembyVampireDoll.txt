I cannot love
For I will die.
So much passion I keep
That is only known for me inside.
No one sees the grace
In every tear I cry.
For no one deserves the greatnes
Of my eye.
Untouchable I seem to be,
But indeed I'm not.
A queen of dammned souls I am
Love I cannot be worth of.
For this is the destiny I have to live
And one day leave.
My soul is empty
Without the mother of all feelings
Love.
