Let's be one
Once again
Open your heart
For me again
We'll return
To paradise
Lost in each
Others eyes
Sharing dreams
That come true
Forever making
Love with you
Greeting every
Morning sun
Growing old
Staying young
Slowly slipping
Into eternity
This is
Our destiny
(FOR THOSE WHO GET A SECOND CHANCE.REMEMBER, THE PAST HAS NO FUTURE IN THE PRESENT.)
