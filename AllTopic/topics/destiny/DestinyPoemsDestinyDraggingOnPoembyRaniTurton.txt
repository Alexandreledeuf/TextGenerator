My destiny is tired.
The slope leads upwards, onwards,
Into clouds and far beyond.
My destiny, like me, walks slowly
Mumbles softly
Remembers ancient rhymes.
My destiny, not knowing why
Hardly realising that every game has it's rules
Has decided to try
Though, tired, and betrayed,
A little bit frayed
Has decided
To carry on, far beyond, with aching feet,
On the winding path, the trees
The boulders and rocks
To avoid the torrent gushing beneath.
