I still love you,
You abandoned me,
When I was too young,
I was taught to hate you,
I could not, though I did try,
I still love you,
Crave for your love too,
You did not even tell me,
Why you did, what you did to me,
Was I wrong in being what I was to you?
I still love you,
I was born to you,
It was your choice, to bring me in,
I had not asked for it,
But you still did, what you did to me,
I still love you,
Will you ever come back to take me,
I am growing up neglected,
I wish I survive that wait till eternity,
And you get back to me, your destiny.
