What is a child’s destiny?
Is it our corrupt family structure, politics, prices, poverty, poor housing or our social condition?
Is it fair to let him face such a world?
Why create a generation and let them die in no time
Is it fair to let him face such a world?
Why create a child without a destiny.
Don’t do it for fun or for a pastime,
A child is important
Never create a being without a purpose
Think about the destiny of a child.
