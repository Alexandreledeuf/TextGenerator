With fairy dust
of altered belief
I sprinkled some
powdery sugar
on a worn-out bee
trapped on my side
of the screened-window.
whose spirit is entwined
with your destiny?
My flesh quivers...
Drawn towards the edge
of absolute certainty
In the subterranean depth,
the buzzing sound
grows dimmer.
Death! wielding
over life
A transient passage
into a place
where  silence
is gone...
