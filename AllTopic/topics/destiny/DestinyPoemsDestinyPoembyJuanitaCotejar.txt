To a woman's womb evolves...
from conception through the waiting of an exact moment
to breathe life....
Between that time of birth....
until  man's journey through his existence is a struggle
to find the reason to go on....
Searching an answer from an emptiness within...
and open up to that basic light we were born into
Get into that feeling of wholeness, completeness
that you want to give something... out of your existence
And then someone accepted it... and you get connected
that something is given back, and you feel...
a kind of POWER, every man's dying to have...
Fulfilling this process would reveal
the Mystery of DESTINY... that
What we've been looking for... is ALWAYS HERE WITH US!
