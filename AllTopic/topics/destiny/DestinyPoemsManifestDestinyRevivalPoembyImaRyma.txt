Post - Revolutionary War,
With 13 new states in the east,
The Feds said, 'Got to get some more -'
'All the way west, to say the least.'
Over the years some land was bought.
Lots more was spoils of victory.
No matter how it all was got,
It was 'manifest destiny.'
Today's south border - what to do?
The Feds are stuck in politics.
Look to the historical cue.
Money and might should be the fix.
To stop the border's northern flow,
Buy or wage war on Mexico.
