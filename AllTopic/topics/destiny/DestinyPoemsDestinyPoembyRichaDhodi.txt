Destiny is destined,
What is decided by him is fated,
And we sometime stop our selves thinking we can’t do this,
But honest application and focused actions can lead to tangible achievements,
Life is an unpredictable flow,
And God doesn’t believe in orchestrating our entire life.
Destiny is choice,
Where things occurring or to be occurred is in our hands,
Luck is nothing but a matter of thought,
It’s our flexible thoughts and actions which are the role players,
Distorted ways will even meet a lucid end,
So always relish and experience every moment,
And be destined to do better always.
