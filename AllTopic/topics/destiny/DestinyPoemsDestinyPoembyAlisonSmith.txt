What a strange life one must lead
Heading towards our destruction
We are born to die
But first we must survive
Someone has planned that at a point in our lives
We will decide to destruct
Nothing will equal that time
For that will be our climax
Everything we feel is perfect
Though its not as perfect
As the time we reach our destiny
What strange happenings will befall us all
Before our final performance?
How many times will we conclude
That nothing can be as great as this?
Try as we will the conclusion
Will be the best performance of our lives
For within us all
Is the desire to leave the world dramatically.
We all must leave our mark
Be it only that we have lived
It is a mark
Before I go I want to say
Thankyou for letting me go this way
Donâ€™t tell me when I must go
For I know when my final performance will be.
Prepare me to judge as I will be judged
So that I can know when and how to help
Make it hard to understand
So that my feelings will be my guide.
