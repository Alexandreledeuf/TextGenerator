Here I stand in the darkness of the night
Where only the stars see me,
For I am in the blackest shadows
Flat up against a wall
And the only thing you can see
Is the glint of my blue eyes.
My heart is running at a staggered tempo
Because I can feel you near me
Your presence is like a ghost
Unseen, like me
But we’re both searching for something,
Looking for the person we know is out there
The one we sense will make us feel alive.
Bound together by a force to strong to resist
You walk closer,
Even though you can’t see
And stop, a foot away.
I hold my breath
Trying not to make a noise
Yet wanting to let you know I’m there
Your eyes lock with mine,
And I can’t help gasping.
Because blood has gone boiling.
My eyes go dark as I take you in,
And you walk closer ‘till you’re a mere breath away,
Tilting my head up, I look at you,
And you raise your hand,
Wrapping it around my neck,
Then, without a word,
Your head lowers to mine,
In an endless kiss of destiny.
