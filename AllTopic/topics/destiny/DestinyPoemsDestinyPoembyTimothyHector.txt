We met at the pool when you were just a kid
such a gentle soul, a life barely lived
i had to leave for a little while
you welcomed me back with that same warm smile
i wanted to know you just a bit better
that one night lasted almost forever
i guess u dont know it yet but
that night you saved me from inner death
for some strange reason i felt a connection
one i havent felt in 19 years life lessons
as time went on we only got closer
i prayed day and night for it never to be over
but the past shows us nothing last forever
why didnt i try to do things a bit better
i became selfish, greedy and one track minded
i wanted you all to myself until i was reminded
that things arent always as they seem
it was just all my pathetic little dream
we learnt together a long time ago
life without the other just wasnt the go
we cant be together and cant be without
i should never have opened my big mouth
so here we are now trying to patch this up
what brought this on so quickly, so abrupt
of course thats right it was me
chasing my fabricated destiny
i hope we can move past this mess
i know i will try my absoloute best
i want, no i need you in my life
who is to say wether its wrong or right
time is the only judge, that will truly decide
wether i should leave this place or swallow my pride
because i dont want to lose you or have to leave
we are destined to be just friends, i have to believe
