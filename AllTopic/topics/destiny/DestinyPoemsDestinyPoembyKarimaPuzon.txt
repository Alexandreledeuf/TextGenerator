How could this happen?
I found you and you found me...
Such an awkward thing just happened
Deep in my heart I know you are
My destiny
What a sweet thing
That we are both looking in the same bright sky..
Watching the star sparkles at night
I really believe that
You are
My destiny
Why from the moment I saw you
My heart melted so fast like ice?
How could this be?
I know that it just can be true
That you are the one
My destiny
My heart is beating so fast when you are near
It pumps like it never been before
I know our heart beats the same way
Cos I know you are
My destiny
I really wanted someone like you
The person that can really hold on me
Someone who can love me forever
I know it is you
'Cause you are
My destiny
Maybe all we need is just to believe on each other
I know we can make it through
Just hold my hand..
Look in to my eyes
Love will find a way
I know it would be okay
My destiny
I know
I believe
We are meant to be
With all my heart and soul
I will give you all my love
My destiny
