Destiny hopefully knocks on our door at the right time
because I know I missed the train and forgotten my ticket
when it has tried to give me a chance
I have become ecstatic and full of light
ever since destiny came together
like a puzzle
I had the box and the pieces in my possession
but I guess it took a little bit of time
because I over think
I over analyze
I have this unbeatable streak
of missing destiny's knock on the door
Well finally I answered and
everything is coming together
No missing pieces no bent
or child manipulated pieces
Just a brand new box with
the plastic wrapping right next to it
with the steep price tag of 31 years
The pieces are all out
like my exposed heart
Everything is there
Everything is fastened together
Everything is great
I apologize to myself
for wasting so many years
before I found my destiny
