I think I know surely where I 'm living
though my thought's full with uncertainty
days and nights pass away  unfriendly
without doing anything
to decrease temperature of my heart
Which was scattered by a girl
or an animal
or my bosom friend.
Angry wind and rain
and the spears and knives  from the Satan's hands
cannot make to weaken
the strength and soul of my life
though they live together with in me
even in my  dreams.
They will blame me
if I show my love on the air
as the light of the little star
of the darkest night
but I'll say and to for someone as I can
because you have your troubles enough
as long as
you're something of the universe.
Very quickly
leaves dry out
and flowers wither
when the sun shines the most brightly
but I'm neither the leaves nor flowers
so, I 'll go on my way
for long nights and days
across the oceans and sparks
to please  the weary and wretched hearts.
