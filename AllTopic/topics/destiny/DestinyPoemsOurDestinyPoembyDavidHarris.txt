Standing here on the threshold
of a brand new dawn,
we ponder over things
wondering if we belong
within this crazy world of ours.
Wondering if our destiny
waits for us somewhere else.
We never know the outcome
until the time comes along.
There is no way to change it
and no reason to do it.
Just let the future
shape our destiny
whenever and wherever
that might eventually be.
