No man need fear his Destiny's bad course,
When challenges, he meets resolutely;
Defying it and hitting hard with force;
with prudent action, that is done timely.
Who cares about destiny's monstrous face,
If man can take refuge in God's Love-shield?
Why worry of Destiny's losing case,
When God gives grace and much wisdom to field.
You must refuse defeat in many things;
Just labour hard towards success by heart;
Yet, patiently take whatever life brings;
The Creator will surely do his part.
No Destiny threatens a Lion-heart;
Nor earthly wealth to Heaven do we cart.
