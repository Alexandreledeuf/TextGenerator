Cruel destiny that cursed me
To the sky Iâ€™m wondering
How could it be?
Without love do I have to live?
One day the sun came into my door
His beauty face made me fall
But In the shadows I got lost
The truth that I ignored
Twice I think I loved someone
But no one ever love me that much
This cruel destiny had been so mean
Putting this curse on me
Spanish, Destino cruel
