Is it destiny that we met?
Like thunder and lightning we click each other.
Is it destiny that we parted?
Like heaven and earth we miss each other.
Is it destiny that we are made for each other?
Like the poles of a magnet attracted together.
Is it destiny that we had lost each other?
Like the world vanishing to nether.
My love, can we meet again?
Can heaven be kind to seal us again?
Can we pray to god to unite us again?
Can lord make this unity a everlasting one?
