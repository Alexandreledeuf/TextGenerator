By the cottage near the lake, there moonlit
walks we would partake.
~
An there still stands the tall oak tree, where
a heart is etched and our names they be.
~
They shalt never fade away. Just as our love
'tis here to stay.
~
Our love is strong an keeps on growing
branching out and forever flowing.
~
Soaring above the heavenly sky so high.
This shall be '' our destiny '' and against
all odds - defy...
