Dealing with your life in a nowhere land,
Establishing connections, but breaking something else,
Surrounded by the sharks, hiding for happiness,
Trying to fight desires, dreams and passions that can tempt
Invading your mind and soul with flakes of love like a tsunami…
None of us knows the way to the unleashed passion…
You know that even though… there is a thing we cannot stop…
And that is… our destiny!
