Wounded by destiny, I struggle,
For a life, I thought never existed,
A life without his touch,
A life without his shine,
A life without his love,
A life that was never mine
Stabbed by the truth of his death, I breath,
An air devoid of that fragrance,
Fragrance of trust, so scattered,
Fragrance of loyalty that mattered,
Fragrance of faith, so divine,
Fragrance of love, you were never mine
Strangled by his thoughts, I died,
In the shades of his memories,
Memories of the way he loved me,
Memories of the way he cared,
Memories of the times I cried,
Memories of the promises we made
