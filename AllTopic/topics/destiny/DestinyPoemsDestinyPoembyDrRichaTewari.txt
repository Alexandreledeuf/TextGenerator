A consistent soul believes in destiny,
A capricious one in chance –
Dare to realize success
If you have the courage to trance.
The tallest trees are most in the blasts of the tempest,
Pay your premium off to ambition or have a rest.
Dreams are like stars you may never touch,
Chase and chase – look! Destiny be in your clutch
I trust my soul,
And my only goal
Is just to be its choice – not chance –
That decides your destiny at a glance.
