If you're really so far,
and in love with someone else..
How come i still feel your
presence then,
like you're inside me
somewhere..
You said, i should try to forget
you,
and the dreams together we
shared.
So i forgot even my own image,
but you're still inside my head.
I cross the crowded streets,
pretending you're walking
beside me.
I hardly stand in front of mirror,
not to see the truth it would
make me see.
Deep inside, heart knows that i'm
a loner,
and that's exactly what i was
meant to be..
Whatever you'll throw my way,
i'll accept it as my Fate's Destiny.
