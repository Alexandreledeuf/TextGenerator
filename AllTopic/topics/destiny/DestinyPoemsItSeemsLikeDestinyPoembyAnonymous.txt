To get you to smile means the world to me
I dont know where to begin
Through thick and thin
And in between
You loving me has been a dream
I always wondered if dreams came true
It was proved to me the day i met you
I love you soo much you'll never know
Day by day my love for you grows
Love has always been a game for me
But with you loving me
It seems like destiny
