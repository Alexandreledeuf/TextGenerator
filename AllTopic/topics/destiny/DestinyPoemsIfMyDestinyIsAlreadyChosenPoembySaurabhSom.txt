If my destiny is already chosen....
Then why do I need to make it MINE?
If I was to live like this
Then why did I have to redefine
The meaning of death
And this drastic lose of faith...?
Gods are getting scarce.......
Worshipping affinity we are
Distortion's the order of the day
Mistrust is here only to stay
Stitching together
The images of fear
Destiny replacing 'curse'.....
Gods... they ARE getting scarce.......
