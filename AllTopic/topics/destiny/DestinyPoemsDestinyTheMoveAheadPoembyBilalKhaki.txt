Lowing to self I ask slow,
O my master! Where to go?
Said the self left in me,
“To wandering paths in woods and meads
lying ahead in world of treads.”
“To the path which lead you to
the valley of thy destined goal.
Not the path which left you in
the valley of horrible den.”
Thus answered the other power.
and left me in a confused mark.
I felt done when a voice within
told me a certain thing.
“Never to worry what path grace
All paths go….. To same place.”
