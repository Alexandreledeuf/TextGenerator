It's funny how the ones who show you the most love,
Are often the ones who say it the least
It's funny how the ones who tell you they love you the most,
Are often the ones that hurt you the most
It's funny how the ones who beg for forgiveness,
Are often the ones who least deserve it
It's funny how the ones who mess everything up,
Are often the ones who make you feel guilty
It's funny how the ones who are the happiest,
Are often the ones who've known the most heartache
It's funny how those hearts can always mend themselves,
If you give them enough time and space
It's funny how this life just keeps going,
No matter how hard you may beg it to slow down.
