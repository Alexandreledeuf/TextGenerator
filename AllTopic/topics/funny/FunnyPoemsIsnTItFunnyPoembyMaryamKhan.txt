Think about it
Isn't it funny?
The world we are living in is just a dream
We are bad
We are doing evil
We waste our time running for money
We waste our time trying to get famous
But we don't see whats real
We don't realize the real person we are
We know the fact yet we don't notice it
Isn't it funny?
You may die tomorrow
Just think
You may die tomorrow
No money
No fame
No fun
No evil
Life's over!
Thats what we don't realize
Nothing is for granted
Not even our life
We may die tomorrow
So be a better man and don't live for life
Be a better man live for the death
You never know when your time comes
You never know when your time's up!
See the mirror
And ask the man in the mirror
Ask him to change himself
I wanna get this message straight
I wanna get this clear
You better change yourself
Maybe the time is near
