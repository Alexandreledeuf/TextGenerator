Once, there was a white cat
Who was really, really fat
So fat
She looked like a bat
Who has eaten a huge rat.
The cat was walking in the street
Following a beat, with her feet
Tic, tac, tic, tac
Tictactictactictac
Looking for anything to eat
Milk, fish, tuna, meat...
But what a pity
The street was empty
So empty
Not even a birdie
To make her get nasty.
The cat kept walking in the street
Following a beat, with her feet
Tic, tac, tic, tac
Tic, tac, tic, tac
Looking for somewhere to sleep
Bed'n'sheets? Get real! Just a seat...
But she didn't find any, what a shame
Because she was really lame
So lame
She had forgotten her own name
And from where she originally came.
So she kept walking in the street
Feeling the heat, and pain in her feet
Tic, tac, tic, tac
Tic,              tac
Looking for someone to blame
Same situation, same game...
Then, the white cat
Saw a tiny red hat
One hat
She ran, jumped and sat
In it, what a lucky cat!
But since she was really fat
She got stuck in the hat
So stuck
She looked like a rat
In a cheese trap.
A dog came walking in the street
Following a beat, with his feet
Tic, tac, tictac
Tic, tac, tictac
He saw something red
So he stopped near the cat's head:
'Haha! Cat, you pay the fees
For acting so bad with your peers! '
'Help, please'
'Call me bad boy, I love to tease
I'm getting outta here, say cheers! '
Then a bird came flying in the street
With his wings, following a beat
Tictactictactictac
Tictactictactictac< br>He saw something red
So he stopped above the cat's head:
'Oh, poor white cat
Are you trapped in this hat? '
'Damn I am! '
'Let me help you, sad little cat
Here, you're out, care for a chat? '
Rumors I heard
Say the cat ate the bird.
