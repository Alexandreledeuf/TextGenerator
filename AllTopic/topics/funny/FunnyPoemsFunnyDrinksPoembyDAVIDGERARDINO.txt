exhaustion fell on this dread,
like mold on these piano keys,
it stunk up the place, still i had
to investigate this electrical
storm, untill i at least isolate
this despondent dyke from killing
itself, and she cries becouse the
cows have no milk,
or the chords have no sound,
or this rain provides no drink.
