I had a little puppy dog,
He was Jully the funny dog,
He did walk and sleep and run with me,
All I had to do was keep him clean.
He was really scared of my cat,
He used to hide under the mat,
He barked a lot when he saw the ants,
He used to rip off my Uncle’s pants.
He hates the cow in the farm,
There’s not one day he didn’t bring down the farm,
The cow was angry with him one time,
That she poked him with her horns and went far aside.
If someone shouted at me once or twice,
He would bark and bark at him more than a thrice,
A chick once he tried to swallow,
But, poor me! He couldn’t do more than a hallow.
When it is bedtime, he slept with me,
The blanket went to him rather than me,
He is good example that barking dogs never bite,
But do remember, his bark is worse than his bite.
