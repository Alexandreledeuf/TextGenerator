all the money
to the last penny
was found to be proxy
in that country
all essentials
should be freely available
the governance ordered
which brought in this disorder
who does not have a need
for the essentials
right from the cop to the thief
had a need for it that day
opened stores were looted
closed one's were broke open
hand in glove were they
the cop and the thief
a commotion in town
every law broken
the temples barren
even the priest lost his calm
a situation which would not calm down
the governing body had almost broke down
a let loose situation for the hooligans
WHO DOES NOT HAVE A NEED FOR ESSENTIALS
GOD INTERVENED
A FUNNY SITUATION DEMANDED...
A SUPER POWER'S INTERVENTION
AN EARTH QUAKE ROCKED THE TOWN
ALL LOOTERS WERE DRIVEN OUT OF STORES
TO SEE MAN MADE ESSENTIALS CRUMBLE
LIFE THE MOST ESSENTIAL
