Believe me, I run from dying
I know, it's so dumb, but funny trying
WAR, around me everywhere
SOLDIERS, killing everyday, I swear.
Truly, I have nothing to fear
Because when I look in the mirror
I see myself with no hair
A jock, playing, fakinit, like its there
I know... you hate that, my dear
Made your point of view Claire
Telling me, if I show up, you will run out there
Hiding from me, on your feet, downstairs
Anyway, sweetie, anyway, truly I don't care
Whatever you say honey, you love me
With your smile you illuminate my world
You can't imagine my happy feelings,
whenever I tell you, that, without you,
my life has no meaning at all
I love myself, maybe, but I've loved you before
Knowing in your heart Im not outdoors
Because you love me too and I am sure
I Hope, my life is long, because we are made for it
You are what a man wants from this life and more
I love you, its true and beautiful
So let us live our magic story
All thank to My dear friend Cruz
