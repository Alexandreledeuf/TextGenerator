Welcome to the Colosseum
Where pain is pleasure and it is our pleasure to be of service
Lay back on the rack
The waxing poetics are hot and the iced humor is very dry
The fence sitter splinters are sharp but the elitist tongues are sharper
There are many painful pleasures which abound
We guarantee your total satisfaction
Or we'll give you fifty lashes of your back for free
For no one ever enters with a smile
Who doesn't leave here with a grimace
