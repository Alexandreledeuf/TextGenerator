Oxymorons are 2 contradicting words,
Now tell me, isn't that absurd?
An example of this is virtual reality,
Is that possible or just a casual formality?
What about the living dead,
Am I just being a butt head?
Am I leading this into a fine mess?
Isn't this moment priceless?
Don't worry; the poem is nearly done,
I'm just having a bit of serious fun.
Am I truly a big baby?
Well, it's a definite maybe.
Well I'm going to give you a practice test,
Tell me now, who is the second best.
I thank God that I'm an Atheist,
Also thank Him that I am a cautious optimist.
Now I am all alone,
In my office that's also my home.
Eating my very bland spice,
Wasn't this poem awfully nice?
