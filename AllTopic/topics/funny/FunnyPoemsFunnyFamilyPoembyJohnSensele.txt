Sisters and brothers you belong together
Although you pray, mostly you play
To teach, to reach, to fetch one another
Even when your love groove you delay.
Together you sit, you eat, you study
You talk to them and you poke fun
At your mom who's your bosom buddy
And dear pop likes your witty pun.
Sometimes family irritates you stacks
Your fashion, your tuition they select
To pass on wisdom with love packs
When wrong choice you're about to elect.
Whatever the mood is in your cosy family
They mean well in all they choose to do;
Celebrating you or reading you riot homily
They love you. They do care, your home crew.
