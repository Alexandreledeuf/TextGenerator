hei, hei, hei, hei,
heih, heih, heih, heih,
who says one, is only one?
One only one and remain only one,
One and one not make eleven,
join to make it, only remain one,
one will always remain only one,
try, try and try, one will remain one
One mixing with one
make it within one,
one minus one will not remain one;
life is zero without only one,
Even God is one, add no more one,
Add more and more, may not look even,
Christ is one, Allah is one,
They represent one. Mighty only one,
Heaven is one, hell also one,
universe is one and earth also one,
Good is one and bad also one,
kind may be different but meaning only one
What is continent and what is region?
Who is African and who is Asian?
What is Chilean and what is Nigerian?
Someone may come and say I am Serbian,
Not all religions but only human one,
Love them all and hate no one,
reject no one and extend embrace,
No love and hate but smiling only face
I continue to bow,
Lye always low,
Love to man and woman,
Oh, God, show me only one
Love and hate canâ€™t ever one,
sorrow and joy also not one,
poles remain apart and not called one,
Only HE may appear omni and look only one
