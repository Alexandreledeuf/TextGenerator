For two lovebirds, I met a Stratford on Avon
With the first initials D & T
They know who they are.
Love is a funny thing,
one minute you are up,
then the next you are down.
Then your head is spinning around,
your seeing stars,
dancing on the moon.
Love is a funny thing,
and that is for sure.
