I'm thinking of something Funny
And it looks a little Runny
I suppose it could be from someone's Nose
That the person never Blows
I'm thinking of something Funny
Could make your Day a little more Sunny
In Holland they say it rains like Cats and Dogs
But I say it rains like Cows and Hogs
Lets all Say,
A Joke a Day
Keeps the Doc. Away
P.S.
Please write something Funny
And you'll be my Friend, to the End
Well to the end of your Poem :)
