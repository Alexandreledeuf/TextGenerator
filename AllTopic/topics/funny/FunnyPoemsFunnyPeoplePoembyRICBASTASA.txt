we have friends who during a
party ask us
where have we been all these times
what we have been doing
on those spare days
and we answer that
we have been writing poems
and trekking the country for metaphors
and they all laugh while holding their wine glasses
thinking that we are joking
and finding us all
funny
'cheers! we'll drink to that' says a friend
to celebrate those days
when we merely talk about stocks and dividend
