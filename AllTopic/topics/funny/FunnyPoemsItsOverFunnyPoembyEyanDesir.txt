You broke my heart
So many times
Was he sweeter?
Is he better?
Was the grass greener?
On the other side?
Wipe your eyes
Please don't cry
You meet a monster
Clever like Dracula
Please don't bother me
I am eating lobster
With my brother
I hate your sorry lines
And the stupid lies
Get another guy
My love bye, bye
Shut the door
I need time to recover
Sorry it's over
(LOL Dedicated to Nef)
