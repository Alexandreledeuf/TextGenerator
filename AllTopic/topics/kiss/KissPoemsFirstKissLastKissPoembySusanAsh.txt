The warmth of his body
Flows through his touch,
Enfolding me in his universe.
I look deep
To catch a glimpse
Of his soul.
Feels he has already
Seen and taken
Possession of mine.
I drink in his breath,
A sweet nectar
Invading my body.
Melt in to him,
Eager surrender …….
Then disappointment.
They couldn’t
Match my ardour,
Didn’t understand it.
Wished I had
Feigned reluctance,
Been my seducers,
Felt special,
The conquerors.
He doesn’t know!
He was special.
Did seduce me,
Conquer me
Long ago ……
The first time
He looked
Into my eyes.
No forgiveness.
Aware of disapproval,
My passion rejected,
The moment is lost.
Already history.
