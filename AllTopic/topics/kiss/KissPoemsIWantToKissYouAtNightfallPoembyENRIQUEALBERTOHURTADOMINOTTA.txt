I want to kiss you at nightfall once again.
I want to kiss your lips tonight again
and taste the glory of your breath again.
I want to get drunk with the wine of your mouth
and to get lost in the unpublished ways of your soul.
I want to kiss your cheerful eyes at midnight once again
when the moon of the summer spills its light on the beach
and the soft rumor of the waves that die in the sand
whisper our names... smoothly.
I want to kiss your drowsy eyes under the light of first sunbeam
while the morning breeze wraps us slowly in a hug
in the solitude of our beach.
I want to fall asleep kissing you subtly another time
and wake up to half-day in the paradise of your embrace
and believe that I am still dreaming!
