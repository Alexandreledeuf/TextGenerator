That kiss, that kiss.
That kiss, that I do miss.
That love, that love.
Prettier than a dove.
That heart, that heart.
That heart, that shone like art.
Her hair, her hair.
It floated on the air.
That lie, that lie.
That lie, that made her cry.
The fool, the fool.
I was, to think it cool.
The knife, the knife.
That ended my life.
