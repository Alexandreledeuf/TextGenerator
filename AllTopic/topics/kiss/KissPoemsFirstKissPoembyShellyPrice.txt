Closed eyes can see,
lips upon lips.
Thoughts empty of resistence,
bodies filled with urgency.
Hunger turns into a beast,
without hesitation.
Closer than close,
lips brush lips.
Electricity surges,
lightning strikes the sky.
Tongues seductively dance,
harmonous with the sounds of lust.
Passion consumes,
lips tasting, feeling, teasing, yearning,
urgent to satisfy the starvation of time.
Tongues gently licking wet lips,
sucking.
Bodies are alive,
buring with heat.
All reason cast aside.
The sheer pleasure of a oneness,
feverish,  passionate, wanting more.
More pleasure,
more hot steamy,
wet tongues flickering.
Slowly parting gazing eye to eye,
the purist truths exposed.
Nothing hidden in the instant
that we first kissed.
