With an energy of love between our
Hands, fingers laced between the other.
That first touch of fire reveals the power
Starting to burst and starting to smother,
Tingling tightening, to squeeze off your air,
Blood rushes off to southern most parts,
Your scalp is alive with bumps in your hair,
Your face is reddened with a pounding heart,
Then he pulls you close and you feel the strength,
Of encircling arms around your waist,
Gently he presses, and kisses at length.
Then you look into his rugged soft face,
And smiling and giggling, at all this,
You try and savor your very first kiss.
