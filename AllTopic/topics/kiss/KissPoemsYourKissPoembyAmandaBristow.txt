I  can feel your magical touch,
when you kiss me,
I can feel your kiss,
With every bliss,
When you kissed me that afternoon,
I knew you were the one,
Your kiss, made everything right,
Although it scared me a tone,
Your kiss, swept me away,
Like a big powerful wave,
Your kiss, made my day,
I could feel you in every way,
Your kiss, was longed for,
It made me nervous,
Your kiss, lingered within,
It moved me,
Your kiss, remained in my thoughts,
Leaving me wanting more,
Your kiss, consumed me,
In one single moment.
