The soft plump faded pink lips
the green eyes looking deep
within the soul.
Friends for a year,
memories that would last a life
time.
Drooping my face towards the
stiff grey concrete.
Angles of today that are,
unheard of.
Never been kissed,
as the wet lips subside,
on there own.
Lonely and loosing love,
crackling the red heart within.
pain as it deteriates.
I want to take the heart beats from your body.
Fill in the gaps of the dried out heart.
catch you when you fall,
and be there when you need
someone to love youthe most.
your first wet smile,
to make yours greater in size.
The kiss you will remember and hold on to,
never letting go.
As i say i love you
you slip away
from me once and for all.
