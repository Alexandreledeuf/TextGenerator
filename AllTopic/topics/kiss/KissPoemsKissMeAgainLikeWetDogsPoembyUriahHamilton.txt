I love you in the rain
Walking lonely along the boulevard
Gazing at all the passing cars;
The glimmer of neon signs
Flash like batting eyes from drugstores.
Neither of us were ever concerned with crime,
Our thoughts were bathed in the sublime
As we made our way down dirty streets,
Somehow a paradise for the lost;
Kiss me again like wet dogs
Straying without hope
Blindly into the night.
You know my addiction for extinction
And everyway I tried to die;
We dug Kierkegaard as well as the philosophy
Of non-judgment and non-injury;
And the poetry of romantic defeat
Was oozing from my pores like sweat
And I was glad you were next to me
To relish the journey of splintered thoughts
Blooming into a bouquet of dangerous dreams.
