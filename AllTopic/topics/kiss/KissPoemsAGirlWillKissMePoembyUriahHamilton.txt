Deserted by love
In the summertime,
I walk by the river
And speak to seagulls
And feed them my sandwich.
I used to worship the dawn,
But now, I awake alone
In a dreamless home.
I fantasize a departure
To an exotic place
Where I’ll have a new
And lovelier face.
A girl will kiss me
Who doesn’t intend
To make me cry.
