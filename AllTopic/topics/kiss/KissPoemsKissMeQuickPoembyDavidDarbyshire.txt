Sounds very Simple to do,
To Kiss me Quick
But your Love must be True
And to catch me, is the Trick
When our lips do Meet
I know it will be such a Treat
For me as well as You
Nice and wet like the Morning Dew
Lips twisting and Turning
For more defiantly Yearning
And I'll probably want a Lot
Once I have Been Caught
