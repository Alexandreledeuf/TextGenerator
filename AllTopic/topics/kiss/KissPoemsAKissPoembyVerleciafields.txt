' A Kiss'
a kiss
is every so sweet
a gentle echo of elected
elegant manly lips
that elevate and evoke
the woman to reach
endlessly into her soul
and give her conventional
proof of love~
and with every breathe
she cease to exist
longing to fall back
into favor upon
that ever so wanted
kiss ~
