Here we are
Again in the circle
Our lives passing
Before our eyes
Somehow we’re
On the outside
Looking in
As someone else
Lives our lives
And there—
A kiss
From me to you
Only it’s not you
And it’s not me
Bodies don’t mean
Anything
Because the souls are
Misplaced and mislead
To a faraway land
Where dreams
Mingle and dance
With reality
And it’s not me and you
That live on the inside
We found the
Outside world
Of magick and drugs
Faerie wings and trolls
A place where sex
Isn’t sex
Not teenagers speeding
Up the path
To adulthood
But souls adjacent
And molding
