your northern smile embraces -
shining stars in the dimming sky
sparkles burst and pierce me
such brightness lightens my load
another day closes, sun sleeps
another night begins, stars keep
a hope of us together one day
across an ocean - now divides us
steps hasten screen door bangs
my chin lifts, eyes peering deep
this night is your day my sweet
slumber with fondest thoughts
our souls' yearning tendrils enlace.
