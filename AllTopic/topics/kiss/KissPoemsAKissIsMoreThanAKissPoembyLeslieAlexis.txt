If I were to stand in a pool of your tears
And found that my acts placed them there
Then love, my love… I would sink to hell.
Where there is life I would not dwell.
My heaven, sweet heaven, is in your smile,
And heaven’s beauty I wish not defile;
So, if my lips were to kiss one not your own,
I pray my head would fall off its bone
That it does not reach my heart of stone,
Which will rot as this virus spreads.
Instead of betraying your love, I rather be dead.
And if my hands were to hold her waist as done to yours,
My limps, every finger, I pray would be strewn
Upon the ground, for it is better if I were a thought,
Than to betray the one who gave me her heart.
Your heart I value much more than rain
On a desert journey of many years.
Thirst be thirst… to mine for you, nothing compares.
I long for you as a desert does for dew.
Knowing that which I receive is not from me,
I value your love; each day it gives jubilee.
Your kiss is more than a kiss, it is a sign,
And it says for eternity you will be mine.
And as your shadow does, I belong to you,
I love you.
