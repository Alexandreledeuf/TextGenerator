With wide open eyes, she looked at me,
And climbing up, upon my knee,
Gave me a kiss, which touched my heart
And launched a pain, as if a dart
Had entered my old ageing soul,
And found therein it's final goal!
She smiled and all the joy was mine,
A million stars shone by design,
And twinkled, my whole body, through,
Filling my being with life anew.
With that one kiss, we were as one
Together. Our lives had just begun.
