No one to stop you
Even you can’t deny
The world will miss you
But you can’t delay
You be gone forever
People remember your deeds
In our heart you will live forever
You will be always in our dreams
You have left our footprints
Prints of love in our heart
And will stay there till our end
Miserable I am, without my sweetheart
The only constant the only truth
To leave behind all you achieved
If you been here someday you have to leave
Everything it takes the kiss of death
The only constant, the only truth
Kiss of death, death it is……..
