The words i say today make the world fall away
The ring on your finger means your here to stay
The smile on your face lets me know you love me
When i wake up your the first thing i want to see
The look in your eyes make the world go away
The words we say makes my heart skip a beat
The bliss in this kiss is ever so sweet
With your hand in mine
Its not hard to find my very own piece of heaven
Were the angels fly happy and free
There i find you circled by these angles that sing
They sing a song
A melody of bliss in a kiss
Your kiss...
