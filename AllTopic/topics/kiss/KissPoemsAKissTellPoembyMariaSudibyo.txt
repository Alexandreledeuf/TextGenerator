I don’t care
I don’t dare
You’re not mine
But this time
You shouldn’t paint your lips
I shouldn’t find you sleep
You don’t give me a clue
You don’t even move
I just want to stop thinking you
And I get close to your hair
That shiny orange gloss has erased my mind
To forget your millions hate
I can’t escape
I take as mine
So stop the game
You know the end
You still witch queen
That cannot win
