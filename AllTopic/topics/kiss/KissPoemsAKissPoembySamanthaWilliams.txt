A kiss, simple though it seems!
A kiss, it is the stuff of dreams!
A kiss, contains the beauty of the world!
A kiss, can break the heart of this girl!
A kiss, is like an angel from above!
A kiss, can show all of my love!
A kiss, when it's from him is heaven!
A kiss, is that how it all begins?
A kiss, nothing could be more true!
A kiss, is perfect coming from you!
