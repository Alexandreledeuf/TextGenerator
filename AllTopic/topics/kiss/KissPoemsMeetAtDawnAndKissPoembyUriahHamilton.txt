The Loneliness is unrelenting
Like the endless stretch of highway
Leading to the city
Where you reside.
I drive weary hour
After weary hour,
The road signs blur,
Lost in the rain showers
Of my unhappy eyes.
I don’t know when
I’ll hold your hand
In a flowery field.
Currently, I’m climbing
Mountains of despair;
But one day,
We’ll meet at dawn and kiss.
