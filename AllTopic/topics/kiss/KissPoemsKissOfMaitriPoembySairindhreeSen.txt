Let heavens bear witness-
As two musk roses
Cross-pollinate in ecstasy,
Amidst showers of honey-dew.
Let the galaxy reverberate
With unalloyed bliss,
As the little mermaid whispers:
“My Kalyanamitra!
Close your eyes,
Sharpen your senses,
Its time;
Receive my kiss of maitri;
Here… I touch your soul!
Now …
Cherish your Nirvana…..!
O-o-o-o- m-m-m-m………
Shantih…Shantih…Shantih! ! !
