How na√Øve these mountains are
They are trying to kiss the sky
And feel that the clouds are a hindrance
Every time they make them fall on earth
Something grows and wishes are born
Now these mountains plea
O Sky bow down little and reach me
I want to kiss you like ~
The moonbeams kiss the sea
The bees kiss the flowers
And the waves kiss the shore.
