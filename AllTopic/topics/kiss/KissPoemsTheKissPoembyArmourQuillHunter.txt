What's in a kiss; how many there-be...?
'So many, it boggles the mind's reality…'
A kiss can be a greeting- “of body and soul-! '
It's an unspoken language, telling more than “what's told.”
It is sometimes “a spark-, ” to light one's flame…
Or often “self-flattery” to play one's game.
There's the 'kiss of friendship-, '
The 'kiss of guile…, '
The 'kiss of SINCERITY, '
The 'kiss of style…, '
There's the 'kiss of Life” and the 'kiss of Death! '
There's the 'kiss that steals one's breath away…”
And one “that prays it will last all day! ”
There's the 'kiss that frees the soul…'
Also one that 'detours from one's goal…! '
There's the kiss of a parent, the “kiss of a child…, ”
The “kiss of curiosity- running wild…! ”
The kiss of respect; and a kiss of shame…,
A kiss of honor- and “a kiss to tame…! ”
There's a kiss of the reserved-, “perceived amorous- (the same): ”
A kiss of 'the insecure-, ' to win their ball game!
There's a 'kiss of the stagnant; ' the 'kiss of the free…! ”
Also a 'kiss of those secure-, ” as the best there can be…
Yet what's in a kiss-, that's the question still…?
Maybe, it's how we perceive it to be-,
A reflection of “our state-of-mind…! ”
But; there's the kiss of harmony…
A kiss that divides…
A kiss that is honest…
And a kiss that hides….
There's a kiss of the clever…
A kiss of the mundane…
There's “a kiss like a symphony-, ” with rapturous refrain…!
There’s a plane where “Mercy and Truth meet intimately in bliss; ”
In the plumbline-address, where “Righteousness and Peace kiss! ”
Yet 'still-in-all-, ' maybe the question should be-,
Not 'what's in a kiss” but “what’s in the Kisser, ' you see…
