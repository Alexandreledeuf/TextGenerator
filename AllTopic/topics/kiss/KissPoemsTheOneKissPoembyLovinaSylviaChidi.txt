The one kiss
I ought to have dismissed
Is haunting me like an unsettled ghost
I felt a lingering sweetness in its taste
Enriched with sensuality and ripeness
I just refused to let it go to waste
The temptation to sample
The kiss of the forbidden apple
was there, out in open air
A kiss is not just a kiss
With my heart the kiss unlocked a door
I never knew was there before
Now I long for more and more
Wishing for everything to be like before
Presently my mind wanders without rest
Time has passed,
My mind still wanders without rest
To forget, I try to do my  best
My eyes which were once closed
Are now wide open
Searching, seeking, trying so hard to spot
The one kiss
I ought to have dismissed
