The woman full.
The sun it burns.
The earth when wet which scented smells.
Between the collums,
where you stood, I am.
Rising from the mud.
The squelch of sound is of.
The seaweed it is dark it grasps my feet.
Released divine all knowledge,
of some lighter secret?
Pulsing, pulsed it's forced, as it pours out.
Do you as other people touch that feeling?
What kind of sight, first night?
The love of wind is travelling through the air,
and the northern star,
the rainstorm, where the water it is sharp.
Two bodies which become.
Each depending on the others single sweetness.
Kissing you, I kiss the sky,
and by your kiss, I slip once more into the night.
