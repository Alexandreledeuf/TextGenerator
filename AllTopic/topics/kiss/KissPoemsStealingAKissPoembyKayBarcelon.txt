I like to watch you sleep
Sometimes you sigh
It makes my heart leap
your mouth slightly open
I canâ€™t resist touching your lips
Its softness gets me smitten
My lips moistened
I lean over to steal a kiss
Once again I was summoned
I get so close to your face
you are amazingly beautiful
I feel my heart starting to race
Feeling your warm breathing
Bringing a fever to my whole body
A tenderness I am yearning
Suddenly you awakened
Smiling like I was expected
And the rest is what I have envisioned
