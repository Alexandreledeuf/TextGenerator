I will kiss you
good night
good morning
good day
when you open your eyes
when you close them again
I will kiss you
lips exploring textures untested
new tastes, new temptation
probing, delicious and sweet
dancing, delighting
teasing
I will kiss you
as you feast upon my love
as you consume my body
let me fill you with my joy
then,
I will kiss you again.
