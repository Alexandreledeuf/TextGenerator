You've got me burning
My mind's wheels keep turning
No matter how hard I've tried
I always find myself tongue tied
mmm tongue tied with yours
my libido soars
touching you, touching me
you're all that I see
lying naked in my bed
can't get that image out of my head
kiss me, touch me,
feel me, want me
I can still smell your scent
and all my energy's spent
trying really hard not to care
yet I still feel your fingers in my hair
My hair draped over your face
it wasn't the time or place
me on top of you
it was all I could do
to not melt
from the ecstasy I felt
Kiss you, touch you
feel you, want you
