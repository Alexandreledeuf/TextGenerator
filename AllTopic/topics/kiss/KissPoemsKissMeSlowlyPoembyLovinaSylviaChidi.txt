Kissing is an art, one most master
Kissing slowly is better than faster
Kiss me slowly
Kiss me tenderly
Kiss me sweetly
Kiss me on the lips
Down to my finger tips
Delicately sample my nipples
Kiss it, tease it, rather simple
When done right, let me be precise
Kissing itself can be rather very nice
Kiss me slowly
Kiss me tenderly
Kiss me sweetly
Kiss my body inch by inch
Till it tickles and starts to flinch
Kiss me in the left and right ear
Whisper sweet words of passionate care
Kiss me by the neck
With little kisses called pecks
Kiss me hungrily in the mouth
Hear my groaning delicious shouts
Kiss me below and yonder
Till my juices begin to ponder
And turn on fire with desire
Kiss me slowly
Kiss me tenderly
Kiss me sweetly
Kiss me once, twice, thrice
Oooo! These kisses are very nice
