It was a late november night
I remember it well
We went to the movies
In Russelville
My parents drove and
in the back we cuddled
When we dropped you off
And I walked you to the door
We Kissed
It was a shy awkward kiss
but one that i'll remember
because in it I felt a promise
From God to me
That you and I will always be
together
since then theres been other kisses
some more passionate and loving
some more meaningful and romantic
but nothing can beat that first time
when our two lips met
it was one second of our time
but it'll last for eternity
