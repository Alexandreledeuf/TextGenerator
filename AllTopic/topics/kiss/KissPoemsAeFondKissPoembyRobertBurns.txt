1     Ae fond kiss, and then we sever;
2     Ae fareweel, and then forever!
3     Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,
4     Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee.
5     Who shall say that Fortune grieves him,
6     While the star of hope she leaves him?
7     Me, nae cheerfu' twinkle lights me;
8     Dark despair around benights me.
9     I'll ne'er blame my partial fancy,
10   Naething could resist my Nancy;
11   But to see her was to love her;
12   Love but her, and love forever.
13   Had we never lov'd sae kindly,
14   Had we never lov'd sae blindly,
15   Never met--or never parted--
16   We had ne'er been broken-hearted.
17   Fare thee weel, thou first and fairest!
18   Fare thee weel, thou best and dearest!
19   Thine be ilka joy and treasure,
20   Peace. enjoyment, love, and pleasure!
21   Ae fond kiss, and then we sever;
22   Ae fareweel, alas, forever!
23   Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,
24   Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee!
