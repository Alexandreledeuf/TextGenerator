Skinned knees
Aching bellies
An Ankle sprain;
Mother, your one kiss was enough
To drive all the pain away
Time and again.
Depression striken
At crossroads
Groping for answers
Mother, your one kiss was enough
All dilemmas it did unchain
Time and again.
Unfulfilled promises
Soured friendship
Broken heart, ;
Mother can your kiss fix everything?
Can it mend these broken strings
Can it repair my hurt feelings?
Kiss me today mother,
Be my anchor of strength & hope.
Help me get through the onerous times
Help me handle the matters of mind and heart
Help me break away from these teenage trappings
Kiss me today mother, help me make a start.
