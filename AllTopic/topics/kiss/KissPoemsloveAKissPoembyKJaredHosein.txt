A kiss down by the riverside,
When the waterspouts
Comes to life
And across the evergreen glide.
A kiss with your mouth open wide,
With noses nuzzling
And lying on a foliage mattress
With nothing to hide.
A kiss beneath the harvest moon,
In the wheat and the rye,
When pixies spiral to an eventide rune
'Til the morning Phoenix soars by.
A kiss during a fiery noon
In the fields of midday bloom
And so sings the loon
While petals rise from the gloom.
A kiss, for birds to sing,
For the winter to turn to spring
An exchange of bliss,
A kiss,
To melt a world of snow
In one breath of warm mist.
