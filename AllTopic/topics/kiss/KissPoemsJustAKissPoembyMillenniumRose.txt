It was just a Kiss
A harmless little Kiss
But it was so tender & so sweet
I completely succumbed
To your charms as they unfolded I wanted to Kiss and Kiss again
Oh the magic of it all
How was I to know when it began
That I would definitely fall in love forever
And we vowed we'd part absolutely positively NEVER
Oh the magic of just a Kiss
