‘Twas Spring in a desert town
Chill was in the evening air
Desert land bare and brown
I'd longed to see my lady fair
Dressed all in black
She tapped softly at my door
She still possessed a knack
To shake me to my core
Dinner for two at some quiet place
Where time once more stood still
Rekindled love set hearts to race
Life held no greater thrill
We shook hands, said good bye
I chanced “A Stolen Kiss”
Then gone the magic moment
of our romantic bliss...
