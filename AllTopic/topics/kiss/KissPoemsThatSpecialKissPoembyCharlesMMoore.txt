Let me kiss that special kiss
the one that's more than touch
that gentle pressing of the lips
persuading blood to rush
The kiss that makes you tremble
and makes your legs go weak
a moist embrace of tenderness
that takes you to your peak
With a heady scent of passion
It makes your body sway
the kiss that penetrates your soul
and takes your breath away
It lingers for a lifetime
you never will forget
the bursting of your senses
when our emotions met.
