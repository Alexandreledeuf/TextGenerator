Clip clop, clip clop...
Drizzle kisses the parched earth.
By the garlands of glee,
A dreamy eye welcomes thee.
Somnolent crops rejuvenate,
And rejoice in thy mellifluous tune.
Sweep afar then,
Doleful moments...
Which has smeared...
Every sweating forehead,
With paste of famine,
Drought and poverty…
And left everything,
A complete dust bowl…
Clip clop, clip clop...
Drizzle kisses the parched earth.
