spring is a -springing
the sun is a-shining
and daffodils dance in the dew of the garden
horses are necking
and neighing and whinnying
and chasing each other all over the paddock
birds are a-nesting
and preening and strutting
about with their feathers all ruffled and polished
children are laughing
their faces exploding
with smiles and giggles and games of pretending
lovers are lusting
and cooing and kissing
and dreaming of yellow and sunshine and flowers
