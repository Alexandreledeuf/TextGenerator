The moon whispers a sweet lullaby to an audience
Of starlets in the morning sky
Soft breezes uncover the layer of my happiness
Lazy clouds of grey melt in the sunshine of our love.
Memories of a lost childhood become reality.
We share a special melody that embraces us in a dream.
Your presence warms the coldest days
When I cannot be with you.
It ignites the sacred hearth within my fragile soul
And strengthens my undying devotion to you.
You fill my cup of passion
When I see the twinkle in your eye.
My life is complete.
Come share of my joy.
