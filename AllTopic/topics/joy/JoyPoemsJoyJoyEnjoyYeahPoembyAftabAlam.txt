Joy- joy, enjoy; yeah,
Joy- joy, enjoy
Your prayers,
Your worship, ahoy!
Joy- joy, enjoy; yeah,
Joy- joy, enjoy
There lit, God’s house,
Yonder, a darken hut,
There a feast,
Foods spilled all over,
Yonder, children waiting,
Waiting for dry bread,
Don’t coy—
Joy- joy, enjoy; yeah,
Joy- joy, enjoy
Those need. Indeed
We scared with money,
Fun and fun—so funny
Come and be liberal
Nourish and cherish
The living skeleton
Drought on body
Skinny, bone thorny
Just living,
Just breathing,
Just waiting,
Became a decoy,
Joy- joy, enjoy; yeah,
Joy- joy, enjoy
Lord is ashamed on us with our act,
Fooling the Lord, no prayer in fact
