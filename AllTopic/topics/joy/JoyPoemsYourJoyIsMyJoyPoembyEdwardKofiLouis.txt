Your joy is my joy!
And, your laughter heals my soul.
The city of songs,
The smile on your face heals my heart;
The city of music!
Your laughter is like medicine to my heart;
Friendship should have rules and,
Everybody should obey them.
The future is with the influence of your life today,
So, you can change your life for the better is you want to;
Loon, loom!
True-love is with the wonder formula of life;
Your joy is my joy and,
Your laughter heals my soul.
