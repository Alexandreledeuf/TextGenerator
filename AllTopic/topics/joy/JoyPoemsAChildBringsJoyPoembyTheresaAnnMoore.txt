All the time in the world
Can never be as precious
As the years your child grows
It is a luxury of the ambitious
Although minutes are impounded
With things that must be done
Chores and working for a dollar
Should not eliminate the fun
Children are a marvel to observe
Each moment becomes more satisfying
Even when the days are challenging
Rewards of success are gratifying
When the hours of budding have dissolved
An adult emerges and comprehends
With joy and laughter, remembering whenâ€¦
The moments continue to give dividends
