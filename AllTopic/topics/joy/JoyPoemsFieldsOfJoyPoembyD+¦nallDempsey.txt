I see you
coming through these fields of joy
through the blaze of wheat
lost in
this shimmering heat
haze
with & without
form
now a scarlet dress
now nothing but a flame
burning
in the distance
my heart
flaming with desire
at the thought of the touch of your hand
the ordinary everyday miracle of your smile
transforming itself into the mystery of your kiss
I see you
coming through
my fields of joy
a red flame
disguising itself
as a woman
shimmering through wheat
my heart lost
in this haze of heat
my voice
erases
the distance
closes down
the distance
longing for
the nearness
of your nearness
my words
set free to the sky
fly
into the shape
that birds would make
if they could write:
“I love you! ”
across this blue
you
waving
waving
at my voice
