Is it possible?
Can it be done?
To capture Joy
Loves smile begun
Tender hands
Safe and secure
Memories of home
Love is here, and more
Joy open and unafraid
Sharing and caring
Begotten not made
Smiling hearts
Abounding love
Free at last, to be
A child of God above
Love is here, and more
To have and to hold
Joy in mothers eyes
Tender security
In fathers sighs
Contentment revealed
In a moment of Joy
Captured in the heart
Of ever girl and boy
Can Joy be captured
I wonder if it can
Joy a transforming miracle
In the eyes of Sam and Dan
The heart of joy in wonder
In whispered smile above
Love is here, and more
Treasure the joy of Love.
