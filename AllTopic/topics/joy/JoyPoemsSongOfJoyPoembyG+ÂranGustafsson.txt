Tune up your strings in harmony
Strike up your song of joy
And learn the music, let it sound
Stand up and sing your song
When birds begin to sing their song
You know the night has gone
When all the shadows have withdrawn
You know the day has dawned
And then be pleased, you living one
To see the morning sun
Be pleased to see the newborn smile
And know that life worthwhile
Be pleased to feel the morning dew
And life being born anew
Be pleased to touch your lover's heart
And know you'll never part
Be pleased to hear all nature sings
A hymn to you it brings
With notes and chords of sacred vow
To be the eternal Now
Tune up your strings in harmony
Strike up your song of joy
And learn the music, let it sound
Stand up and sing your song
