I wanted to say hello to some cyber-friends,
poets and commenters who stopped by to
send an encouraging word; wonderful
people who refrain from criticism as they
know how it hurts – yet never hold back
their praise when their hearts are touched
But Internet connection is so bad -
it refuses to allow me to reply tonight,
when I read a poem and click to comment,
the computer coldly informs me that it
cannot (will not? refuses to? !)   open
that site, forget your request
I’m doing my best to stay calm -
but I’ve lost it – I feel like killing the
bloody machine! - so to one and all;
please forgive if I don’t mention your
name; the bloody machine takes too long
I can’t look again – and the old memory
is clogged by thoughts murderous and angry –
Elmer and Goldy Locks; Tara, Patti, Sue, Max Reif,
Chris, Zen, Theo and Marci Made – and all whose
names I could not look up before losing my mind;
thank you for saying hello; I’m fine tonight - though
I hate my PC and the Internet - and now am
Convinced it hates me – I’ve decided you are
all figments of my imagination; as unreachable
as Mount Everest, but as wonderful as the best
dream; your presence became a vision to me –
thank you all for entering my dreams and being
part of an imaginary scheme of cyber-entities
Though the evil bewitched machine won’t allow
me to link with you; though I have to withdraw
from the world and live within myself; though
at work there is no time to forge bonds, I am
deliciously delighted by your poetry and your
PoemHunter presence; Monday I’ll try again
To steal some time to link up - until then;
all the best, enjoy your rest, may the weekend
be fun, may you have adventures and challenges
enough to keep you happy and fighting fit; may
your PC’s and Internet connections bring you more
joy - than mine has bloody well done!
