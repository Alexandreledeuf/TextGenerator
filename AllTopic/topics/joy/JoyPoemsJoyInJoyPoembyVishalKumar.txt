God has created everything in twain
Life - Death
Love - Hate
Joy - Pain
And
Now i crave for the other side
Cuz everything has its joy
Joy has its joy
And
Even pain has its joy
But what everyone looks for
Is the joy of joy
But i seek for the pain
The Sweetness in Pain
Pain in Silence
Silence in Loneliness
Loneliness in Joy
Cuz everything has its Joy!
Joy in joy can only be stong
If after the aeons of pain
A ray of mirth shines
So joy is even incomplete without pain, sorrow etc.
And so i plead to God
Fill my soul with bitterness
Fill my life with Pain
And rest of the quest
I will search my self
