The  only  things  of  value
Contained  in  God's  array,
Are  found  in  those  few  moments
When  love  is  on  display.
The  precious  little  seconds
When  lovers  realize
The  joy  and  satisfaction
They  see  in  each  ones  eyes.
The  words  that  pass  in  whispers,
That  shiver  down  the  spine,
The  yearning  for  each  other
That  seems  almost  divine.
It's  when  such  moments  linger,
Those  moments  of  romance;
That  all  life  finds  its  value
In  just  one  loving  glance.
We  all  dream  of  such  moments.
Why  then,  are  they  so  rare?
It  seems  we'd  rather  harbor  love,
Than  spread  it  here  and  there.
We've  shed  our  tears  of  sorrow.
What's  left  are  those  of  joy.
A  strategy  of  loving
Is  what  we  should  employ.
Hug  the  ones  you  cherish,
Just  kiss  and  hold  them  tight.
Do  what  you  have  yet  to  do,
But  always  thought  you  might.
Remember,  lifetimes  numbers
Are  found  on  every  crown.
I  wonder  why  you're  waiting,
The  rain  is  pouring  down.
And  if  you  have  nobody,
Don't  make  this  poor  excuse.
Just  ask,  and  you'll  find  someone
Prepared  to  set  love  loose.
All  souls  should  be  companioned.
Two  hearts  should  beat  as  one.
Two  lips  should  feel  the  passion
Of  kisses,  every  one.
Four  eyes  should  see  the  beauty.
Four  hands  should  gently  feel.
And  tears  of  joy,  when  falling;
Is  love,  both  true  and  real.
For  each  of  us,  though  strangers,
Still  seek  love  as  our  goal.
As  God  wished  His  creations
To  join  as  just  one  soul.
However  you  may  find  it,
No  matter  for  how  long,
There  is  no  love  created
By  two  that  can  be  wrong.
So  have  as  your  endeavor,
His  calling  from  above.
The  spread  of  God's  creation.
The  Wondrous  Joy  Of  Love.
