When we were but a babe
taking our first, little wobbly baby steps.
Our parents applauded and beamed with joy
with outreached arms, they stretched.
Then with time we raised our own
and when they stepped out, you praised.
Always there, to bring them up safely
and instilling  them, with standards raised.
In those little blessed first steps
was a joy we've seemed, to have forgotten or lost.
We don't seem to find, or see our blessings
in the baby steps we now walk.
Where is that joy and excitement?
We should all be walking in everyday?
They're just a bigger stride we're taking
but in a baby first step, stepping way.
One step closer to our Father's arms
which are outstretched just for you!
To catch you if you fall from grace
and make things, all the new.
Reminded of your first child's steps
and the ones you are taking now.
Just know that God the Father and Son
are there, supporting your walking now.
