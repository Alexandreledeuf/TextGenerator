I love the way you take my hand and
Lead me through the lane,
It's amazing how you make me laugh
So don't fell the pain.
A mother's love is the strongest type and
This you cannot deny,
Thank you for always being my light
You are the perfect guide.
I've never thought about much
'I love you' really means.
You've always found the time to listen
To my highs, lows and in betweens
I'll never really understand how
You have the energy to care,
There is no doubt about it I'll always respect
The joy you have to share.
