If you want to make noise.
Make the noises of joy!
If you want to make noise,
Make the noises of joy!
They less annoy.
Too many backsliders on a ride,
That has driven many right out of their minds.
Too many entwined with crime,
That mankind finds and blinds!
There seems more hopelessness surviving.
More folks who are conniving in slime.
Just to have a pity party with those who tit for tat!
