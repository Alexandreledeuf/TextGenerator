Love is flying so high wind is here.
Balloons fly on a beautiful windy day.
You took a part of my heart. Your memories fly
In the sky so high with love filling the air with joy and love. Joy is here love is flying
So high.    My Life Is You  You wrote your name in my heart. Because you
say you still love me so much. I Love you to.
To let this beautiful love go out of my lift. My
lift is you. I want to be. My love is you that
I could never forget your true love for me.
I have found my true love.
