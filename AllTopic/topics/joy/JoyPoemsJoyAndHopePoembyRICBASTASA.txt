Joy calls
She needs help she pleads
And I answer
Where and when
I do not bother
About why
I could be unethical
For my left hand
Must learn to give
Without my right
Hand knowing
And Hope comes next
Waiting at the Capitol
What a coincidence
She likes a hitch ride too
She needs help
Her heart is broken
And need immediate repair
I have this flashy car
With space enough for two
Or more
How can a man
Sane still
Refuse to give the best
Ride for lovely lonely women
Like them?
To err is human
But to make love is divine
And so Iâ€™ll go
What happens next
I will not tell you
Wait! My cell phone is ringing
It is Charity again calling!
