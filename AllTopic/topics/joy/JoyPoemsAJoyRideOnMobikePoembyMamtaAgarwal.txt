Arms around your waist,
And hairflying in the air,
That first joyride on mobike
On Delhi roads sealed our fate.
A lot can happen over coffee,
The best in town you will find,
As we walked hand in hand
Through a plush hotel lobby.
As we sat, you said say yes now,
What, we have just met, I protest.
I know for sure, it’s destined
Please just don’t ask me how.
Love at first sight,
I laughed out loud,
Happens in Mills and Boon,
As we slipped out at night.
I said yes the very next day
Still fills me with disbelief.
Like a hero of romantic movies
You were charming in so many ways.
Now the mobike is gone,
And we travel side by side,
In a luxury air conditioned car.
To  town, to work every morn.
In silence we drive, preoccupied
Hands on lap, hair in place,  I see
A couple on a speeding bike,
And think of that first joyride…
