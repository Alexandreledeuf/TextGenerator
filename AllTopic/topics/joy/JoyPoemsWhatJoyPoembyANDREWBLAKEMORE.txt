What joy has filled my empty heart
For so long starved of love,
My spirit floating through the air
And on the clouds above.
What joy has come to me at last
When all my hope had gone,
For finally my luck has changed
And fortune now has shone.
What joy when all I had was lost
Alone and poor was I,
But now my future seems so clear
Just like the summer sky.
What joy has filled my empty heart
Now it does sing for thee,
The love for which I'd waited long
Shall last eternally.
