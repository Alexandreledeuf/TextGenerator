I love to  spend, stay and live in the sea
MEGGIE, the mermaid they loved to call me
With all the beautiful corals and fishes
These are my life's simple joy, you see
Collecting sea shells, big and small
In my small room i have it all
Consider it a  blessing
My entire life, i give thanks.and oh... i wanted to sing
Come and  see my favorite things
When the sky is blue, and i am feeling low
I  go back to see this place i know
And spend my whole life through
note: I spent my  entire younger days swimming in the sea
and my cousins fondly called me, 'Meggie the mermaid' he he.
thank you for any nice comment. Shalom!
