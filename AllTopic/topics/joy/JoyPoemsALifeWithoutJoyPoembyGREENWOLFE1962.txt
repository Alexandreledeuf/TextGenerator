I  think  I'm  going  to  make  it  through,
It's  been  so  long  you  see;
There's  much  more  life  behind  me  now
Than  out  in  front  of  me.
There  was  a  time,  when  not  so  sure;
I  thought  to  end  it  then.
I  didn't  see  how  one  could  live
Without  much  joy  and  win.
But  I  found  out  you  can  endure
Without  a  special  one.
And  after  all,  it  must  be  said;
Of  fate,  what's  done  is  done.
And  so  I  choose  to  carry  on
With  life  and  burdens  bore.
I  hope  if  I  can  carry  these,
God  may  not  give  me  more.
But  if  He  did,  I  hope  He'd  grant,
My  just  one  simple  plea;
To  end  my  life  with  one  great  love
Who'd  bring  great  joy  to  me.
So  now  I'm  near  the  end  of  life,
My  joyless  days  near  done.
I'd  lie  if  I  would  dare  to  say,
I  never  did  have  fun.
But  what  is  true,  and  that's  the  rub,
Of  life,  don't  you  agree;
Is  love  is  really  what's  required,
For  joy  to  be  set  free?
So  on  it  is  with  what  remains,
I  hope,  not  very  long;
Of  life,  perhaps  to  know  great  love,
If  it  should  come  along.
And  as  I  go  my  separate  way,
I'll  not  begrudge  their  joy;
If  others  feel  what  I  once  felt,
When  I  was  just  a  boy.
Instead  I'll  smile  and  just  recall
The  joy  I  felt  back  then.
And  know  that  I'll  feel  soon  enough
Love's  wondrous  joy  again.
