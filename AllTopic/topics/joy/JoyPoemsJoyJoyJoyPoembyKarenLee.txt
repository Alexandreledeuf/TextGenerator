The melody of the tune
Joy! Joy! Joy! Joy!
Joy! Joy! Joy! Joy!
Joy! Joy! Joy! Joy!
Joy!
Base
Alto
Soprano
Someone always missed the tune
We all laugh
At the end of that song
Joy!
Joy!
Joy!
The sopranos sang
We kept going
It seems so long
I smiled
All the way through this song
We all smiled
When we sang this one
It is the season of joy!
Let, joys rang
Like a bell
It prolong
Joy! Joy! Joy! ...
