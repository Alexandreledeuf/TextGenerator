A memory or two
Returning...reappearing
Surprisingly entering our hearts again
Not the same...always rearranged
Haunting and intriguing
Living and dying
Pushing and pulling
Remembering togetherness
Moments of shared hearts
In the midst of isolation
Remembering that we were
Not alone
No longer applying
Such long forgotten
Traces of feeling and thought
Never again will our lives
Be as they were
A future uncertain...
With unknown duration
Past reflected as if present
Selecting each moment
Wondering...searching for meaning
Past changing...as the future
Takes hold of us
