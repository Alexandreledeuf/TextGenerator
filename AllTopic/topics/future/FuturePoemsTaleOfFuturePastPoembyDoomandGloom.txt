As mountains dwell in timeless sleep, as seasons come and go
As oceans roll across the deep, as forests slowly grow
An evil has been gathering, a dark age has begun
All life on earth shall rue this day, the time of man has come
With axe and pick that chop and chip, the land shall be stripped bare
With fire and steel, that burn and deal a death to all who care
With hate and greed, that fuel and feed the coming of the end
Into a fate consumed with hate our world will now descend
As mountains wake, roar and quake, as seasons loose their sway
As oceans rise to turn the tide, and forests die away
A giant is awakening, a cleansing will ensue
All life on earth shall rue this day; the debt of man is due
With rock and flame that smash and maim, life shall be erased
With flood and wave, that drowns and paves a path to deaths embrace
Mother earth begins again, but none remain to tell
That the balance is precarious, between paradise and hell
