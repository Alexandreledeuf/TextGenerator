I sit me down to think and write,
How to lead my Future Life,
Knowing it’s set by HIM alone,
But I don’t want to remain at Home.
For forty years I’ve toiled at work,
Difficult tasks I’ve not shirked,
But at Sixty Two I’ve more years to learn,
And from difficulties, I will not squirm.
But what will I do?
What will I learn?
Will I be happy?
For answers I yearn.
I wish to change my Life,
Be Happy and Well,
Have Peace of Mind,
Before the Final Bell.
I’m ‘Set in my Ways’,
I acknowledge that fact,
But change my Life I must,
With Discretion and Tact.
