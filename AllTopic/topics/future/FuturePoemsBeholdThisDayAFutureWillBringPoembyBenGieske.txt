Behold this day a future will bring.
Snow is quietly gracing the ground.
There will then just be a silent sound.
Will it be one of which we will sing?
Tonight we’ll be skating on the pond.
By the cracking fire we’ll coddle round.
Each and ev’ry one will form a bond.
There will then just be a silent sound.
No recipe is ours to follow
Flitting in the night with the swallows.
Around and around we’ll make a ring.
Perhaps a song or two we will sing.
The ice smooth and glistening will be.
Expecting others with eagerness.
Some happiness there surely will be.
We’ll be snug like birds in a nest.
