You are my sole hope in all my life.
The last dejection has gone away
When I met you on that very day.
All the troubles are completely gone;
From now on, I am no more alone.
You are my sole hope in all my life,
My all reason to live – my future wife.
Living and hoping to still keep you
By my heart and soul – and it's for true,
My all reason to live, my future wife.
I'd love to live by your side to death,
And take away, for you, my last breath.
I can be everything when you are near,
And leave behind any issues; my dear.
You are my sole hope in all my life,
You've really made me the man I am,
And got me head over heels out of jam
– My all reason to live, my future wife.
You are my sole hope in all my life,
My all reason to live – my future wife.
