Every one wants to be different
Yet every one looks the same
This fashion industry drives me insane
The hip hip kiddies on the street
Thinking that they listen to something new and neat
We are all turning into sheep
Driven by the 'industry'..
One day I see a million clones
All walking wearing the same boring clothes
All using the same products!
A scary future where the industry has run amuck
“To the future” I say and “good luck”
