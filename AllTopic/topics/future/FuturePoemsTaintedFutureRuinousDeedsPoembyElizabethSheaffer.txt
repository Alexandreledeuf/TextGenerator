Your fingertips graze across my skin...
Soft lips gently caress my warm flesh...
Exquisite pleasure building within...
A sinful lust you can't hold back...
Body aching to capture, release...
Coming together in waves of need...
A hectic rhythm that just won't cease...
Our sinful lust we can't hold back...
Fingers, nails, digging deep...
Hoarse whispers fill the air with sound...
In blissful escape together we weep...
In sinful lust we couldn't hold back...
Two months later, a small surprise...
Adding to a list of troubles...
One night, and a future of baby's cries...
It was sinful lust that ruined our lives.
(I feel the need to note that I do not have a child.  I chose a random subject, namely sex, and this was the turn that it took.  I don't really feel this way. kthx.)
