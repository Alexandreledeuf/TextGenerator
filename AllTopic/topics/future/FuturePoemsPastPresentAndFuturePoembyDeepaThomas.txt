Sitting in my garden chair
Surrounded with little flowers
Breeze tenderly touching
And lending a new feel
Brooding over the past
Thinking about wins and failures
About the people walked out
About the things not done
Getting away with present
No time to stop and think
Just doing, doing and doing
Just what is necessary today!
Hoping for the future
Dreaming of new horizons
About that special someone
And how life will change
