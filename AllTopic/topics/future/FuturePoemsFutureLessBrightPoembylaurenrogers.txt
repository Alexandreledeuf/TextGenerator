the world beyond our shameless eyes
is drowning more than we can see
where money is what cheating buys
but never seems to grow on trees
tomorrow's dreams of yesterday
have dissipated in the heat
of poisons and ozone decay
while houses crumble in the street
our lives drone on repeatedly
toiling toward some unknown end
forlorn attempts die feebly
to fix what time itself can't mend
the government is fraudulent
and slightly skewed toward tyrany
what they say and what they meant
shout greed and mass hypocrisy
and for the future we invest
no questions asked, no answers raised
about the past we joke and jest
yet disregard the present days
but who's to blame, and who's to say?
why should the 'Land of Liberty'
or any other nation pay
for crimes of all humanity?
