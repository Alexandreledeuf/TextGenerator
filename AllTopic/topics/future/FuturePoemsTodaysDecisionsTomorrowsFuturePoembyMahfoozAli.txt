Forgetting all my care
Soaking the night's air
As I sit in the gentle breeze
It almost brings me to my knees.
Finally seeing what Allah had in store,
I look and I listen at creation galore.
When I think of the different types of love,
It moves me to help create a solution.
What will happen in ten years or more,
If we pass off the problems or simply ignore?
The happiness we had today will turn into sorrow,
So pitch in and help for a better tomorrow.
