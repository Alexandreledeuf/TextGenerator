From the outset I must state
Old men (especially these!)  and (some)  women
Are not in me to hate
And thunderstorm I pray them not to strike
Because that is where I am headed
You all know and can certainly see
The truth, so by Amadiora may I not be beheaded
Most if not at all all offices around
Have sleepy octogenarians sleeping on the job
Waking up to remind me that my turn will come round
In the future, not near, not far- somewhere there
I am future leader you see
And so was my father before me
Who in that moment of despondency
Took to changâ€™aa- the local gin
Searching for hope in there- such futility!
Trying to discover the future in him
Unfortunately, he died of the liver disease
When he was about to be the future leader
Sort of!
All the while the increasingly old man and woman
Through press release s and conferences
Promised him and me as well
That we were leaders of tomorrow
What tomorrow I will ask not for now I know
Perhaps I should be like that Obama boy
Seizing the moment to bring the needed change
