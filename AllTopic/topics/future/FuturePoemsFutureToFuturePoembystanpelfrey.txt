in the future moments will
come when one person says
to another, “That was great! ”
we never know what
the future holds in store
for us-in it’s infinite
wisdom-but surely you and I
know of it’s impending arrival
some believe the future
holds great times ahead,
some believe in a bleak
fate and still others believe
unborn moments hold
a catastrophic end
me, I like to think that
maybe, just maybe, it
will all happen at the same
instance-I mean some things
will be great, some bleak,
some beginnings and some endings
“great” things will only
happen in the future, because
of now, and that’s tough enough
to decipher-so I will plead, now,
and leave the future to the future
