The soul it seeks to perch and pray
A tune that renders fine
Without a stop when started forth
It hopes to sing a line
With feathers wafting at its crest
Like hornets in its nest
In storm and lightning thunderous sounds
Appeal to all in zest
The warmth that beats within the chest
Is hard concealed to spin
But in the cold and on the seas
Its surely bound to win
