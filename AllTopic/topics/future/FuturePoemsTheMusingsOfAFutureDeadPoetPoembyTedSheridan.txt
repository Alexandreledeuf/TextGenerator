You do not
confuse me
you only confound
the issues.
I am not taken back
by your ignorance
only slightly
delayed by it
as I struggle
to understand
why I should care.
I am weakened
by my sense
of humanity
not by my love for it...
for my love
is the one true strength
that keeps you
from destroying me
as I pause
to consider
any possible
method to your madness......
