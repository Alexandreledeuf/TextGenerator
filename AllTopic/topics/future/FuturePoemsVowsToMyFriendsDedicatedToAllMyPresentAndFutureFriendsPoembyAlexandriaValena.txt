I will always love my friends,
Forever or until my life ends.
I will treat them with respect,
Even when long days make me feel like a tiny speck.
I vow to hug them tight,
When nothing seems to be going right.
I propmise to be true,
Because there is nothing better i can do.
I promise to open up,
To those of them that feel beat up!
My friends, i can keep a secret,
Im the one you can tell and not feel regret.
These are the vows to my friends,
I promise to love you till the end.
