I've had a good innings time has left me gray
The future belongs to the youth of today
Allow them their passion for time hurries by
As life is for to live well and for to enjoy,
Our biological time clocks on our lives are ticking away
And though wisdom comes with ageing some are known to say
And though credit should be given to whoever it's due
No fool like an old fool can also be true,
Allow the youth their passion allow them to dream
Though reality in their eyes may not be what it seem
In the eyes of a child one in their twenties is one who looks old
We believe all we see but not all we are told
And though for saying it many may say of me that I am wrong
The youth to the future will always belong.
