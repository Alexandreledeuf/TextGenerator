I think about the future,
And I wonder about our life.
To much hate for one planet,
To much fear.
Somehow,
I missed the announcement
That love had died,
I missed her funeral,
I hope it was nice.
Lost;
The masses cling to faith,
While the homeless
Cling to paper sacks,
Filled with empty dreams,
Fading, like old yellow newspapers,
In the rain.
In the future,
There will be a day,
When life
Will be worth more than greed;
And paper sacks,
Are just paper sacks.
I hope it comes soon.
