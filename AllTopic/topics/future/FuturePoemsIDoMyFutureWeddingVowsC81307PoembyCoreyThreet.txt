This is a letter from me to you
To let you know that truly I do
But the words I say cannot be used freely
So this letter is telling you that I do really
I do vow to do the dishes when ever you are sick
and I do vow to get medicine from the pharmacy quick
I do vow to keep you in your wonderful dream house
and I do vow if that can't happen you'll never see a mouse
I do vow to give you all the kids you need
and I vow if you don't want to I'll take the lead
I do vow to give you the best anniversaries you ever wished
and I do vow if we leave your parents will be missed
I do vow that I will love for all of my life
So I say I do to you being my lawfully wedded wife
