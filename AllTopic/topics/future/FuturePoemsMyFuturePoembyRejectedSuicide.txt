today i cry myself to sleep
tomorrow i still just weep
next week, my spiral still goes down
feeling like a big clown
not knowing where i'll end up...
i panic, trying to save money but,
losing it to too many bills
next month, will i be over the hill?
or living in my car?
or working at the Nevada bar?
it scares me to think about it
i dont like my life one bit
wishing i'd be hit by a truck
but i dont have such good luck
today i cry myself to sleep
tomorrow is still just weep
next week my sprial still goes down.
Next month...it scares me not to know.
