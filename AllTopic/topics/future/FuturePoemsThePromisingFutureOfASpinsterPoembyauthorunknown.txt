It's frightening.
I feel better,
but I'm longing for a kiss.
One simple kiss
or maybe
not so simple.
I just want someone
to hold me when
the nights are empty.
Or maybe when I am
Far away, someone
to call me
when I'm blue.
I feel safer w/o someone
I'm free to linger, to laugh,
To flirt
But self esteem points
have reached down to the
negatives since my last
pathetic boyfriend.
I sit down sometimes and think:
Who the hell am I angry at?
Am I angry at the world?
Am I angry at you?
I'm not sure.
All I know is that the
more someone loves me
the more I hate them.
The more someone rejects me
That's when I want them around.
I guess I was doomed to lead
a dreary spinster life,
Or maybe settle down
with some rich jerk
who doesn't want me.
Either way I won't get very
many kisses or a phone
call when I'm far
away and
lonely.
