I remember when
love was a stranger
in a lonely life I led,
then you came along,
and my world changed
for the better.
You put sunshine into my smile,
air under my shoes,
made me feel ten foot tall,
and filled with love this empty shell.
Now love walks with me,
everywhere that I go.
The lonely life I lead is no more.
You are my soul and inspiration
as into the future we go.
