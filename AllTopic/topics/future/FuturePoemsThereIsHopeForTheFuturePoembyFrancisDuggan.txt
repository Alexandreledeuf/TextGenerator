The bombs have caused death and destruction and the families mourn their dead
But there is hope for the future for better days ahead
When those for peace and World harmony will finally prevail
For those who talk of waging war are surely doomed to fail.
There is hope for the future though I may not live to see my dream
Of a better life for everyone in a World where peace will reign supreme
A World free of borders and camps for refugees
Where the smell of death and destruction is not blowing in the breeze
There is hope for the future around me not all dark
I hear young children playing in the playground in the park
The children are the future and they may well unite
Behind a peaceful leader who won't lead by power of might.
There is hope for the future and all surely not lost
Though there won't be peace tomorrow and 'twill come at a great cost
The Rose of Peace will bloom again though with the dead I lay
And the young and enlightened leaders to peace will lead the way.
