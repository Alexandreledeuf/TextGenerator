Universes collide,
scorched sky-
pastel people, rainbows of the world
So many dreams and nightmares
I would like to leave with you,
if I could bring my pen
to touch the page.
We are time:
wrapped neatly in flesh and bone and thoughts-
We are lost-
we look for castles in the clouds,
cities beneath the earth-
learn of our history to understand our future.
We toil and cry with our Mothers to be born of our Father's flesh.
They tell me: life is a blessing, no matter the circumstance,
no matter that we are born, drunk on our Mother's failures,
made to bear the burdens of our Father.
Mother says: I labored to bring you into this world.
I tell her: and I will labor when you leave it.
we've completed this uneasy circle
of hours rapidly bringing an absolution-
' and how does that make you feel? '
' like everyone else I suppose '
