I know you're not born yet
But one day you will be
This is your father
That one day you'll see
Theres things you should know
Things good and bad about me
I'm nice, caring, and a real friend
This is me until the end
I'm sad, depressed, and rejected
This is the bad in me
I hope you're not affected
Just because my father never would
I'll love you the best that I could
I'll be there for you, bad or good
I'll feel your pain, so you'll feel ok
Promise me, you'll go to school
I can't wait for that day
So I could lay down the father rule
Until you're born and things are such
Know that your father loves you very much.
