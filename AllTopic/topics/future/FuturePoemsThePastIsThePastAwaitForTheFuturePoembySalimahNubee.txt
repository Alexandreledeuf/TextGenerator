Yesterday you ignored me
Today you think of me
Years ago, you cursed me, backbite me
Today I’m called a good person
Months ago, I was rejected for no clear reasons
Today you say if I had known, I would have accepted you
Weeks ago, I cried out my heart longing to befriend you
Today tears are flowing, longing to see me, to feel my presence, to befriend me, to hear at least my breath…
Why when it’s too late you will regret
Why regret when you could think
I was someone alone with myself and in crowd of people
You would raise your eyes when I’m falling into ruins, when I wrongly act
You would ignore me when I do good
Why you have power to hurt when I’m here
And the present would fade such power into tears, into regrets when I’m no more
Why you would call my name when a freezed air separate us now
Please don’t cry now…
Please don’t hurt my memory…
Please don’t long to see me now…
I want to return back and cry with you to pacify you
Today I’m no more in your world; I see how important I am to you
I want to return back now but it’s too late
A last word…..
Keep your feelings till we meet again
Let me go now… Peacefully At Least… To my new abode
Don’t let me miss you now…
My time has come suddenly, but the clock has not yet stopped for you
You could not love me when I was here; All you can do now is to learn how to love others in your world now…
