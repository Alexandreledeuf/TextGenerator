I never really imagined me
The me in the future, who I'd and where
People ask me, but all i do is stop and stare
Staring through them, it's like i cannot see
I never thought of myself in the future
Because all i ever wanted was to die
And then now people ask me, so i start to try
But i still can't see me....why?
I want to be with her
In the times yet to come
But if I'll be there I'm not really sure
It makes me feel so dumb
Maybe i won't be around then
Maybe I'll be long since gone
But when i ask myself, when
When might i leave, and forget all I've ever been
