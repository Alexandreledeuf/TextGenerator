In this world which will someday fall to ruims
Dreams and hopes don't matter at all
Oh, because you're asleep within your heart
You will never awake
But feel with those hands
The future that can't be changed
Runing from your life
Even if I sacrifice this life
That will someday burn out
Drowing in my dream
Even if I drown
A dream is only but a dream
You are my starlight
