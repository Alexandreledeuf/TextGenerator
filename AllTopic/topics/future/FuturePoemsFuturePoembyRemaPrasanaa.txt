Near the shore of that eventful destiny,
hold us no resentments of the past.
From the mistakes of the past, let us
not challenge the present and my friend,
I know I hurt you and even you hurt me.
For the time on which we heal the past
and erase our eroded egos
and I promise I cause you
no further harm, from my anger
on which I reacted but not intentional.
Calm now the seashore and I know
it is not easy to forget the clouds
of shadows covered on one
good friendship and at the end
wisdom is not a flagship label
to  cover the pretences of life
And i feel it is time to forget and forgive
in grace as life is too short to settle
scores on a battlefield to dampen
the creative brightness of  future..
