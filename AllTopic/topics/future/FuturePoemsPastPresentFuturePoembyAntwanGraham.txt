My past is full of trouble
My present is filled with wisdom
My future is very uncertain
Which way do i go
Who should i listen to
My past has answers
My present seek questions
My future uncertain
Who am i
Who are they
What do you want
My past
My Present
My future
My life
Yet i don't know my future
But i hope i thrive on what i have learned
And what i have learned is what will make me surrive
Life
