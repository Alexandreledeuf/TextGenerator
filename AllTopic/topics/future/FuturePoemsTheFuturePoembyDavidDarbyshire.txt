Is it true?
that the future is always bright
in the past
there was not much light
The future is ours to behold
but what I was told
in the future
you get old
The future will come
this is sure
yours and mine
one sec. at a time
Until the final curtain
our lives uncertain
what the future will bring
will be exciting
