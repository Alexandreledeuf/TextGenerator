Before me stands I see,
a faceless form of the future.
I see an engraved darkness of her face,
so that I shall not know,
who this faceless person will be,
or our meeting how.
An before me I see the beauty of all creation,
so that I shall know not to yield to temptation.
For every mortal there is a weakness,
and within this weakness, temptation has its strength.
For me after my future love I’ve seen,
temptation seems heartless and mean.
Even though I guard against,
I am helpless in a sense.
For like a flower straight and tall,
must bend with the wind.
Therefore, I must lean a little when temptation calls.
