We are the future
with our spikes and chains,
our baggy pants,
And unused brains
We are the future
With our belly shirts,
Hooker boots,
In mini skirts
We are the future
with our torn up jeans,
our rude t-shirts,
Wearing diamond rings
We are the future
With our high dollar clothes,
our rap music,
Pink polished toes
We are the future
And our parents hope and pray
That we'll all grow out
Of this someday
