A toy locomotive
fresh red paint
on it’s wooden boiler
waits on time for completion.
Black and white tints
stands ready in jars
for the peeling
of masking tape.
and a grandmother’s
meticulous brushing.
The little train
In brightest color array
will match another
quilted on a toddler’s comforter.
Nathanael, know that you are richly loved
by the tender body and soul
that once enclosed your mother.
