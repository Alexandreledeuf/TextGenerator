We stand together, united as one,
forward on we go, facing friend and foe.
We do not turn back for regret;
we have not time for that.
If we make mistakes
we will repair them at a future time,
we can stop to help an injured soul,
for a brief moment in time as we go.
Our mission lies, somewhere in the future,
so we cannot linger here.
What our mission is, only someone else knows.
We will know what it is
before the final curtains close.
