Cast away living in a bubble,
Ir orbit around an endangered earth.
Lost among the skyhawks of futuristic power..
Iâ€™m sworn to take an oath.
To move unseen through portholes in chase.
Where eyes of an eagle sore  deep dark space.
I live my life far away from home.
Protected, without fear, in a bubble I roam.
Man crushed the evergreens of earth.
Water contamination, no more rebirth.
I, with a chosen few,
see the earth from a different view.
