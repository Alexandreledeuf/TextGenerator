I have climbed the mountains of wonder
I have seen the valleys of death
I have wakened the deaf with silence
I have suffocated immortals with breath
I have run from sure victory
I have stared in the face of defeat
I have bottled the wind from the ocean
I have prevailed when surely beat
All this I have done
All this and more
I know what the past is
But none of what's in store
Will the earth convulse in sadness?
Will dawn break and joy reign again?
Can we venture to the depths of space?
Can we travel to any when?
Confusion and a cacophony
Of breath and stilling air
The future does not matter
Because we are already there
