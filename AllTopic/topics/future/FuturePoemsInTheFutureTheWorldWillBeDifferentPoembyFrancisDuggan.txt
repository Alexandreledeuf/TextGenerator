The World energy resources depleted and the oil wells are running dry
And perhaps in a decade from now the super rich will become poorer when they realize their money cannot buy
Gas to put into their big cars parked in their garages the people with nowhere to go
To yet it is a known fact out of hardship that spirituality can grow.
We are being told that this is to happen by those one might say in the know
The oil reserves won't last forever we heard of that decades ago
Yet what did we do to conserve energy we went out and bought bigger cars
And spent billions in money and wasted huge amounts of energy building rockets for research on Mars
What will happen when the oil wells will run dry when the super rich will realize
That Government Bureaucracies them were deceiving and leading them on with their lies
Will billionaires jump off of big buildings when with financial disaster they come face to face
In a decade from now the World as we know it could be a much different place.
In the future the World will be different and that may not be such a bad thing
For Nature will live on as usual and songbirds in the morning will sing
And we must go back to the pushbikes and with less pollution in the air
We will be far healthier people and more spiritually and environmentally aware.
