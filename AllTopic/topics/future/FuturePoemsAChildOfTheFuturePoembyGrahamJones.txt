In the hustle and bustle of modern day living
A place full of greed and much less forgiving
In back streets and alley's, in dust and decay
A new breed of child reaches out for the day
A child of the future, quick witted and sour
His ambition survival, He lives for the hour
Nobodys child with nowhere to run
Allegiance to no one, and a needle for fun
No one to care if he lives or he die's
No child protection to witness his cries
If this is our future, then there isn't much hope
You know what they say, if you give enough rope
Put a price on the misery, we leave in this world
Small ragged bundles curled up in the cold
Wheres the compassion, Have we no sense of shame!
If we sow fields of sorrow, then expect crops of pain.
