im a little confused right now so in other words im not really sure
if i can slow down or even stop my past becoming my future
i can  see it comin a mile away
what can i do? what can i say?
who even cares seriously cause in all reality im not even sure that i do..
i try and try to do the right thing
but it just feels like stress and more stress is all it brings
now i want you to realize that this is not written and this one is off he top of my head
maybe im havin a bad day and i need to vent
or maybe its somethin someone said...
im good though i feel better already...
and thats the magic of poetry...
