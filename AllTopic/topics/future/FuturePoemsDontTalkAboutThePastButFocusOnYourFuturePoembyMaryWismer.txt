Don’t talk about the past but focus on your future
I would prefer to know about the previous
relationships of the one “my one” and I would
tell him every thing about me.
I think its something that makes
us closer to each other.
Of course I don’t like to know the details
such as how much he loved
her or what he was doing to make
her happy or what ever of these details
because it will not help or do any
good thing to the relationship but
I would ask about how these relationships ended,
why and what he didn’t like about them.....
But after talking about such things
with your partner you shouldn’t be
judgmental and you should never
talk about it again, or listen to any
one else talking to you about it,
or use it against him / her someday
because that would break your partner’s
heart and he/she will never be honest with you again.
Just listen, take what you wanted  to know,
and throw the story behind your back.
Just keep in your mind that it’s the past
and you are your partner’s present and future
and this is the only important thing now and forever.
I personally believe you should give
the second part as much information
as he/she plans to drag out of you.
If one needs to know the name of every
other gender person you talked to,
then squeeze your mind and remember.
If he/she only asks for headlines,
then go ahead and offer them but
spare him/her the details if he/she seems
not wanting to bother him/herself with the
details of a past history.
What I'm trying to say, let the other part decide
how much they want to know, and work accordingly.
