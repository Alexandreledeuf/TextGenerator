I dreamt that she and I had met
when we were young and fancy free.
It is a dream I shan’t forget
but will remember happily.
We fell in love and we were wed
together raised a family.
I see the pictures in my head.
My dream was Oh so right to me.
It was a dream that could not be.
We did not meet we did not wed
but yet I hold the memory.
Perhaps  allowed to look ahead
See what in time would come to be.
She married but she was betrayed
I wed and raised a brood of three.
A sad mistake which fate had made.
When we were old and fancy free.
We met as we were meant to do
The fates had reversed their decree.
Brought us together and we knew.
That you were meant to be with me
and I was meant to be with you.
Too late to have a family
I am content just finding you.
Perhaps it’s possible to see
some things which haven’t happened yet
That in due course will come to be.
A vivid dream you can’t forget.
Some sort of future memory.
I only know my dream came true
when you agreed to marry me
I had to wait so long for you.
