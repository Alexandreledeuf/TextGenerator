I do not change my future on my own;
God has been doing that for me till now;
Amidst my earthly problems, I’m alone;
Nevertheless, I’m safe: I don’t know how?
Some people work all by themselves in life;
Their trust in themselves is more than in God;
They scheme to drive out penury and strife;
Nevertheless, they get their earthly rod.
The one who puts his trust in God is wise;
His peace of mind and heart are excellent;
The one who trusts himself lands up in vice;
He wastes his precious time that God has lent.
Have faith in God and future looks alright;
The atheist does suffer sad a plight.
