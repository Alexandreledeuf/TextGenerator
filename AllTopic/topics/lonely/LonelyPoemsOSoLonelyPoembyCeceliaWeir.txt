O So Lonely
Are the days gone by.
When others enter your life
Then you push them by.
O So Lonely
When you were in control.
To love them or leave them
You were ever so bold.
O So Lonely
While you sit alone.
No one is there
To make your house a home.
O So Lonely
After all the hearts you break.
Did you ever think it was you
Who you'd really forsake?
O So Lonely
When life was just a dare.
You didn't take time to love
You didn't try to care.
O So Lonely
Have you learned the rule?
That its not just about you
But it does take two.
O So Lonely
Why sit and contemplate?
While others enjoy life
Its never too late.
