The lonely soul wanders
Alone in the walks of life
No other soul as his companion
The lonely soul wanders
Alone in the daybreak
He does his duties
In the walks of life
The lonely soul wanders
Alone in the life
He meets many other souls
Who comes to be
Unfit for the lonely soul
The lonely soul wanders
As the days pass by
The lonely soul became
More lonely, with no other
souls as his companion
The lonely soul wanders
Alone in the walks of life
The lonely soul decides
Not to die, but to face
Life in all its hardships
The lonely soul wanders
