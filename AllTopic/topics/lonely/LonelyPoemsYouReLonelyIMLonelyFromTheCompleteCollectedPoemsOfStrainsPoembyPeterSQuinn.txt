We are always coming lonely
And trying to be together
For you and you only
Are flickering like the weather
And dreams are too far away
To be of any reality
Like a morning that meets a day
Only to be in its company
The night is for both of us
Trying to find times thread
And trying to catch up with every loss
That comes to be with us instead
Like love that grows older
And catches us in our while
Time is its many folder
And every its timeless style
We are always coming to change
And letting the weather conclude
Every its beating blanches
That gives every season its mood
We cannot forget the crying
In the hours many singing tone
As this time's season is dying
And we again shall be alone
