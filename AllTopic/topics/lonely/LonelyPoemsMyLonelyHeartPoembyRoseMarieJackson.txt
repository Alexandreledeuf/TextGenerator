My lonely heart
Holds much despair
Emptiness
Emptiness
Is often found there
My pillow is filled
With tears and fears
Though we've been married
For eighteen years
My lonely heart
Cries night and day
My husband's love
Seems miles away
Though we're together
Day by Day
My lonely heart
Cries night and days
Is there any
Consolation
For my lonely heart?
