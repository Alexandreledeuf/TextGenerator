This is to show that despite people may feel lonely, they truly wallow in their own pity.How pathetic.
The lonely soul wanders
Alone in the walks of life
No other soul as his companion
The lonely soul wanders
Alone in the daybreak
He does his duties
In the walks of life
The lonely soul wanders
Alone in the life
He meets many other souls
Who come to be
Unfit for the lonely soul
The lonely soul wanders
