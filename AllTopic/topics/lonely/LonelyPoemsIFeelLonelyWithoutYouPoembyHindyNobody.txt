When i don't get to hear from you
I feel so lonely
When i don't get the chance to see you
I feel so lonely
When i know you're not there
I feel so lonely
When i'm sad, there's no one to lean on to
I feel so lonely
When i'm thinking silently
I fell so lonely
There's no one that i wanna be with apart being with u
I feel so lonely
There's no one better than u
I feel so lonely
God why do i feel so lonely?
When i know i can't come to u
As anytime, whenever as i want to...?
And why do i feel so angry....
God...
I wish i was with u
Each day's been killing me
Looking at ur pics,
it brought back the memories
Shaking my head
How can i go through?
AzZ, there's no one special except u
and i just wish i could show it to u
Missing u loads
