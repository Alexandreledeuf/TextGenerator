My inner sides are twisting,
my heart is losing pace,
my legs are always shaking,
i no longer hold my grace.
My mind is slowly bending,
im crippled in by pain,
my face is red and crumpled,
as my eyes begin to rain.
Im turning from the living,
and im racing to the dead,
im spinning and im falling,
my dyings just ahead.
My heart is burst in agony,
my blood is draining out,
my voice is just a memory,
i no longer scream and shout.
My legs have no more feeling,
i've hit the cold hard ground,
And i'll lie here in a twisted mess,
untill by love im found.............
