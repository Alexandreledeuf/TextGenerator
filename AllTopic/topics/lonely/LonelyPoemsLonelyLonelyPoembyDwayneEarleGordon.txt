Girlfriend, I'm so lonely
I love you and you love me
Girlfriend, I'm so lonely
Please come back, N be my baby
'Repeat Once'
These are the words I cry when my girl left me
I call her, and tell,
Listen, you are my baby
No matter what, you' re # 1 lady
I went to her house, and I tried to see her
Her mom came out, told me I was a dreamer
I didn't take it as a big deal
Because she don't know that my feelings is real
Dear girl, I will love you to the end
No matter what, you will be number one girlfriend.
