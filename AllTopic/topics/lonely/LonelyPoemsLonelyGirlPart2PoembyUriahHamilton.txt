Lonely girl, visit me on housetops
That weep overlooking the flowerless city;
All the roses reside in your vulnerable eyes
Where I fall asleep for fragile centuries.
Thereâ€™s a sunlight glint
On dining-room wine bottles;
Even when my love feels
Exhausted and half-spent,
I have another glass to pour for you.
Always refuse to be carried
By the melancholy breeze that whistles
Through the cemetery trees
Sympathetic symphony of tears
And brings you to eternal homes.
