Fly away oh bird of love
Carry your feathered gift unto another
For my time is short
Gold has more meaning than thou
I have no time for such matters of the heart
Perplexed and not granting the price I need
My call is heard daily
And I heed for its ransom is high
It supplies me with a bed for one
Dinner by candlelight for only one
So what need do I have
For the grave holds only one
