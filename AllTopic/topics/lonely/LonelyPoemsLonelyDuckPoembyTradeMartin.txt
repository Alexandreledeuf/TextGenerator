Lonely Duck…., where’s your home….? ? ?
I see you swimming in the river all alone….,
Are you sad…., just like me….? ? ?
Or do you have a secret family….? ? ?
At low tide…, you search the muck…,
For a morsel you can eat….,
Lonely Duck….,
Day by day…., I wish you luck….,
Cause you’ve really got it tough….,
Lonely Duck.
I’d like to help you…,
Lonely Duck…,
Even try to buy you lunch for a buck…,
Do you laugh…, or do you cry…? ? ?
When your partner leaves you….,
Do they say the word 'goodbye'….? ? ?
Cause as I watch you…., going nowhere…,
I feel as if you’re wandering endlessly…,
Just like me…, Lonely Duck….,
Just like me.
