She curled up on her windowsill,
A lonely girl, crying out her heart,
For the boy that never loved her,
And the friends that just don't care.
She wallows up in her pain,
The girl with the lonely heart,
The girl with no boy to love,
But she didnt see what mattered.
She walked up the hallway, makeup smuged,
Tears running, the people they stared.
Untill now, they never knew,
She was just a lonely girl, with a lonely heart waiting for someone to love.
