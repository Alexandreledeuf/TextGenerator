The lonely Angel cries to herself,
Her head is hung low and her body is still,
She calls out into to darkness and hears her voice echo,
But there is no one else in her empty world,
She locks herself in afraid of what might happen,
Closes the illusive curtains and shuts the door to her feelings,
Her beautiful face has grown old with crying,
The perfect smile painted on her lips has been wiped off,
And her dreams and aspirations have all been erased.
She waits patiently for her walls of solid emotion to tear,
Her cares are not for money, power or enlightenment,
Instead love and care is all that seeks,
Memories whispered gently into her ears is all she has for company,
She lays naked with no clothes to protect her,
Her prayers are always for a light to guide her,
A small crevice created by her hope lets warm air upon her,
She sometimes huddles against this unique warmth,
And she knows that if she lets go of hope she will be cold forever.
