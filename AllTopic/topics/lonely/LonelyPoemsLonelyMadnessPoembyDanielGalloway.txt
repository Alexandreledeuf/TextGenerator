Moments that make up my life
seem to be empty
echoes of my own self loathing
plague me
they say I'm a fool
I feel the black dog barking at my door
persistent pain persistent voices
telling me I'm  all wrong
a perfect isolation that tortures me everyday
the self scars  upon my arm
remenants of pain that feels relieving
I speak to people, I feel detached
'normalcy' seems like bullshit
is it me or am I going mad
is it me or are they just full of it
