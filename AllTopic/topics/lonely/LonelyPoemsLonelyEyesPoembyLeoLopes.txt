It doesn't matter how hard i try
Even though i'll be dyin inside
Look deep within and tell me what you find
I just can't seem to hide
These Lonely Eyes
They say nothing's harder than life
And those who live well are welcome in the sky
There's something wrong and i wanna take flight
I just can't seem to hide
These Lonely Eyes
Now that you're Gone Away i think i wanna die
I know you can see it, I'm surrounded by light
I tried to tell you i'm fine but that's a lie
I just can't seem to hide
These Lonely Eyes
As i see happy people go by
I'm so confused here, sometimes i wanna cry
I'm just a lonely soul lurkin in the lonely night
And i just can't seem to hide
These Lonely Eyes
