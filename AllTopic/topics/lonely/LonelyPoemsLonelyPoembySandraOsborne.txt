Lonely.
How to describe it?
Maybe a leaf on a snow covered field,
Maybe a log in the middle of a lake,
Maybe a snow flake in the middle of June,
Maybe a tree in a crater on the moon,
Maybe a canoe in the middle of a forest,
Maybe a star in the middle of the day,
Or maybe me, in the middle of you.
