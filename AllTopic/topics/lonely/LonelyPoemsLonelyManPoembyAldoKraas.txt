Lonely man you need to
Discover this world which is
Beautiful
Be a part of this world
You are setting your foot on the ground
There are many opportunities out there for you
Do you know what you are looking for?
Lonely man
Grab a tissue paper out of your pocket
And wipe the tears that are falling from your eyes
It must be the cold weather that is doing it to your eyes
You don't know yourself at all
You need to learn to be open to yourself
And to find out who you realy are
This will be a mystery for you to learn about yourself
Lonely man
The night soon begun
And you went to bed right away after I had given you supper
Lonely man
Don't you know it is Christmas?
Lonely man
I don't judge you
Lonely man
I know that you don't judge me
Lonely man
See you tomorrow
Have a good night
Lonely man
Do you believe in God?
Lonely man
Are you a chrisstian?
