There is a word I long to say
To someone who is far away.
That word is- Mother.
There is a hand I long to touch
Of someone whom I love so much
The gentle hand of - Mother
There a two lips I long to kiss
Of someone whom I always miss
The tender lips of - Mother
Oh come to me and ease my pain
Tell me I'm waiting not in vain
Hear my lonely cry - Mother
