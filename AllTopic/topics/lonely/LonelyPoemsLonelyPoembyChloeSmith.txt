I stand alone in darkness,
A rose held in my hand,
The wind rustles in the trees,
As it sweeps across the land.
I wait for your arrival,
I hope it will be soon,
I want to dance with you again,
By the light of the silver moon.
And though you do not miss me,
I hope you won’t forget,
That the little girl you left alone,
Will grow stronger yet.
I hear your footsteps on the ground,
Have you come back for me?
You take the rose from my hands,
And throw it in the sea.
You sneer at me for waiting,
What a pathetic thing to do,
“How could you believe, ” you hiss at me,
“I’d love a thing like you? ”
