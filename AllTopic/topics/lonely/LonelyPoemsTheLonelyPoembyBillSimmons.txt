This thing that they call love
That so many are in search of
What some they may find and some lose in time
Only the lonely dream of
The lonely dream only of it one day in their lives
When that day comes they won't toss it aside
The lonely they know and will cherish so
For only the lonely get it right
Love of so many descriptions
The art every part of the heart
Love when it comes to the lonely of one
They will hold on and believe not let it fall apart
I know that since I have found you
Somehow you reached out and found me
I know cause I know where it is I have been
The lonely has allowed me to believe
This thing that they do call love
This thing that so many are in search of
This thing that only the lonely they dream
I know, I once dreamed of your touch.
