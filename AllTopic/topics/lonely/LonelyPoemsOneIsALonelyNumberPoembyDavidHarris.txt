One is a lonely number
Two is company
One is the last word in alone
That’s what I’ve been since you left me
One is also in lonesome
The last word in it is me
Alone and lonesome
Seems that is all I’ll ever be
We were perfect together
So everyone said
We had everything going
Only good times ahead
Then without warning
or angry words said
You took the first train in the morning
Leaving me with bad times ahead
