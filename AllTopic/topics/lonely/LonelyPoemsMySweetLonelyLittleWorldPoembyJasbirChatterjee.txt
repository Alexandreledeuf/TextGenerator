Come, step
into my sweet, lonely little world!
Hand in hand,
We shall run across the cliffs
against which my emotions crash,
Fly through the capricious clouds
Through which my wild fancies fly,
Swim in the deep waters of the sea
in which lie buried the secrets of my heart,
Sing and dance
to the music of the swaying plants and the whistling winds,
and when weary and hungry,
eat the Forbidden Fruit.........
But perhaps you would wish to run away,
Perhaps you have your own sweet, lonely little world......
But first,
Come, step
into my sweet, lonely little world!
