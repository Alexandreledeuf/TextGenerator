On tears lonely lonely cry
You always shade on my mind
Even you had flied away
Left me alone in the night
On tears lonely lonely cry
No one can take that place
My first love you have to know
You’ve never gone in my heart
Oh why, oh why
I can’t forget your kiss goodbye
I want crying to you
Bring this pain from my life
On tears lonely lonely cry
My first love you have to know
The memory was closed
In my broken lonely heart
