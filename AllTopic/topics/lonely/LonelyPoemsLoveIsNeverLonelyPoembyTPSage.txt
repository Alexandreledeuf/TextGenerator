I want to show you rainbows
and feel your soft touch on my cheek
when they bring tears to my eyes.
I want to whisper my love to you in the morning
when everything and everyone sleeps
for silence will not harbor lies.
I want to hear your voice when I'm not with you
as if it were my own thoughts
and love was never alone.
I want to see in your eyes the truth inside me
so that everyday that I question
I can look at you and know.
I want to take your loneliness
and paint it over with bright memories
till only love is in view.
Should the stars appear for just one night every thousand years
I would wait a lonely eternity
to see them with just you.
