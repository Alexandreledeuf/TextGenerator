After a long season of heartbreak
And months of indecision,
After insufferable nights of tears
Reflecting on kisses once placed
On your gentle moonlight face,
My broken heart receives crystal clear vision:
When love has ended
And friendship wanes,
One must depart the city
Of all his shattered dreams
And find a new place
To begin again,
Unknown paths to tread
Where there is no fear
Of finding a perfumed handkerchief
You once kept
Or of running into a mutual friend
Who saw him weep
The last lonely night
He walked upon your street.
