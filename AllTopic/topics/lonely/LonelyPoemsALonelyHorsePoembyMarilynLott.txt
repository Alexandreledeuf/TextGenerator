I'm out in the field
Roaming the vast prairie
Waiting for somebody
To come and visit me
Occasionally I'll see
A car or truck around
I'm stand here just waiting
In my deserted prairie ground
I'm quite a handsome fellow
Just look here for yourself
Sometimes I feel my owner
Has put me on the shelf
I'm good for many things
I could win as a show horse
If someone only entered me
Into a show of course
But pretty soon I know
The kids will come on by
Visit me and ride me
And on my back they'll fly!
