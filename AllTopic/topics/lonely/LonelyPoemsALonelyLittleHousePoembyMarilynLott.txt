A lonely little house
Built many years ago
Is deteriorating now
I thought you’d like to know
Its boards are warped and falling
One by one onto the ground
But mostly in the stillness
You can’t hear a single sound
Except when the cattle are grazing
Around the house at times
A cowbell occasionally clinks
Like a soft ringing of chimes
Its roof now is sinking
Its windows too are gone
Time and weather are not helping
But it knows where it belongs
For the stories this house could tell
Are so many from its prime
It housed a growing family
Once upon a time
I love the frontier houses
That were built to run a farm
Part of the past we inherited
They will always have such charm!
