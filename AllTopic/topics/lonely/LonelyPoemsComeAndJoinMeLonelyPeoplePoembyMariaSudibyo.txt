come and join me, lonely people
this moon is too cold to be seen alone
in midnight, the wind stops
nobody wake on the street and you there lonesome
mind I sit next to you?
come and join me, lonely people
this world's silent and prepares to sleep
in winter, the star sparks
to bring the new eve of snow
care about me lonely?
