Each day you wake up with a frown
Rumours keep spreading around town
That youâ€™re suffering a mental breakdown
A solitary walk you walk
A lonely talk you talk
As you wander as a lonely
You wander as a lonely at night
You wander as a lonely on sight
You wander as a lonely at day
You wander as a lonely and pray
You wander as a lonely each day
Slow down, slow down
Shut down, shut down
Shutdown the lonely before you drown
Embrace your friends with warmth
They can give you assistance
Deliver you from your lonely existence
You keep fighting love
Bending it around like a curve
With your glowering face
Reserving only a lonely place,
Halting happiness to arrive in your life
Do you ever stop to wonder?
Do you ever stop to ponder?
Are you the reason for the lonely blunders?
Slow down, slow down
Shut down, shut down
Remove from your head that lonely crown
You wander endlessly as a lonely
Searching for a spot called homely
But your face is missing that vital smile called lovely
