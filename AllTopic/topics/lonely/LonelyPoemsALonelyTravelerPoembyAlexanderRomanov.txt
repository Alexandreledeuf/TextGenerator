Who will love a lonely traveler
Who traveled far & seeks some rest
I will, said the old tree
My leaves shall shade you from the sun
So you can sleep
And all your darkest secrets
For you I shall keep
Who will take pity in his heart
And who will feed a starving traveler
I will, said the serene lake
For in my unfathomable waters
I have plenty of fish
So eat & drink my friend
As much as you wish
Who will love a lonely traveler
And who will remember his name
I will, said the earth
For all I created returns on to me
From dust were you made
And dust you shall be
