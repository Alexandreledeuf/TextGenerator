Sit in a chair
alone
People I thought were
friends
sit together but away from me.
Alone
I sit, wishing my
friends
would sit by me.
Alone
I get the urge to cry, for
friends
who donâ€™t speak to strangers.
Alone
I sit, looking at the clock, seeing
friends
consider me as nothing.
Sit in a chair
alone
People I thought were
friends
sit together, but away from me.
