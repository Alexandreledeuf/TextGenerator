A heart breaks easier alone
When no one sees you crying
When no one notices at all
That inside you are dying
A heart breaks easier alone
When they all think you're crazy
That when you crawl back in your bed
The whole world thinks you're lazy
A heart breaks easier alone
And there's no way to mend it
To stop the heart from breaking more
You simply have to end it
A heart breaks easier alone
Without a love to heal it
And finally the breaking's done
When you no longer feel it
