Call me, when you are alone
You know your voice will make my day
You know how much I wait to hear your voice
You know how much I feel for you
You know you can shun my loneliness
You know I listen to you through my tears
You know my tears brings joy to me
You know my heart has grown big
You know your heart is pressed with me
You know I have so many wishes in my heart
You know I am sitting here and thinking how to start
You know I want to send my hugs to you
You know I love you forever in so many ways
call me again and again when you are lone
