loneliness
his childhood
warms him up
loneliness
he warms up to
his childhood
loneliness
childhood
his heaven
loneliness
his childhood
a repository of warmth
meditation
my heart on
a sea of sublimity
so lonely
a poem helps fill out
the emptiness
loneiness
the world
a graveyard
so lonely
i cheer up myself
writing a poem about loneliness
so lonely
i write a poem  to fill out
the emptiness
