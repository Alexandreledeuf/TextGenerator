oh, , sadness...
your circle killing me..
and your memories waves flooded me..
my life is a sky without lights..
where is your yelling o happiness..? ? ?
and in which wilderness, can i found you..? ? ?
i am a star without sense...
i am a candy without taste..
and here alone in that beach....
