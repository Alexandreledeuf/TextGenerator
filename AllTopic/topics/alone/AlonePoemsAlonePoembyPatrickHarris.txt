All alone, no one here
Not even a soul is 5ft near
A 4 player game being played by one
And it is actually kinda fun
'I pick up my life and take it on a one way ticket
Wherever I go it's my path so I'll pick it'
Sitting here alone, by the windowsill
But the air is bored, it must be filled
One comes in, then comes three
They have all come to join me
But I was happy didn't own a bored bone
I was happy when I was alone
