Alone I drift away,
Alone I walk a thousand miles,
Alone I fall asleep,
Alone I stare at the sky,
Alone I sit under a tree,
Alone I cry.
Alone I dream of you,
Alone I hope and pray,
to God who is oh so merciful and powerful
to let me find my way.
Alone I drift away,
Alone I live today,
and alone I'll die someday.
