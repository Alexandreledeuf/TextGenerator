Let us live in peace
Among ourselves
That is our natural instinct
Let us live in peace
Among ourselves
That is our only way forward
Let us live in peace
Among ourselves
That is how we will befriend freedom and justice
Or otherwiseâ€¦
Heaven only knows
What will happen
To our beloved Congo
