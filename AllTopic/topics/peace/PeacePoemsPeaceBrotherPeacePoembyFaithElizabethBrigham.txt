a gentle breeze blows ocean side
the easter lilies usher in the spring
and there you are with your guitar
won*t you play a song for me
cat sang about a peace train and
john imagined the world living
together in harmony but oh how now
world peace seems a far gone thing
there are so many questions
unanswered so it seems to me
while i remember days gone by
when we sang songs of love and peace
