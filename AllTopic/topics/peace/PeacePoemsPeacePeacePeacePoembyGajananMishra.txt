Peace, peace, peace,
World wants peace,
You are right Nandita
I do agree, but
Let me add a few lines
Peace is not in war,
Peace is in our toleration,
Peace is in our living style,
Peace is in our perseverance,
Peace is in our love,
Peace is in the Mantra-
Live and let live.
Let us know who we are
and what should be our role here there.
