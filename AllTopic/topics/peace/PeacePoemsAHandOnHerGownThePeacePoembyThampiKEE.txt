Peace is not a betrayal of this  beloved
Peace is a not a mere  humming song.
Peace is my  lovely girl
She  falling back to me
She is a  star that I can see here
I know you are   there, somewhere here
I’ll not  miss you  this curly hair
I’ll not want to  miss  the smell of  this beloved…..
I know you’ll come back some day
I’m praying that you  are   there, somewhere here
Hope you remember me appaling  again….
I’ll not  miss this purple lintel
I’ ll  not kiss this  lovely lint
Peace is not   really a  gossip
Peace is  not a mere hand on her purple  gown.
Peace is not a gypsy affair.
Peace is not  a gobbling  prayer
You falling  me back  again
The star that I can see in this soaring  altar
This star  I can see in a  dashed  anchor....
Hope you remember me again and again
