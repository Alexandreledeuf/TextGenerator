Alas, I've searched the world to find
That Peace begins within the mind.
It doesnot rest in other men.
Alone, within, will Peace begin.
No movement, plea, or gathered clan
Can force a peaceful state or plan.
It is the individual who
Must make his dreams of peace come true.
You may not find your neighbor kind,
But donot try to change his mind.
Some will not yield to good intentions.
Forget these ones; avoid dissensions.
Meditate your cares away,
And if they fail to leave, then pray.
Then you will know what Peace is of-
Defeat of Hate; the reign of Love.
