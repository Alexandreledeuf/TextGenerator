Peace O peace let it be, let it be,
among Islands near and far,
with colour and creed no bar
by working together in unity.
Peace O peace let it be, let it be,
and to south East Asia show,
how our friendship can grow
by working together in unity.
Peace O peace let it be, let it be,
with people of the Pacific Ocean,
all keeping peace in motion
by working together in unity.
