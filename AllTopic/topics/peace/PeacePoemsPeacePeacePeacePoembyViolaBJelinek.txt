In the Bible-God says, let there
be peace among all nations.
Peace is something to cherish
and behold...whether in heart
or in soul; peace in Spirit, and in
mind...gives us the feelings to be kind
Peace among group's ...minority, black
and white...leads us to do what's right
Peace in our cities, homes, and towns
is what we all need...if it can be found
Peace in the world...among all Nations,
is just what we need for self presentation.
Peace in our lives, with family and friends
Will help make us all ready... when God descends
But there can be no peace, without,
"God's intervention", so let us all
"Accept Him, " and have a world convention.
