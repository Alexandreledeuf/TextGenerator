The church bells are ringing incessantly
Alerting earthlings to join the pilgrimage to pray
Across the sea, mountains and desert wastes,
With peaceful nations and those who went astray.
Oh! glorious church bells throughout the world,
Ring, ring, ring your tidings of everlasting peace,
Proclaim the destiny and imminent end of humankind,
If hatred and hostilities among nations don't cease.
The splendid, angelic chorus in the realm of heaven
Will in unison join the church bells in a peaceful song,
And the Supreme Maker will look down in silent awe,
Upon the massive gathering of a peace seeking throng.
Peace is the objective, as the Supreme Maker smiles,
And the angels prepare graciously to stand aside
To observe all the earthlings worship and pray freely,
Where peace and love should always abide.
