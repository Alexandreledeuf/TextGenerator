Peace is letting life's cares
Roll over your head while
Stamping on them with both feet.
It is daily maintaining control
Of the body, mind and soul.
Peace is steering away from snares
And not taking on life's gloomy cares.
It is being like falling snowflakes
Wonderfully resting serenely as you
Lie on your bed when sick or well.
Peace is letting God have complete control
Of troubles, misery and gloom.
Peace never entertains sorrow
But firmly grips hope for each tomorrow.
Sometimes, peace says speak.
Frequently, peace says be silent.
Peace dwells deep within you and me
Where no mortal being can reach.
Peace cries, "Never let me go
For I am yours to forever keep."
