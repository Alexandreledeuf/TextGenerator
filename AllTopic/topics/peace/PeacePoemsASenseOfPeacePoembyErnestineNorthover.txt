How clear is the air found at a mountain's top,
And breathing this freshness, clarifies all things,
At such high altitude, oxygen can drop,
Then movement slow's, but thoughts fly swift on wings,
Letting the new adventurer explore,
A world that opens wide its magic doors.
Land of peak and valley, sea and shore.
Viewing all this, one's heart pulsates and soars,
Then a sense of peace, envelops the inner soul,
And lightness pervades, where heaviness has been,
Lifting the senses, raising them as a whole,
Introducing pure quietness, making one's life serene.
