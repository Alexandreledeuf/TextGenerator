The meadow nourished in softest
Sedges scattered amid violet milk weeds
Incredible flowered attractions
Hosting dainty butterflies, moths and bees
Each patrol finding warm sunny skie-s
Perfumed bliss softly summoning in
These many tiny witnesses for life
And too, sentinels diligently shield
Safe-guarding a precious new beginning
The fawn a tawny velvet-coated gift
Sheltered by loving aunts, sisters and
Mum over near the cedars, sedge and sun
She  watches me in curiosity
Now a gawky yet cute adolescent
Quietly nibbling crabapples not far from
My sacred space on this prayer-filled morn
