Folks greeting those they meet.
Children playing in the street.
People working hand in hand
For the better of the land.
Atonement with the great I Am.
Lion resting with a lamb.
World leaders shaking hands—
In truth—not because they can.
Sacrificing at all cost
To minimize potential lost.
Such, the face of true peace,
Would bring the world much relief.
May strife and fighting ever cease
And “true” peace be increased.
