Who are they?
The terrorist
They spared none,
Mosque,
Church,
Temple, ……
They made fun,
Of innocent,
Old, kids, sick…
While praying,
While playing,
The evil wind,
A gust,
Full of lust,
Resembles human kind,
Beastly mad mind
They laugh seeing blood,
They extinguish
The lamp of happiness,
The persons of dark age,
Full of hellish rage,
The gods of fear,
With no religion,
Bounded with no region,
Killing without reason,
What's their name?
Who is the master of heinous game?
Now whole world wants to know?
When black is going to be white?
When they are going to remove their fleece?
Waiting for PEACE, PEACE  AND PEACE...
