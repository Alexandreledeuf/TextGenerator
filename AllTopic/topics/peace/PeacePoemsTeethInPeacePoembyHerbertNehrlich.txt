'What happened to your teeth',
she said with eyes that were alert.
'One thousand love bites really,
did what love bites can inflict.'
And when they kissed the glue
that held the dentures
revived itself and stuck
the lovers fast together.
He was no dentist and she
no Spring Chicken.
The missing links had left
with all the teeth.
And that wild night
they slept in bed
and loved each other.
Out in the bathroom,
on the sink were sitting still,
in a tall glass two dentures
fresh and rosy
and they could kiss all night
in total privacy.
