So much has been written
About peace in the world,
Peace on earth, peace be with you,
Shalom.
Peace is more
Than the absence of war,
More than tolerance
More than acceptance.
There can never be peace
Between individuals or nations,
Until we are at peace with ourselves
That inner peace that passes understanding.
