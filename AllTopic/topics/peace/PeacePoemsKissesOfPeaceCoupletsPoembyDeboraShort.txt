Rising pasture as if viewed from angel flight
A mind-blowing beautiful East West imagery
The central topography high up on the hill
To left and east amazing views, hard wood forests
Mature soaring and stately red maples, buckeyes
Black cherries, silver-bells, pignuts, red oaks, hemlocks
Several hundred feet below a snaking Powell
River gurgles pristine over to Norris Lake
Monumental Cumberland Mountain Chains in full
View, just over those peaks views of old Kentucky
The peninsular surrounded in Tennessee
Valley Authority’s glistening assignment
Remote, isolated, secluded and gorgeous
Multicolored green quilts lay far out beyond
Revealing one gray and weathered century old barn
A distant farmhouse’s chimney sends out kisses of peace
Amazing graces to our country’s history, Indians
Of past hunted noble buffalo and became
Cast away savages sent away from sacred lands
Fortune seeking immigrants slowly worked bands
Of great covered wagon teams in Westward dreams
An animation filled in spirit and courage
Sometimes catalogued property of Kentucky
Both Grant and Lee captured the Cumberland Gap
Prized the ability to see great distances
Into wilderness, both raw pain and grand beauty
Intermingle in ancient earth, a warriors’ path,
A settler’s hopeful promise, a rich hunting ground,
A perilous place of adventure, a Union’s grace
All steeped in an awe inspiring beauty
