The man was seated in a pew,
sandwiched between
his wife and children,
head bowed,
all piety and innocence
on his face
mouthing the words
to the preacher's prayer.
Were his thoughts with God
I wondered, or the woman
I saw leaving his car
following a passionate kiss
the day before.
(I was again reminded
not to judge, lest I be judged)
and I'm sure not perfect.
It's said that heaven
has many rooms
- maybe even one for him.
As for me, when the time comes,
I believe I'll request another floor.
Peace be with you.
