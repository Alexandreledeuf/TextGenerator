Within the boundaries of hope,
There are no walls,
Nor is there barrier,
Only hope...
Within the halls of faith,
There is nothing to stop,
Nor cage to capture,
Only hope...
Within the vastness of Love,
there is no one right,
Nor attachment adorn,
Only Love...
Within the soul of self,
There is no condition,
Nor is there containment,
Only self.......
Be Aware....
Be True.......
