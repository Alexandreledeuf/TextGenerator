When the time is right and everyone’s the same
Our world will be perfect with no one left to blame
Rage and hate will be a torn up page
Love and peace will rise above
Death will be for the old who lived to love and be sent above
People will be united all across the globe
Everyone will as one loving, sharing, and peacefully caring
And when no bombs fly through the sky and other work is done
Come and see the peace but don’t ask why
Each and every one of us together forever as one
