WORLD PEACE, is what we now NEED.
Forget the STRIFE! Let go of GREED.
Give up your ANGER, and abandon HATE!
REPLACE that PAIN, with LOVE and FAITH.
To have WORLD PEACE, we must take a STAND.
God placed the POWER in "ALL" of our HANDS.
We can't just HOPE world peace will COME.
We need to ACT, for the TIME has COME.
It's up to "ME" and it's up to "YOU!"
Let us WITNESS, what the POWER of LOVE, CAN DO!
