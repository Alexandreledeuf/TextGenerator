Oh dear peace, you peace us,
Whole day and night we search,
No war we need, we need you,
Crossing far galaxy you come,
You adore and you sing for all,
Like this dusk in Western Sky,
Like the dawn that will come,
Tomorrow will shine with joy.
Peace, unveiling clouds you come,
Like the smile of edentulous sun,
Let sun sleep to wake up tomorrow,
Let sun reborn as child once more,
Let sky crawl in middle of galaxy,
But you swim and run and come soon.
To welcome you, we are waiting here,
We are dreaming whole day and night,
Covering the veil of love you smile,
Peace you peace us by your power.
