A family gives you unconditional love,
Strength and guidance they got form above
They listen when you need and ear
And one thing is they always care
When you need a hand
They’ll lend you theirs
If you’re crying they’ll wipe you tears
If you need comfort, you know where to go
Their love is never hidden it is always shown
They always boast about you to anyone they meet
Family, friends and even strangers on the street
A family is a precious and kind
A family is truly divine
A family is God’s gift to everyone
They are what make your house your home
To be appreciated you don’t have to go far
Because your family loves you for who you are
