It is not the colour of our skin
that makes the person,
but what lies deep within.
We all bleed red blood
no matter what colour we are,
our tears are always salty
whenever they stain our sorrowed brow.
We all breathe the same air,
so why do we discriminate
and caste aside one person from another.
No matter who we are
when we die and go to heaven.
God does not discriminate
from one person to another.
As far as he is concerned,
we are to him just one big family,
no one is different from the other.
Therefore, as we walk forward today
lets link hands and say,
come and join us as we are family.
