We've got a family album
Like a family tree
A thrill to turn the pages
The pictures we can see
Starting off with grands and greats
Then slowly down the line
Like a book of history
A journey through the time
Fashions start to alter
Mustaches come and go
Ladies skirts skip up and down
A proper fashion show
Top hats change to boaters
To caps then none at all
Ladies bonnets disappear
And so does grannies shawl
Picture's change to colour
Black and white has gone
A different place, a different time
So much to look upon
But what is so amazing
Is the likeness we can see
Showing up the genes
Right through our family tree
