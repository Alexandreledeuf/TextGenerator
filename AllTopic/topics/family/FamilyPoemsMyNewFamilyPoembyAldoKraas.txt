My new family I am starting to build
This is the biggest opportunity  for me
I don’t want to die alone
I have seem too much loneliness
And too much sadness in my life
I had gone through it all alone
Not even the evil force can destroy me anymore
My new family soon I will have
I can say that now I am the luckiest woman in the world
Happiness found my way
And it is here to stay
I can’t wait for this moment to arrive that I will have my new family
That I can call my own
I hope my new family will be united
And that I can really love than more
I hope I can be closer and united with my new family
I won’t be lonely anymore
Because my new family will be here soon
And life without a new family is devastating to me
So when this happen I will put together a photo album of my new family
For every one to share
