Tell me what does family mean to you
Is it all the little special things one another do
Or is it the bond that one another has
Maybe its the love from one generation to another one it pass
Family is more than a six letter word
It is a word that often need to be heard
Family is more than realitives they are friends
Friend that will stick with you to the very very end
A family bond is stronger than ever
Because it can overcome any stormy weather
A family stand tall no matter how hard they fall
Uniting as one when their backs against the wall
That is simply what a family do
Helping you become a better you
So when you think about the word family
Think beyound just the background history
Like they say a empty house is not a home
And a true faithful family never stands alone
