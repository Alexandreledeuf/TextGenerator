Of all the silver and the gold,
of all the gems our eyes behold,
we look around and see the sky
and all the clouds go rolling by.
We hear the noise of aer-o-planes,
and listen to the birds that sing.
And then O’ God inside of me a voice
speaks so soft and sweet! And then I
raise my hands to Thee and Thank You
for my family.  The trees in all their beauty be....
In God's creation speaks to me. The
grass, the flowers and all the shrubs
and indications of God's love. The
mountains, valleys, hills, and vales
and even along some lonesome trail
and then O’ God inside of me a voice speaks so soft
and sweet, and then I raise my hands to Thee
and Thank You for my family.  We are all created by God above, and
brought together by His love. We are one
blood, we are all kin, and we are also
each others friend. Wherever we travel across this land, we pray that God will
hold our hands. From every sea to shining sea,
where ever I go, wherever I be the soft sweet
voice speaks inside of me, and then I raise
my hands to Thee, O’ God, Thank You for my
family.
