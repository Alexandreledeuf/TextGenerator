A family that doesn’t belong,
But always knowing we didn’t do a thing wrong!
Your in our family so strong and caring,
Each and every problem is worth you sharing!
I know I have you,
but know that you have us too!
We wont leave your side through our life travels,
Even when our life feels as if it unravels!
No one can get through this thing with out,
We wont leave you in this world to just sit and pout!
This world gets tough and this we all know,
But our family that doesn’t belong will help you make it go!
No secrets will be hidden and for this I know,
We will help you up when you get to your all-time low!
All our little family is a wondrous gift,
Something that only we can uplift!
This is something not even the preps can’t measure,
But the rumors is just their little pleasure!
I know it will hurt and cut you inside,
But your lost family is here for you to confide!
This is our family that doesn’t belong,
But we can get through singing a inspirational song!
This family that doesn’t belong finally has been found,
And no one in this family will let you hit the ground! ! !
