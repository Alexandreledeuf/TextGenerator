One of the most heart felt feelings is
Putting your family first
It doesn't require a scholar or math whiz
To recognize one suffering from thirst
Whether it be for liquid or love
My parents put family first with education
Taught about respect and God above
About land and its preservation
And about family and friends
Sharing the present and the past
Making family number one with love that never ends
And memories that last and last!
