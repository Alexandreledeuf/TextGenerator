We are a family created by God’s design
Rejoice, love each other, and cherish this precious time
Honor your mother and father they are truly gifts from our father above
Don’t wait for tragedy in your life, to show your love
I remember years ago lying in what thought to be my dying bed,
All hope lost and tears being shed.
I reminisced about all our family times and things I wanted to say
I felt time had run out and all I could do was prey
Don’t take for granted the family times we share
The reality fact they won’t always be there
As a family we have been blessed in so many ways
I hope that we take time out to give God, his due praise
Family love is love from the heart
We should never let the evils of the world, break us apart
So as you go through life sometimes feeling all alone
Remember you have family, and you can always come home
