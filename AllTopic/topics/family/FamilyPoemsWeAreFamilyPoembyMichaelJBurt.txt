we are family,
although we do not resemble
although i am black and you are white
although you are rich and i am poor
we are family,
even though i am democrat, and you are republican
even though your ancestors are from Iraq, and mine are from Africa
even though you teach the class i'm enrolled in
we are family,
although i'm a poet and you are a singer
although you are old and i am young
although i'm a gentleman and you a lady
we are family,
even though you praise Allah and I praise Jesus Christ
even though i love football and you play soccer
even though you are a Sagittarius and i'm a Cancer
we are family,
although i prefer rhythm and blues and you love blue grass
even though you have a car and i have a busâ€¦to ride
although i have love and you are alone
even though you dress one way, and i dress the other
although my family loves me and yours does not know of you
we are family,
you and i are family,
me and you are family,
no matter what the difference is
family we are, forever
because we are here, and here is earth
and earth is our home
so here, we will live,
we are family.
