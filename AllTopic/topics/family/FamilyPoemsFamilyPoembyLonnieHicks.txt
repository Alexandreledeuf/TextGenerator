She came to me so sweetly,
life bubbling from within her
strong as an angel's beating wings;
more spirit than child
yet emerging as a person
into this life full blown
brimming with that
unconscious happiness
youth brings.
Understand:
every parent feels this way
about every child,
no matter what happens
in the in-between;
no matter the heart-ache
the Bond remains;
no matter how battered
the relationship,
trust the love
is there beneath
the frown;
no matter the arguments,
the confusion;
the mayhem;
that love is there for you.
It came with your birth
and never dies.
Even love badly expressed
feint and halting
and not enough-
even never expressed;
it is still love.
Disappointments come
from love not hate
only indifference is fatal;
And, you love them too.
Yes, you do.
They are planted in your soul's soil
forever;
indelibly.
They brought  life to you.
Yours is the sacred Bond
Mother and Child
Father and Child
Family
alway present
in mind and heart
never gone.
