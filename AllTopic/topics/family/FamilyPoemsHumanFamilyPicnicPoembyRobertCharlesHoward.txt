Imagine a Human Family picnic
where everyone shows:
from every sect and hue and nation
gathered at a common table.
The Almighty swoops down to bless us:
known to all from Torah, Q'uran and Gospels
and countless other books of wisdom -
known to our souls' aspirations.
After dessert, the Holy One
quakes the earth with his scepter
beside the sacrificial pyre,
“Brothers, sisters and cousins,
images of your creator,
every unholy war
desecrates the face of God
and there is no other kind.
Cast your savage pride to the flames
and live together in peace! ”
Obediently, we toss our
pride onto the pyre
recoiling from its smoldering stench.
The Lion lies down to preen the Lamb's fleece
and Universal Love, released from her chains,
Walks free in every land.
