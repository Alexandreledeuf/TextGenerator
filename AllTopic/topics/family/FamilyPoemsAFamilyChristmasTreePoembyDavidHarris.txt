At Christmas families,
gather around a family Christmas tree
to open gifts of love
each has left there for one another.
The tree sparkles
with lights and coloured tinsel,
while on top there sits an angel
to watch over everyone.
Carefully wrapped presents adorn the floor
around the bottom of the tree.
Each has been wrapped
and sealed with a loving kiss,
one for you and one for me.
Then on Christmas morn
as the dawn breaks the sky
the children climb out of their bed
and tiptoe downstairs to the presents,
getting ready to explore.
Before the day is over
there will be shrills of laughter
and joy ringing out
at all they have received
from beneath a family Christmas tree.
