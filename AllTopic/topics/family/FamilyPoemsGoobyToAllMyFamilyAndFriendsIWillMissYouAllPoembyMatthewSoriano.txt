! ! GOOBY TO ALL MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS….I WILL MISS YOU ALL! !
Tonight I am going end my pain once and for all this is the only way I know that would stop the stabbing pain in my heart I know I only have 14 more days left but that’s too long this pain must
Stop tonight…My friend killed himself over a argument he had with his dad He said 'I WISH I COULD END MY LIFE TO STOP THE PAIN' The next morning he shot himself in the head the next morning
Well tonight I'm go to join you Cries
Tonight I will see you
Tonight will by my happiest night of my life
Tonight I'm going to…well
Let me just say that I'm going to a happier place
I will be
Listening to 'Ave Maria'
I told myself if I was going to kill myself
I would kill myself to the sound of this song
You all did what you could to save and repair my light of hope
And I thank you for this
By the time you knock on my door I will already be in my
Special place
I love you all
'Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already Mastered, you will Never Grow'
