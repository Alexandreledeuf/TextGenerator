Your mouth is biger then
the world is round
someone tells you something
and you run home and tell
my dad
he and you both make me feel
like i dont belong
in this world
you tell him things
that i never said or did
you say things to me
and when i tell him
you deny everything
you are family so i
have to love you
RIGHT?
well i do just
most of the time
i dont feel i have
A reason to love you
