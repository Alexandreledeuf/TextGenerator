uncle dear uncle
what have you done?
of your sister's many children
all are now dead but one....
from a crooked tree's dead reach
your family was hung
dried and mummified by the winds
their souls to ever wander
while your evil roots grow deep
into once hallowed ground
uncle dear uncle
where have you gone?
of your sister's many children
all are dead but one....
And I am coming for you....
