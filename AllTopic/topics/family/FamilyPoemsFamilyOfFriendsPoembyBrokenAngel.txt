How do you live,
in a family,
that never shows love,
that only brings drama and chao,
upon the table of life.
...
How?
because you surround yourself,
with another kind of family.
...
A family,
that never judges you,
won't pull you to the ground,
but pick you up when your down in the dirt.
...
People who,
you can tell anything too,
and won't think differently of you,
after they know,
your deepest,
and darkest most kept secrets.
...
This family,
isn't blood related,
but so much more,
their a family of my friends.
