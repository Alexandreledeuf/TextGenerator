Have u ever thought actually
What it would be like, without a family.
Family is the only one,
Where one experiences best of fun.
Family is an elegant necklace,
Whose bond may appear broken
But deep inside, their hearts are still one.
When the unwanted sorrows seem longer than a mile,
Your dear old family makes you smile.
When because of a mistake no event
Works out for your sake.
When life refuses to mend
There comes a sharp bend,
Family gives necessary amends,
To the family all worries can be sent.
In a fraction of time,
Your sorrows will leave
It may sound absurd
But youâ€™ve got to believe.
Wherever you may be,
You belong to the pack.
And to them you can always go back.
