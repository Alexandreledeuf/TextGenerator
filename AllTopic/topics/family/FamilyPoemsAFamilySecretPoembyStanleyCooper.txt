They keep it so well hidden
This trait they won’t admit
In this family it’s forbidden
To ever mention it
Are they fearful of the flow
This trait of theirs brings on?
Afraid if people know
They’d be oh so woebegone?
Their secret hides a social ill
It’s an unacceptable addiction
This trait results in over-kill
It’s an anti-social affliction
Convinced they’ve gone astray
They crawl into cocoons
It appears it’s not okay
Their feasting on dried prunes
To hell with high society
This family won’t succumb
To hell with snob propriety
They won’t switch from prunes to plums
There  must be things much worse
Though they can’t imagine what
Is it really such a curse
This secret that they’ve got?
