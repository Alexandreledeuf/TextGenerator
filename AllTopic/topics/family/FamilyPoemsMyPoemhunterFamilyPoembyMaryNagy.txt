I've  never felt so ''welcomed''
or just so ''right at home''
It's funny how much we can read
into another's poem.
I've been given such nice offers
of family and of friends.
I hope to keep in touch with them
even if this website ends.
I've gotten an ''adopted mum''!
How sweet this is to me!
It's more than I had hoped for
when I googled ''poetry''.
Now I have been offered
''adopted'' siblings too!
How did I get so lucky
to have just bumped into you!
This site is such a pleasure
where the lost souls can be found.
I love you all and thank you
for letting me hang around!
There are so many others that have made me feel at ease.
I couldn't mention each of you so forgive me if you please!
