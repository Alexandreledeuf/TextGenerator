Don't you just love old family pictures?
Dug out from dusty box or chest
I don't think there is anything else
That can compare - they're the absolute best
There is nothing like those black and whites
The photos from the past
Of course we know from history
That nothing ever lasts
Time moves on, of course it does
But pictures can live without end
They keep our families together
They are one thing that we can depend
Family pictures are such treasures
They take us back in time
They put us in the moment
And let the past unwind
As I go through several lifetimes
And look at my family's history
I'm so thankful I have these photos
They help unravel many family mysteries!
