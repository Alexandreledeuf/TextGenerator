not one less
of this family that must stick together and always save
one another, be it
whatever, a financial distress
emotional stress, societal imbalance,
technological displacements
the family shall be first
even in crime
passion, the family is one
in all conspiracies
not one less, each must be saved from shame
from destruction
i am tired of this,
i am getting out, i am  now a stranger, alone
against this family, i speak my mind, i blow the whistle
now, kill me
i am a corpse, i have long been dead in the dark chambers
of this family
the secrets too deadly,
kill me now, i dare, only if you can....
