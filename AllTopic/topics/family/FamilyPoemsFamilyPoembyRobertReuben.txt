A family is a tree
with its branches and leaves.
Come rain, come shine,
it staggers yet lives.
A family is a body
with its head, hands and fingers.
In sickness or in health,
it shivers and lingers.
A family is a world
with its inhabitants, lands and tides.
In pressure and turmoils,
it quakes but abides.
A family is you and I
engulfed in love.
Come what may,
we soar like a dove!
