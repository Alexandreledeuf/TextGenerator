Your family loves you
Whatever you do,
They love you when
You’re sad and they
Also love you when
You hate them.
Your family is gold;
Nothing can buy them
And nothing can buy
You away from your
Love with your family.
Your family will love
You even when you
Do stupid things
Such as, breaking your
Bones, doing drugs, or
Nearly killing yourself.
Your family won’t care
They will let it
Go and love you
More and more
