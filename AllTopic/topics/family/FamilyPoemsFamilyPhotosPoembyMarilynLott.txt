I love my family photos
Such a simple treasure to me
So many wonderful people
That are part of my history
I look upon their faces
My uncles, cousins and aunts
I see myself in some of them
The eyes... the smile... the stance
Decked out in Sunday fashion
They gathered for a quick snapshot
Some clothes were made at home
And some of them they bought
And look at how far back they go
To the horse and buggy days
Perhaps we were not born yet
Or were small with the past a haze
Oh, look at Grandpa’s trophies
He looks so very proud
He knew he was quite a hunter
Though he wouldn’t say out loud
Let's not forget the animals
That helped to work the farm
They too were part of our family
And had their special charm
Just look at the family autos
They had such class and style
Yes, I love my family photos
Come and look at them awhile!
