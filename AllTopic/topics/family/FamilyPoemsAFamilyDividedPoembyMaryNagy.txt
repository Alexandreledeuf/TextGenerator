Once more we talk about it.
How sad it's all become.
No matter how we look at it
this family is not one.
They say it shouldn't matter.
Who needs them after all?
But, please explain the pain I feel
even though I've got it all.
I see my pain and emptiness
like a hollowed out old tree...
It may seem to be standing tall
but, it's empty just like me.
There's such a contradiction
to my entire life.
I'm happy and fulfilled
being a mother and a wife.
What about 'a sister'
and 'a daughter'...how about that?
These are roles I was born to play.
Why can't I? Tell me that.
A family divided
that's what we've grown to be.
I've got mine and you've got yours
but we have no family tree.
