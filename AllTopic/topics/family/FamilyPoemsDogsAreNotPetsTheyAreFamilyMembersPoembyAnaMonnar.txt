Four Yorkshire Terriers
Tiny, Holly, Charlie, Joy
You gave us many years of happiness
Filled with love, affection and unconditional love
How we took care of you
At night the bed was never crowded
With the four bundles of joy
Snuggling close to their masters
Many years of togetherness
Until each one of you grew quite old
At the end, each one of you crossed the rainbow bridge
Straight to paradise where you saw the white dove
Someday when the time is right
We shall meet again
What joy, peace and tranquility
Never again any disasters
From then on just peace and blessings
Just enjoying the calm
Godâ€™s good will shall give us wings
To protect the ones we love.
