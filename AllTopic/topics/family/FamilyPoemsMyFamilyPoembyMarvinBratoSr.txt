Being born into a big family
in the midst of uncertainties,
Real understanding
and perseverance it carries.
All sorts of human thoughts
and emotions set into focus,
Towards realigning own family solidarity
despite wide disparity
On the basis of practicality
loyalty and sincerity.
Families produced though varied in sizes
and unevenly shared  rapport,
Act on the instinct of love
respect and moral support.
Men and women alike are one
in times of a true call,
Inspiring each member to be strong
and to stand tall.
Life could be rough and tough
yet not one must quit,
Yield only to the family
and never to others outside it.
