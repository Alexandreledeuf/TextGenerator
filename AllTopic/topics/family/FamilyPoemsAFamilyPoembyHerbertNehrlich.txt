Her father was a smart dyslexic
but she was thin and anorexic.
The mother had a bad addiction
to gambling in her jurisdiction.
One brother used amphetamines
the other started in his teens
to rob and steal and even kill
it made the family quite ill.
One day the father, chaired a meeting
next day his daughter started eating.
The mother won a million bucks
one brother said this life, it sucks
the other changed identity
and ended thus his misery.
All five were favoured by the gods,
and, what the heck, they liked the odds.
