To all my family and friends,
I'm happy to say, this is the end.
I've been contemplating death for a while.
Stressed out, as all these problems pile.
I need more help than I can get.
A year in therapy, no improvement yet.
Scarred for life and full of pain.
Unable to clean this everlasting stain.
No one but me knows the whole truth.
Of all the awful things of my youth.
I lie to myself all the time.
Pretending I'm happy and my life is sublime.
Everything is out of control.
I'm tired and worn, my body has taken its toll.
My conscience and morals seem to fade,
As I did the bad things my parents forbade.
I'm tired of making the same mistakes.
I'm tired of all the liars and fakes.
I just want to be gone and disapear.
Living another day is my only fear.
So with this in thought I will take the knife.
Find a vein and end my life.
