My brother Lee Wagner and wife
My sister Billies Rose and husband George Tmeple
Me and my Husband Walter Hoffpavir
My sister Jewel Dyan and husband Curtis Diyon
My sister Ruby Lee and husband Walter Wright
My baby sister Joyce and husband Charles Staples
My brother Walter Toler and wife
I have two boys Rex and Ralph
Living nearby with children of their own
Grandchildren on the way
But where the tall grass grows
Birds nest in the trees
The wind blows free
