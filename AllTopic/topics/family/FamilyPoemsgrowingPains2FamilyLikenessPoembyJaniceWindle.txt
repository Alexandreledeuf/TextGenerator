New born
and strawberry blond!
Your tiny head
thatched like your father's
(used to be, before the grey)
and I said,
'She takes after her father'
(proudly)
But  later,
your hair hidden in a hat,
you gaze calmly at me
with my own ironic expression
and I can see
my mother
and her mother
looking back at me
and I'm proud
and glad
of that.
