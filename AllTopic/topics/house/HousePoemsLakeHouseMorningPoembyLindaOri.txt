Waking to the early morning sound
Of a single trolling motor
Off in the misty distance
With the scent of pristine pine
Breezing gently through the open window;
Sunlight peeking through the rising mist
Slanting onto sand scuffed floors,
A damp bathing suit lies crumpled
In the corner
Waiting for another early morning dip;
Scent of good strong coffee drifting
Through the open doorway
Mixed with subtle lakey  smell
Stirring senses to awaken
And greet this lovely summer morning;
Soon  barking dogs and laughing children
Will mingle with the incessant honking
Of Canadian geese
Wandering aimlessly along the lakefront
In search of tasty morsels washed ashore;
I must go find my special mug....
Feet propped on the railing
Of the deck with chairback tilted
Against the sunsplashed shingles
Gazing out across the sparkling ripples;
A sailboat in the distance dips
Dangerously toward the surface
As the sail scoops water
And the occupant dumps
Into the chilly wake up wetness;
A yell from the startled sailor
Breaks the hazy coffee daydream
It's time to snap out of memories
And take up the tasks at hand.....
Just another lake house morning.
