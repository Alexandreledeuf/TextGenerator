My house is always upside down
It is the funniest house in town
If you throw waste in a dustbin
Or any different type of tin
It will kick the waste back on your face
And push you at their fastest pace
If you don’t wake up from the bed
It will throw out cockroaches fat and red
The tooth brush will brush inside your nose
The tooth paste will lie beneath your toes
The comb will brush the hair on your eyes
The oven will burn all your pies
All the juice will splash on your face
It will also splash inside your nose, what a place.
That’s what will happen if you live in my house
With a mouse that wouldn’t let you drowse.
