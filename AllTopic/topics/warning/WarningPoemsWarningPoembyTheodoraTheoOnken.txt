Within the circumference of circumstance
We conjure up thoughts-once and again
In muted tones of caution
Of less IS more;
Wafting through this moment
Are jagged impressions left
Of a once pristine pure second
Where hand in hand we walked
A ribbon of a highway
Together-totally immersed
In effluent passion-simply oozing;
Upon a journey, so sure Golden;
Off our guard-ambushed
By the copper tendrils, laying in wait
Portents of a Paisley Sky
And a victim filled fate;
