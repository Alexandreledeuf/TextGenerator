Warning: A mass migration of flocks
of the common Trashbird and Junkbird variety
has commenced and is now underway.
We recommend extreme caution if you are traveling
Route D2LR
The migration route extends
only from the den to the living room
so travelers should expect to be suffering mightily from
all the Stuffitis and WhateverwasIkeepingthatforitis and Noroomtositdownitis
maladies normal to the mass migration of these birds...
