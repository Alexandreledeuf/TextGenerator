Can we deselect stupidity?
Coral blanches in the warming seas,
The Arctic cap recedes,
And indifference breeds
An expanding waist of greed.
This is no Greek tragedy.
This is not great Sophocles,
Not Oedipus destroying Mother Earth.
That was accidental. This far worse
As the white faced clown
Is chosen from the chorus,
Merely an Apprentice,
Plucked for the task,
By the call of avarice.
