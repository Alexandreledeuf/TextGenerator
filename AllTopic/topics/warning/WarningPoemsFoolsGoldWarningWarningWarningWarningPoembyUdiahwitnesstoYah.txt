They mold a fake silver coin
From toxins they're forced to join
It takes its toll on the skin
And tricks the blind mind to win
Refrain:
Nickel Cobalt and Chrome
That's where the alchemists roam
To forge gold out of lead
A fool must smelt with your head
The metallic sheen that's aglow
Bares a false toxic light bow
If an arc weld catches your gaze
Its brilliance leaves you in a daze
Scripture foretold long ago
Of the metal mind melding show
Behold mine eyes now know
Minds galvanized, synthesized,
Hypnotized and synchronized.
