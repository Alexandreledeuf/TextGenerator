Lithium tanks are bad
Just like the last one I had
There may be just one clue
It's the spirits in the flue
For in heaven they make so few
You know how they make them too
For they are gun powder you know
They help the spirits grow
The stick em' up is when
You do blow up in end
They finally get to you
Just like I didn't do
For if you think Lithium is great
Go ahead and test your fate
You will hallucinate
When it's the fiery furnace you hate
When around magnetic fields
A strong headache it yields
It swells the users brain
During the memory drain
