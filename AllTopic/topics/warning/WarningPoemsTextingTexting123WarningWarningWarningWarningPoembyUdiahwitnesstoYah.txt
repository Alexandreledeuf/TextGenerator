Texting texting 1,2,3....
Broadcasting live to the next community
Everything said by you and me
Both the secret and public things we say
Violations of all secrecy
Our Constitution is in jeopardy
'All cell phones turned off' you see
Within the circles that use them that way
Maybe a permit be required
Or a court warrant be acquired
For cell phone use even if admired
To prevent the magnetic field decay
Should the cells which use them as security cameras be fired?
Or those who bug you on purpose be hired?
Maybe all should carry a warning sign â€˜this guy is wired'
For the good is far offset by the dismay
