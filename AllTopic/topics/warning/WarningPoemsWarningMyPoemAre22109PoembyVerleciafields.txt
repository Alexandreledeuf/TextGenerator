So real, so very real
and did i say, real
every poem, well just about every poem is real...
one or two lines, maybe made-up to fit my mind set
it doesn't make the CRIMES I write about so untrue
or the loves lost even less painful
and I may never save one persons life or my own
but my poems are very, so very real
and let other stand-up and write
so other will not disregarded there own eyes...
