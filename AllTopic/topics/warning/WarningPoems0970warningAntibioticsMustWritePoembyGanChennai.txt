Reckless Doctors Prescribe Antibiotics Indiscriminately
Without even having a Blood Test, just on the Go
Do You know, Viral Infections have very less Medicines
Will subside in due course on its own automatically?
Antibiotics work only for Bacterial Infections
Not for Viral Infections, Virus escape Antibiotics easily
Many had bitter experience with Qualified Doctors
Prescribing Antibiotics indiscriminately
Antibiotics kill good Bacterias in Stomach
Results, GI upset, Diarrhea, Nausea,
Antibiotics have disastrous side effects
Impaired Liver, Damaged Kidneys are most important
Oflaxacin, Cifexime, Ampicillin, Penicillin are just a few
No accountability for Doctors, Indian Doctors specifically
Don't take Antibiotics unless double sure with blood tests
Indiscriminate usage may take a big toll in health, Life threatening
Ask your Doctors, if Antibiotics are must
Check  Internet for side effects
Better  believe  Internet, Not Doctors alone
Many Doctors  do Trial and Error Medication
Check  www.nlm.nih.gov, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed
www.umm.edu/ency/,  www.wrongdiagnosis.com etc for doubts
Nothing comes to light in India in Medical Field
