Beating throbs of desire
Stirring inside
Aching to hold and caress
To plant new seeds of life
Thoughts rushing in at the sight of you
Deepening as we embrace
Oh the hunger
Starving through lent as we abstained
Craving your body close
To melt together as one
Unions of fiery explosions
Hot steamy breath intermingling
Mouths attached together seamlessly
Hands wandering
Exploring without direction
Every valley
Every crevice
No taboos
Tingling sweating skin
Wanting everything
Needing only you
Tracing along your every curve
Lips lightly kissing
Nibbling for effect
Squirming this body beneath
Erotically moving in time
Rhythmically
The urgency of animal lust
Boiling higher
Magma of bodies mixed
Peaking to exhaustion
Breathing deeply, holding one another
Slowly descending passions frenzied path
Resting interlocked
Warm bodies touching, sweat mingling
To sleep
