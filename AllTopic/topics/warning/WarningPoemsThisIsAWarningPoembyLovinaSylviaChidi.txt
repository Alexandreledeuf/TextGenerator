Warning! warning! warning!
This is a warning
Stop me from yawning
There is no smoke
Without a choke
There is no secret
Without a regret
You can not be strong
If you've never been wrong
Anything ever hot
Brings upon hurt
This is a warning
Stop me from yawning
Unfailed prevention
Prevails redemption
Avoid temptation
Beware of those who are nice
So say the experienced wise
Everything comes with a price
This is a warning
Stop me from yawning
Run, have fun
While there is still sun!
