Our fires burn with a fearless rage!
They burn at the humans in this cursed age
From friends to hunted the dragons soon became
We are now called 'beast' and by no other name
What paranoia could have spawned their hate?
Was it always to be, dragons doomed to fate?
One thing is for certain, it is not our will!
They will soon find dragons are not so easy to kill
Engulfed in our flames shall be the humans' reward
If ever they should attempt to put dragons to the sword
