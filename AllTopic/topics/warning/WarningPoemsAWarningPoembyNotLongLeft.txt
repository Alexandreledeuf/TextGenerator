Give me some pen and paper
and I will shower you with many a sweet verse,
give me a torrid tale,
and out of my poets purse-
I shall produce words of worth.
Allow me to sit in my little room,
and open my heart to strangers
But never
pluck my feathers of inspiration,
for I would never let you in again
