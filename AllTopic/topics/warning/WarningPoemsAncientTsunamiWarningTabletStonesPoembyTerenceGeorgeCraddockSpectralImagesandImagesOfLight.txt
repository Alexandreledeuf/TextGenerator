large stones centuries old still stand on hillsides
with carved letters wise wisdom as messages
messages of love warnings carved into surfaces
patiently warning their aged witness surfaces
forgotten among young trees ancient tsunamis
warning stones stand warning across centuries
earthquake tsunamis will strike in swift waves
modern Japan heed our ancient wise warnings
