The smell of rain
hangs heavy in the air;
the sky steadily darkens.
Alert warnings focus
all eyes at the skies.
Faster and faster they move in,
clouds, dark, ominous,
voracious;
gobbling up the horizon
in foreboding, swirling masses.
A beastly spectre grows,
formed and escorted
by sudden unimaginable winds,
great claps of thunder and lightning,
and pelting torrents of rain and hail.
A mighty Dragon! cracks its tail at us
and then......
passes on by
leaving us grateful in the end;
relieved to have missed its hellish breath.
