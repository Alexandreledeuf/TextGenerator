If you want to retain your youth
don’t introduce him to your friends.
This a plain and simple truth
though your refusal may offend.
You cannot trust the best of friends
not to attempt to steal your guy.
Despite the fact that they pretend
that you can trust them completely.
Though you would trust them with your brass
and even with your credit card.
But men are in different class
in which you’ll find nothing is barred.
So if you want to keep your youth
believe my words they are the truth.
