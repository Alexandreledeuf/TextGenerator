Ni-cad and Lithium batteries
Have positive and negative posts
One collects, the other rejects
Within the electrolyte host
A type of semi-conduction
Takes place when charging each cell
â€˜til it's charge, puts halt to the barge
Of the electron flow as well
Man's body is like a battery
Where caustics and acids dwell
Unsettle? Toss in more metal
And watch the conduction swell
And when it finally burns out
Its computer turned to a toast
Doctor's shout, that without a doubt
His life was made better than most
