We're killing the World
And Ourselves!
So much greed,
So much lying,
And amongst, all the trouble frying,
We can see the Hate,
Promoted by the devils
That anticipate,
The fall of Democracy.
The devils that speak for 'the common good'
In a  thunder bolt of 'Hypocrisy'
When all they care about is Power for themselves,
And perpetuating, blurred futures by no one understood.
Pray and pray hard that there
May be some Robin Hood, amongst this madness
That will save the World from Hell
And all it's bitter sadness,
That there never come the day
When you can say
Once we had Democracy, but not today!
