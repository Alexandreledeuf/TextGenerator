Many to Christ refuse to bow
To Satan’s will yet fall
So few believe God’s warning now?
To heed Salvation’s call
Christ’s not in mode He’s long passé
It’s all outdated rules
Continuing the devil’s way
They walk to hell as fools
Yet those, who at life’s crossroads stand
With no one’s help in sight
Whisper for Jesus’ helping hand
And take the road that’s right
Yet most will say, that’s not my way
Religion’s for the weak
It’s not for me to kneel and pray
Though fortune will I seek
Rejecting now the hand of God
Refusing love’s true grace
Oblivious to Heaven’s Rod
They’ll never see God’s face
Instead they’ll see hell’s lake of flame
They’ll feel eternal pain
Where calling out The Saviour’s name
Will always be in vain
Humility the proud must seek
The blind God’s grace to see
The arrogant become now meek
So Christ can set us free
God’s testing iron and hardened steel
Refining silver and gold
Be warned, be wise, learn now to kneel
Before your flesh grows cold
