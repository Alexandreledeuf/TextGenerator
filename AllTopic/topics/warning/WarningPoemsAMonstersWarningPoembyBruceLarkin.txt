Send out your would-be heroes,
I've already faced a bunch.
If they come early, they're breakfast.
Late arrivals are lunch.
I'm the biggest, baddest monster
That you'll ever see.
The best tactic when I arrive
Is to drop everything and flee.
A flock of sheep and a herd of swine
Sounds kind of yummy.
Tasty, slow-moving villagers
Bring a smile to my tummy.
Stay on your side of the river,
And everything will be fine.
Dare to enter my magical forest,
And surely you'll be mine.
