I wish we understand the voices
of the birds as they give their
views on the dazzling look of the
earth from the sky maybe we know
how privileged   we are to have
dominion over it.
If only we understand the roars of
the Lions as they praise the splendid
look of the forest  we will stop cuting
and plant more trees.
If only we could listen to our hearts as
it praise the seductive,  moves of the
of the fishes we will show our waters
more respect..
