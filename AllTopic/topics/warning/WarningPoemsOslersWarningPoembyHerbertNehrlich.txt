It is preposterous indeed
that medicine  today does not
concern itself with health promotion,
it does, instead, go overboard
with illness interventions,
many of which do make things worse.
Sir William Osler   warned us not
to intervene when man is well,
but that is   what we do today!
Medicine does not believe
in the idea of wellness.
Each person is considered ill
unless proved otherwise
by use of  funds that can be commandeered.
It is a paradigm prostitution.
Routine check up is currently
a major industry, it is presented
as if prediction of the future
could entirely depend on it.
