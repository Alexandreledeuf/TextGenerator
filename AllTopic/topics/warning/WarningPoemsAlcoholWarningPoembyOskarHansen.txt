Alcohol Warning
A man, to prove that potatoes
had all the nourishment
needed to survive,
began eating this bulbous plant only.
Many dishes can be made of potatoes,
yet it has limitations
sautéed, baked, boiled and fried
it is still a potato.
To relieve the boredom he made
a drink of fermented potatoes,
I think it is called Mjød,
drank it got drunk, went out and
bought a bar of chocolate.
