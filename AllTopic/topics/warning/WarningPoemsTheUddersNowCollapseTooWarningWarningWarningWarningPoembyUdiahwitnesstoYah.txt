The Shoddy Times                    June 18 2012
Parent Company Collapse In The Making
Shoddy For Sale, As Parents Bail
And end to our company
Was made quite clear
As our trusted employers
Collected their gear
They had been selling
All our assets
Collecting their gold
While making us sweat
Now we're the mad ones
They lied to us so
We're now after them
By exposing their goal
They played both sides
They did it well, so
They played us pawns
Both Chiefs and Bro
Making us argue
For compromise
To save civility
Our morals their prize
They brought that home
They laughed at it so
The prize that we valued
While their fortunes did grow
And now there's chaos
Just what will they do
When they see us
Just walk away too
For with all their gold
They've set aside
It's all based on
Production and pride
While our morals stand firm
On our own treasure
They'll be coming back
Thinning bellies the measure
Then they'll decide
The values that count
To preach what they practice
Under our MOUNT!
