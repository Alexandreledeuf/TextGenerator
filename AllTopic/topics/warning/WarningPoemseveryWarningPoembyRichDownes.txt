No way of trying to find who to be.
No way leaves such a bad old cause
A memory shall now twirl
Even though it happens as every warning
Letting you just push me to my final limit
Like trying to break myself ever free
So that's what it's like for every warning
For it hurts with an aplomb
Just as the chances are gone
Final time of never fair
Even if it's true that you couldn't even care
Letting me have secrets that I'll keep
Not sure when to break free
Just not with a bliss
Guess you'll never finally want to see
Even though it happens as every warning
Letting you just push me to my final limit
Like trying to break myself ever free
So that's what it's like for every warning
So there's no-one who can finally even see
Low as you hurt me but that's further debatable, debatable
And that'll be nothing that's ever new
No way of making love due so
Even though it happens as every warning
Letting you just push me to my final limit
Like trying to break myself ever free
So that's what it's like for every warning
