Are you not frightened by looking at this picture?
This is not for today but indication for coming future
Have we not deceived our mother earth and brought havoc?
Natural wealth is fast depleting and running out of stock
Tress can show displeasure by looking barren
Ponds can show it by going dry even
But it is very difficult to guess mentality of human being
What a level to lower and disasters to bring?
Nature gives an early warning for any of the consequences
Volcano may make its intent known as it is not by chance
Cyclone sends early warning with prior arrival rain and storms
Human mind acts with connivance and doesnâ€™t even warn
We are facing natural wrath as cycle has completely changed
Sea level is rising fast with alarm and becomes mismanaged
River waters bring untold sufferings and add to the woes
This is how our misery is multiplying and goes
We face the world with two way deception
On one side we make drive for forestation
And on the other side allow for deforestation
Eco balance is thus disturbed and making way for destruction
Green forest land is set on fire
Human greed has expanded to acquire
All forest land for cultivation and use
Leaving behind suicidal notes for us to choose
Time is yet within our hands
We must think fresh change our trend
Nature must be preserved at any cost
Else everything on earth may be lost
