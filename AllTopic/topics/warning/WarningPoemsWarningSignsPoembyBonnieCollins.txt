Caution yield right of way
Warning Danger
the signs were all blinded
by the sun in the sky
After you finally knew you
had won my heart was it
then that made you decide
your challange was over?
Living by all the rules, obliging
any and all rules of love never
seeing the Danger signs listed
my gurad rail of love collapsed
into your soul
Many years of loving is a lifetime
of devotion a sancation to harbor
a broken heart
Even with life taking its yield, and
its caution, and Danger, still could
not prevent nor guarentee a gift
of love, I know that now.............
