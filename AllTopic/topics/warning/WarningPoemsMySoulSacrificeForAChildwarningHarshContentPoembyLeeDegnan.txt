it was in those beautiful
cool eyes
the birth of my madness
and an innocence demise
you had no right to bring me
into your cruel little world
i was just a little girl
i was just a little girl
didn't anyone hear me f*cking
scream
at night, shattering their selfish
pleasant dreams?
no use was it crying for my mommy
i don't want to hear you're sorry
i don't want to hear you're sorry
bared naked was my
little soul
you took whatever good in me
and raped it whole
no longer a person but this shell
who'd love to watch you burn in hell
love to watch you burn in hell
nothing to stop you from
what you did to me
seething hate for you
from which I'll never be free
I'll never grow up to be someone's blushing bride
no one would've cared if i died
no one would've cared if i died
nowadays still in dreams
you will creep
louder I heard your laughter
when you made me weep
inside i'm still that little girl
trapped in your f*cked up world
trapped in your f*cked up world

I know what I wrote here
isn't the most pleasant of themes
but this is what haunts me
whenever I hear a child scream....
or when I walk by the TV
when the news is on,
it might be a breaking story, but
believe me I know what's going on
Child abuse, in any form, runs
rampant in every country
yet efforts to avoid this horror, in my
opinion, seems rather paltry
God forbid if such a predator,
no matter what you do,
were to target any one of your kids
or anyone else close to you.
I wish I didn't know this
or even that I ever care
I guess it doesn't matter as much
if you can't say you've ever been there
Not here to win any
popularity contests,
or to win the Nobel Prize,
I only wish you to remember this
when you look into a child's eyes
Because if you forsake a child
by ignoring what you hear
it will be the end of human decency
within that child's tears
I'm bearing my soul, naked,
for all the world to see,
if for even only one child from
this fate, would ever be free.
