First warning
Sunday,23rd December 2018
I wish the world to be different
when the bell of the new year may present
the rising sun in a different color
to lead us with an honor
Let us look back with no surprise
it was filled with the promises
yet something more was to be done
even though it has ceremonially gone
It was really memorable
for all of to struggle
and remember as an individual
nature remained really cruel
Was it of our doing?
nature was really playing
with the most devastating arm
and causing great harm
jungle fire. floods and natural disturbances
it played really against with destructive forces
we all prayed for the welfare of human beings
we are taking it as the first warning
