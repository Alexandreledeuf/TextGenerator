The regal “ Ego”
Sat in a tuft
Not long ago
To anger rather swift
Its fine and princely sure
Yet an Achilles’ heel
For the second person to ensure;
Twist around fingers I feel!
Yes oft I observe Great men fall
To the trap of flattery
Although otherwise tall
Words as if a bribery!
Regal the manipulator
Knowing the pitfalls ahead
Try to but futile warn of predator
Waiting to make his rose bed!
What more can unconditional love desire
Without uncaring sit by his warm fire
Even if burdens cannot share;
His patient love needless to retire.
