On a bright sunny day
With the light wind flowing
A Cutie white cloud of peace
Peeked from the sky to play
With the wind
And that Carried her away
Too far
That landed them in nowheres land
Down is the hill
Top is the bright sun shine falling on
Peak of the hill.
All of a sudden
Darkness gripped her way
And a storm of silence could be heard
She saw that she was surrounded
By black clouds from all sides of rain
Which were ready to pour out angrily on her
It seemed like tiger ready for an attack.
With dagger in hand
To pounce on her to kill.
Meekly stood the cutie cloud
Watching and
Remembered her mothers warning
Not to cross the border line
Which she crossed playfully
All of a sudden
The swirling wind dispersed
Away the black clouds
Surrounding her
And she was given a way
To fly away.
She flew away so fast as she was lighter than air
That leaving all the black clouds at dismay.
She reached reached on her mammas  lap
And cried to her heart full.
Mamma said
Be careful next time
Don't get carried away by the wind!
