Don't call me just yet
Let me
Take a shower first
So I can polish and perfume
My slightly dry skin.
Don't call me just yet
Let me
Open my bottle
Of fine French wine,
Then sit down to dine
On a dinner fit for a king.
Then, and only then
Will I be ready to
Discuss how I might
Be able to help those
Suffering starving strangers.
