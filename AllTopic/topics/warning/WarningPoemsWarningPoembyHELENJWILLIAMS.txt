Before you read my poetry
I want you to understand,
I, m not a high school scholar
I preferred the beach, the sun & sand.
So as you read & find mistakes
Please keep your opinions to yourself,
Cause my dictionary & other books
Lay forgotten on the shelf.
Forget the missing dots & dashes -
The capitals & commas,
For all these words come from the heart
And to me that's all that matters! ! !
