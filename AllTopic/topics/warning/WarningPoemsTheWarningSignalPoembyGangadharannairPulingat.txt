Where thoughts are about fear
Where stress becomes routine
The anger, lust, revenge
And vices tries to conquer
Human heart complains and asks
Stop stop and make things easy
It depends upon my health
The human heart, its performance
You makes it dangerous to sustain
You makes it feel disturbed
When you opt for foolish struggles
The heart says you are in danger
Hear, the wonderful organ
Highly sensitive to emotions
Keep the emotions less stressful
Where your speed must control
Otherwise heart will call it
To stop the journey itself.
