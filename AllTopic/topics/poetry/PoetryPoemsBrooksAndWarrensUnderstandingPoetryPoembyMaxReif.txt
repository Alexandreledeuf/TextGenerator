These pages are a river
down which a  young girl watches
her lover disappear,
and someone meditates upon
crude rhythms of a city street
and finds a suffering God.
The seasons change
and change again,
a pear tree reaches high,
a cock crows, and the chickens sit
beside a red wheelbarrow.
All the seasons of the soul
are ripened and transmuted here,
and I, the reader, disappear,
as well, into the flow.
