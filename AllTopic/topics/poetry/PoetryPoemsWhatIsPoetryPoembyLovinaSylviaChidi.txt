What is poetry?
I say it is mega-magnetic fun
When words play and tend to run
It is mega-magnetic fun
Yes mega-magnetic fun
When readers show they are appreciative
Of playful words which are narrative
I say it is mega-magnetic fun
When readers have come & gone
And all the votes have been cast and drawn
I say it is mega-magnetic fun
When writers become inventive
With or without any material incentive
I say it is mega-magnetic fun
That is what poetry is about
It is mega-magnetic fun
