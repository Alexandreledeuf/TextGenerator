Have you looked beneath the surface,
Of the greatest poems and verse,
And seen that almost always,
There seems to be an anti animal curse,
But have you not noticed,
That 'The charge of the Light Brigade',
Is about the Charge the Chickens made,
That 'Dulce et decorem est',
Is about the war in which the chickens were the best,
That Wordsworths 'Daffodils',
is about the Chickens in the hills,
That 'The Owl and the Pussycat',
Is about a Chicken,
And that is that!
