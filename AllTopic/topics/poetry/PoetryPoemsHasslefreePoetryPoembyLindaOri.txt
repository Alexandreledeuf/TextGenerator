Poems, like poets, have much to say -
They may describe a rainy day,
They may sing love songs light and gay
Or speak of deep despair;
Some poems are short and oh, so sweet -
Some complex  and indescreet,
Some say nothing at all concrete
Just words that make no sense;
The poet knows what the poet means -
He may be writing about his dreams,
Or nothing more than a hill of beans
To catch the readers eye;
Why must poets follow rules?
Rhyme, and meter  and other tools
Sometimes dull  poetic jewels
Detracting from the flow;
Just open up and let it fly,
You'll never know unless you try -
Write poems that make the readers cry
Regardless of the form;
I like to call it hasslefree -
This personal type of poetry
That has a style uniquely 'me' -
Totally unpredictable!
