For us there is an expression
Of significant emotions
Emotion is alive in poems
Not in the poet's dark stained past.
Emotions are not personal,
Art is also not personal;
What he writes is not Life itself
But Life's emotion translated.
Poetry is not seen or heard
But to be seen through & heard from;
It shows us a picture, tells a tale
Though that is not it in itself.
You who doubt of this being so
But have a mind to conceive thoughts
And sensibilities to feel
The disorder, the futility,
Meaninglessness and suffering,
The mysteries of existence -
You and only you will find peace:
In poems we are all reconciled.
