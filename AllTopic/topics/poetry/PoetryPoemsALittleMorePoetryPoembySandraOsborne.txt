Funny, I’ve been writing
For a very long time.
I’ve written about love
I’ve written about hate
I’ve written about war
I’ve written about peace
I’ve written about snow
I’ve written about time
I’ve written about the meaning
Of my death.
And I’ve written some lines
That I should have erased,
I’ve written about running,
And leaving this place.
I’ve written a thousand words
Trying to understand men
And another thousand
To understand sin.
But mostly I write
To understand life
To feel what its for
To know what is right.
And the few more words
That I have In my pen,
Is all I have;
My poems and my friends.
