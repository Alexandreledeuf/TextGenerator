I printed all my poems out and put them in a book.
I've placed it on the table in the hopes you'll take a look.
You know you'll find my soul there beneath the cover page.
You'll read about my pleasures, my heartaches and my rage.
I know you don't like poetry and this I understand
but how can you not want to peek into my  ''wonderland''?
If you would take a minute and peruse a page or two
I think you'd be suprised to read the thoughts I have of you.
I've tried to make it easy and I know you see it there.
I'll wait it out and hope you see these things I need to share.
I suppose I know the answer is in where I place my book.
I'll put it in the bathroom......then you're sure to take a look!
