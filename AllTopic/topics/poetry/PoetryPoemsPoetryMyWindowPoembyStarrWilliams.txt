If youâ€™ve ever tried to catch a cloud,
to ride a rainbow,
to save the sunshine in a jar.
Then you know how it feels
to strive to capture the deep thoughts
that flitter across your mind.
The shadows of thought are not
easily distinguished.
Even now,
as I sit here, just me and these thoughts,
these deep thoughts
roam the hills and valleys of my mind,
always just out of reach.
But, from the shadows of deep thinking,
Springs a ray of sunshine,
I can only seem to catch with my pen.
But when I read over what I have written,
it is only a shadow of the shadow.
For behind my poems,
are real thoughts,
real feelings,
seen only in glimpses.
For poetry is my window to the world,
And to myself.
