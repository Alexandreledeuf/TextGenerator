Apologies, folks
for slipping this one in
under the guise of a poem
but isn't it great
to open this site's window
and find 20 poems
by 20 poets
several for the first time
making a fantastically rich hour or two
just reading them
such as never could have happened
a few years ago
(three cheers for webmaster)
I know that some of us
write umpteen poems a day
but could you please
space them out, just one or two each day
so I can read them without hurrying?
Apologies again, and
consider this as really
a poem
in praise of poetry?
which it is.
