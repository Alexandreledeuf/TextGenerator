There is a streak of poetry in my vein
Just as there is poetry in the air
And there is poetry in the rain
There is poetry in the first smile of dawn
And poetry in the soft rays of the moon
There is poetry in a blade of grass
And poetry in the balmy evening breeze,
There is poetry riding on the roaring bluegreen waves
And poetry whispering in dark mountain caves
There is poetry in the smile of a child
Just as there is poetry in the deep green wild
Poetry is music and music is magic â€¦..
Poetry means everything to me
My sweet, tantalizing, bewitching lady.
