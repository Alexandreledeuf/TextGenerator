The famous Poet Laureate
of North Dakota State
has been suspended on full pay
just because one merry day
attending a writers' conference
at a restaurant, under the influence
of the Bacchic nectar he'd imbibed
there were incidents, yet undescribed.
But his students have Larry Woiwode's promise
to deal with their theses on Dylan Thomas
and other poets. Ironic, it must seem
to all those drunk with poetry, in Academe?
