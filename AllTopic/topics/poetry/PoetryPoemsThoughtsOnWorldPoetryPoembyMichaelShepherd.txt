To coin a metaphor:
It's like a Protestant
wandering into a Catholic church
and hearing someone just out of the confessional
muttering 32 Hail Mary's as instructed
huddled in the nearest pew,
and thinking
hey once is enough...
for some, a ceaseless act of worship;
for some, a wake-up call;
the intention
could be the same
