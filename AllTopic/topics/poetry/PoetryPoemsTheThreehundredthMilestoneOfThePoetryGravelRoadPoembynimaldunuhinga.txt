I am tired but I like to continue.
My posture is feeble
but I want to finish the journey
walking up to the dead end?
I must thank the poemhunter website and all my fellowship
who gave a space to this tiny animal to walk along the road
without any obstacles.
I feel like a newly wed among my cyber colleagues
and I was surprised how in one's day collected so many friends?
