As one of the wrinkly-crumblies
-W.A.S.P. without the sting -
it puzzles me: in poetry,
does one good **** really deserve another?
fifty years ago - fifty, for ****'s sake -
when I was an army cadet
some squaddies used it every other word
-and since we were in Signals,
it ****ing delayed ****ing battle-orders ****ing long enough
to ****ing mow down a ****ing platoon...
and longer in ****ing Morse... - - -...
and as for ****ing semaphore...makes your ****ing arms flag...
my liberal friends
who never admit to shock
say 'it shows a.... lack of imagination';
now that's ****ing serious in ****ing poets.
outside the ****ing English-spitting world
it must seem ****ing strange
that the most-loved ****ing bodily action
is used as a ****ing swear-word -
what have you ****ers got against ****ing?
or is it a term of ****ing praise maybe?
and why still a shock-word
amongst you young lot
who get a lot more ****ing ****ing than we ever did? Dammit.
Philologically,
is it still heard
as ****ing onomatopoeic?
which makes it pretty near to ****ing S&M I'd say?
could you****ers (whom I love for your interest in poetry
I have to say)
give me, as a reasonable ****er,
a ****ing explanation?
it would be ****ing useful
poetically
And who the **** is this
'American realist' poet Charles F***offski
whom you admire so much, anyway?
