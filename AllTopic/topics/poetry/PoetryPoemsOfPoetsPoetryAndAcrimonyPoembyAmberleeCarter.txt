when i think
of all the clean words
i used to use on you
and how
they've become vernacular
for having been attached
to one so lowly
i think
how poetry will never be
uttered in the same manner
instead
the language takes on your stench
poor english venom
and cigarette smoke
i've dissected
abbreviated so much
the vowels now longer sound
long or short
they just whimper
