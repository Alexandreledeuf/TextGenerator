those wishing to learn writing good haiku should
start first by writing spooky haikus;
midnight
bus leaves me in the shadow
of a haunted house
midnight park
the swing suddenly
creaks
dark corridor
passing by the unit
a man hung himself
ghost festival
hell money trails
the night wind
night clothesline
below the white table clothes
feet
