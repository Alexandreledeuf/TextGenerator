why poetry?
to realise that
a simple smile
can mean so
many things
and interpreted
in so many ways
that there is
always a fresh way
to look at things
the way god
has been able
to give each of us
a new way to
experience  things
a cross puzzle
he  challenges us
to find the uniqueness
he  has meant for
all of us to be
languages, geographies
genes, religions
universes, angels...
every facet that helps
a diamond to sparkle
its own way
