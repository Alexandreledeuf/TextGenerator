Inspired  by poem of Daniel Brick'—‘'Du Fu Visits Anne Yun''
Your visit to Anne Yun
So special
Your distant daughter
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Du Fu,
You are the warrior
Your valour
keeps guard
Against the evil forces
That corrupts the   land
You leave to your descendants
A legacy
A  garden  of lush green
Where flowers bloom
And pure sun light   falls
Your youngest daughter
Whom you have never seen
Finds the magic
Of your words
Poetry written in breeze
Poetry holds her
Your legacy flows like river
A river that never dies
Clouds collect water from river
They go floating far
and far to unknown lands
And poetry writes for them who read
Poetry lives for poetry
And daughter remembers
Du Fu
