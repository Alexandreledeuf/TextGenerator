a real poet
who harbours
a message
takes his glory
from the sun
shines day in
and day out
lighting up
the graces of the world
his own dignified way
come rain,
come thunder,
come lightning
he  never lets go
of his vision
lighting up the world
with triumph
enthusiasm
uplifted spirit
a real poet
helps others
find a path
with life
helps the
world realise
the power
of verses
- in realising
life
in so many levels
