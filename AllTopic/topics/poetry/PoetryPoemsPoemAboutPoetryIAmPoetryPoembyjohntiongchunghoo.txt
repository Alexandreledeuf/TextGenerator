i am poetry
a baby naked
crying my heart
out as  i am thrust
into the new world
echoing to it
another realm
i love the way i am
every cell of myself
because i love myself
i am loved in return
i am so loved i am
on the lips of
everybody
bouncing in
their joys and sadness,
triumphs and failures
to give them self worth
of the most meaningful kind
- the tramps, the tycoons
the princes, the princesses,
the secret lovers
the kings and the queens
i am poetry
i am a baby loved
for my innocence, rawness
i am clothed in
a million different ways
i have no complaints
so long as they bring
out the rainbow in me
words rhymed or unrhymed
do not bother me
suits, dresses,
saris, kimonos
kilt, loinclothes,
fundoshi
you name it,
i have been in them
i am poetry
i come out of everybody
a thousand million strains of
individual heaven and hell
of all, my worst nemesis
ae those who are
so lost in themselves
they put pants on my head,
socks on my hands,
gloves on my feet
hang a million
bright accessories
on me  and proudly
declare me poetry
