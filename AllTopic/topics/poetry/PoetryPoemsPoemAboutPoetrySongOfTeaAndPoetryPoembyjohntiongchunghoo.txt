the refreshing taste of
dawn mist and sunshine,
mountain loam rolled up
in tender brown leaves
and now unveiled through
spring water
they are the simple joy
that raises  the morning sun
up into my sky
i dont need that many
readers, just a few who
care to weigh every word
to see how much they are worth
they  too are my tea that elevates
the sun up my sky
