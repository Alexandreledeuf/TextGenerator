I thought poetry is
-nubile beauty where lustfulness decorate unstable life
-nude bathing of a juvenile girl in the raining pond
-wrestle mania game of beauty queen Charlotte Flair
-heartthrob sex game of porn actress Angela White
I thought poetry is
-late reaching ship of Apollo Temple and more philosophic discussion of Socrates
-drinking hemlock of Socrates in smiling on the bed of dead truth
I thought poetry is
-as the usual, sun rising and setting down
-as usual moonlight honeymoon at night
-intercourse of animal and breeding offspring
I thought poetry is
-war for the country and religion, remembered martyrdom
-greeting death smiling on the belief of getting heaven
-killing people to satisfy God or the kings-queens will
I thought poetry is
-new inventions and discovering on the nobel prizes subjects
-Oscar winning film, actors, actresses and red carpet walkers
I thought poetry is
-Holy verses of God for the wise peoples and hymn reciting for the others
-buying and selling of love and hate or of peace and irritation
My thinking is just thinking
As like as new born baby's blink!
But poetry is poetry,
more than any thinking, many more;
On its path
Poetry is independent fully
