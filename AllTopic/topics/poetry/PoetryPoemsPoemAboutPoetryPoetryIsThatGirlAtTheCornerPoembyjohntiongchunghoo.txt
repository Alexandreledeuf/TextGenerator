poetry is that
schoolgirl
junior high
you have
known for
three years
but never talk to
she is always
at  the corner
of everywhere
by herself
living out
the world
of her own
harbouring
a dream
beautiful as
rainbow
poetry is
that junior
school girl
at the corner
of your class
you never talk to
but have always
wanted to
poetry is
that girl
by herself
harbouring
a world too
entrancing for
her to extricate
herself from
poetry is
that gentle girl
at a little corner
who has an
apple garden
to be explored
and savoured
but would rather
keep quiet about it
poetry is that boy
who makes the first
move to lift the first
page of her life
to give her life
another dimension
and lets his mind
be showered
with all her graces
