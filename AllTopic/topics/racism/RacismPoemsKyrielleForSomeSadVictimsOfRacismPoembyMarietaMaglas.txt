When those  victims of racism are cruelly abused,
Their faces look so sad and they don't know they are used.
A fear of things makes them inept to protect their space.
Sometimes, they die in search for another dwelling place.
The crisis and the wars made these people immigrants.
Discriminated, blacks and whites look so innocent.
Their Stolen Generation grows and lives in disgrace.
Sometimes, they die in search for another dwelling place.
They need equality and peace in this world to live
And they pray to have the mercy and love our Lord can give.
To protest in the streets, they run their life steeplechase.
Sometimes, they die in search for another dwelling place.
