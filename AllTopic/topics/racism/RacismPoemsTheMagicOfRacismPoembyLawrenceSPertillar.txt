It hides the facts,
And exposes insecurities.
With a remorse,
No one is willing to admit or take back.
But at night...
It allows sex between diverse races,
To explore their differences
Under sheets to heat and sweat.
And this is done,
Without a public forum.
And the good of the act,
No one regrets...
Even thrusting to get wet!
The magic of racism may swell into hate.
But no one who is tempted to taste,
Regrets the nakedness of it!
