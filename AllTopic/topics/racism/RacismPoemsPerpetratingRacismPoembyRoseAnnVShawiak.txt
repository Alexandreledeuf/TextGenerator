Wondering at the rudeness in people of power, thinking
they are better than those they are supposed to be
serving.
It's hard to imagine how people can feel that way,
while disrespecting others who are gentle and cooper-
ative to a fault, treating them in turn with the utmost
respect.
Just can't believe some people's kids, impolite, no
manners or common decency towards others in their lives.
Horrible and totally horrendous people, perpetrating
the racism that's keeping peace from happening in our
world.
