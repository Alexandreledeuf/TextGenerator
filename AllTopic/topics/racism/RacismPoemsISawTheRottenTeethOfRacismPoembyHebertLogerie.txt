I saw its ugly head
And witnessed its action.
I saw the color of its forehead
And the mental degradation
That it can cause.
No need to pause,
I saw the size of its teeth.
This beast moves like a serpent.
At times behaves like a thief,
Who's not afraid to rant.
I saw the elephant in the room.
This is scary; let me get the broom,
To chase it, let me get something,
So I can expel it from the ring.
I saw the sad smile of racism,
It is sneaky like a sick possum,
Who wants to hide the body in the drum.
I am warning you that it is worse than a cancer.
It can poison the children of Mother Nature.
I saw the stand-up reptile, the grand wizard,
The archaic ginormous lizard.
I've survived to see its ugly head
And to witness its action and inaction
I saw the color of its forehead
And its indiscriminate destruction.
I saw the penguins doing the moonwalk,
They gestured and also attempted to talk.
