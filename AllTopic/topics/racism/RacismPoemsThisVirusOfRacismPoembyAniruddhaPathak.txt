Thinking was I of this newest scare
That has stolen away people's dare—
The deadly virus COVID nineteen
For which we may soon find a vaccine.
But doubt I've of racism virus,
That has been one of most vicious,
Nor is there a vaccine known to fight,
Nor may one sooner come to fair light.
Nor ever an antibiotic
To defeat the devil's lethal kick—
A virus that's proved as dangerous
As has been one of most infectious—
A virus that took its roots so firm,
Thanks our endemic indifference
To take a solid action at once,
This virus alas of racism!
