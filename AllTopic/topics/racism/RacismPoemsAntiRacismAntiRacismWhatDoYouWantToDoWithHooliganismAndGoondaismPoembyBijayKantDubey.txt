Anti-racism,
Anti-racism demos,
Okay,
But what,
What these to do
With violent demonstrations,
Arson and booty
And thuggery
Setting on fire and running
For cover and shelter?
Under the pretext of all these,
The politicos will come light,
Get the media coverage,
Will turn into spokesmen overnight,
National heroes
As this is the time of
Making a name free of cost
Without striving for.
What this nonsense for,
What this hooliganism,
Thuggery
And booty,
Where are they going,
What are they doing
Under the banner of race and racism?
