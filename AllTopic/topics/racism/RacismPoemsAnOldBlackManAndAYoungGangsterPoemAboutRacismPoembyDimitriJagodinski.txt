I was in my office one day
And an old black truck driver came my way
As we were talking a ganster walked in
Cussing all the white men
The old black man looked at him
He said boy where have you been
I was born in racial segragation
Whipped day in and day out
You do not know what your talking about
I am tired of you so called gansters
Crying about racism
You were never put in a cage like a hamster
You get scholarships
Business loans
Affirmitive action
Cars and cell phones
I had to work my tail off to earn the things I have
You just cry racism and they give in to your lies while you laugh
I forgave the white people along time ago
They were fools that needed to know
What wrong was done
Now they try making amends
And we in turn reversed the racism
Become a real man
Watch over your family
Work hard and honestly
Earn your keep
God will make you reap
Forgive the past
Help make the future last
Love your brothers and sisters
Respect your elders
End the hatred you did not earn
The hatred that I once scorned
Because hatred will eat you inside
And stupidity like racism will never die.
Because your actions keep racism alive
