Geography and Racism
I have only seen
Africa from the deck
Of a ship sailing by
What I know comes
From books
White men meeting
In darkest Africa
The merchants followed
Soldiers
And colonisation
Racism is contagious and
It settled in the mind
Of Europeans
The illness widened to
Include everyone not white
Now we live
With our trespasses
It truly is a burden
