Racism is still alive
They just be concealing it
Inequality is still prevalent
Systematic efforts
Can’t conceal its relevance
Injustice is rife
Even the blind can see it
Racism never died
Society was fed
Multicultural lies
Some speak out against it
Only when it’s politically convenient
But political correctness can’t mask
Society’s underlying institutionally racist elements
Racial profiling, discrimination, xenophobia & stereotypes
Live in the mindsets
Of men & women
Even some children
Can’t see past pigmentation
Racism is still alive
And well
Just ask those discriminated against on a daily basis
Because their skin color
Will always be different.
