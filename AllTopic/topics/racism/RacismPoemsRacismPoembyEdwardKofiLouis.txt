Racist prejudice had blinded the minds of mankind,
Thus forgetting the enormous contributions of one another on this earth;
Is it the colour of my skin or the colour of your skin?
Who made them all?
Racist, racist! Racism! !
I grew up in a family which respects all colours,
So i don't see why we should condemn what the Creator created!
And He is the ONLY ONE who knows the secret of these colours.
