We have met before
And you closed the door
Imagine the pain I had to endure
So this is my song
For I have done no wrong
We have met before
And you left me feeling sore
My only crime was to be black
So while the wind keeps track
There are no words that can offer a cure
This is the bit
I call Internet shit
And it doesn't take one with wit
To understand the racism that sweeps the floor
A picture and some words is all that I wore
And you never even found out if I was a bore
We have met before
Immediately you thought of me as unpolished and raw
And the negativity just flowed in waves more and more
A picture and some words is all it takes
For you to conclude that I am a complete fake
And in your narrow minded head you have baked
Internet racism leaving me with a sour taste wide awake
