It would seem racism abounds
everywhere. In this century
and from the earliest times.
Suspicious of others who do
not belong. Different culture,
customs or language. Outsiders
like the Barbarians were despised.
Not only for their appearance
and culture but they didn't
speak Greek.
Today, the Can't Breathe movement
must be applauded. There is no
room for racists in civilised
societies. The world is now a
smaller place where infringement
of human rights is instantly
recognised.
