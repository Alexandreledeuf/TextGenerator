I write and put down on paper whats on my mind, I'll say  a few words none to be kind. I hate racism people of that act, I do not care what color you are. You could be white, brown, or black.A paradox has open it's door, people think who started this war.Inorgance is very bliss your conscience is telling you to listen to this, your heart we need to make a new start take part and be hate free. It's start with a vocie, it begins with me. It is time to put our hearts to  the test  and see if it brings out our best and lets  put racism to rest. Our anger and hatered have been release, cease! ! , And bring peace. Pray to god and ask him above, ''Do you  not  think it is time to spread the love ''. Make yourself proud speak up loud let it be known let the love be shown. Racism needs to end.
