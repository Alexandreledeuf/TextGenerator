racism is the rich man's lash
on the poor man's back!
yea, it's hard down in the projects.
it's hard down on factory row too.
and it's hard out in them
fruit and vegetable picking fields!
it's hard in the unemployment line!
cant nobody pay the rent...
and the rich man keeps laughing,
selling us out for profit,
selling our souls and our dreams!
IT HAS TO STOP!
