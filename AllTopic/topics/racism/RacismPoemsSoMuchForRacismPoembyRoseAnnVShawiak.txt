Signs appearing in the middle of an afternoon rush
at Wendy's.
People of all colors, creeds, religions, and races
together, laughing, talking, getting along fantastically.
So much for racism here in America, it is just a lie
perpetrated by obama and all his racist friends.
Letting the entire world know, that here we accept one
another as people, individuals only.
Nothing going on here, no hatred or intolerance, only
what obama and George Soros are paying people to do.
They're trying to make it look like America is prejudiced,
yet it is the farthest thing from the truth.
Only problem we have here now are the muslims who are
intolerant, prejudiced and racists, wanting sharia law.
Yet it goes completely against our Constitution, and the
morals of our country, it will never be the law here!
The world can count on it, as God Blesses America, the
home of the brave and the land of the free!
