Racism, Racism, Racism
You give a human sorrow and hate
Racism, Racism, Racism
Look at what you've done and look at their state
Racism, Racism, Racism
You are evil and sharp as a knife
Racism, Racism, Racism
You play with human's life
Racism, Racism, Racism
Why are you so cruel?
Racism, Racism, Racism
You are nothing but a fool!
Racism, Racism, Racism
Why judge by colour?
Racism, Racism, Racism
You are horrendously disgraceful but hate to admit you've got the power
Racism, Racism, Racism
Why are you here?
Racism, Racism, Racism
You're not wanted so go die with fear.
