The racist cloaks his loathing thoughts
behind deceiving eyes
Those men who once wore hoods and robes
Today wear shirts and ties
Their methods changed but yet and still,
Their mission is the same
Today they lynch with politics,
the racist's favorite game
Divide and conquer is their plan
to keep minorities
From seeing that the forest lies
just shortly past the trees
Racism lurks within the press,
courthouses, banks and schools
Black folks convinced that all is well
have certainly been fooled
A racist underground exists,
a chilling fact indeed
They seek to kill, steal and destroy,
We can't let them succeed
