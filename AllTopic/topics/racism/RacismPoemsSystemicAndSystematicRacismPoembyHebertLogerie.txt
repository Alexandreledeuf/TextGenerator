Racism is both systemic and systematic
Racism is a systemic and endemic cancer
Racism is a very painful and odious chancre
Covid-19 is both systemic and systematic
Black people have been under attack
For many centuries, it is time to react
Because we are fed up, we're tired
Of being oppressed. There's too much hatred
We're sick of the overt and covert bias
We can no longer stand for the chaos
Society needs to clean up the mess
We're tired of the pandemic racism
And the systemic and systematic racism
We're tired of the pandemic viruses
And the systemic and systematic viruses
Las Casas was a killer, not a protector
Of human rights or human dignity
Las Casas was a cancer, not a Monsignor
Who stood for justice and equality
Black lives matter and everybody matters
We are not cowards, we are fighters
We will die for justice and freedom
We'll protest, fight and we shall overcome.
