there are two things that i fear
one that i could not see
the other i would rather not see
they are ghosts and racists
the first i could fend with faith
the second with thank god
his abundant milk of patience
racists are a society's cancer
debilitating, energy sapping
draining peace
whenever one is around
you are robbed of your vitality
the environment dries up
and things grind to a halt
the racists could stare into
the starry night and are
consumed by its darkness
rather than the glitters of  stars
god's rich graces fail to reach them
their earth cracks and harvests fail
few walk the middle path
sooner or later they let loose
the ghosts they rear in them
- the vortex of negative charges
stone on cogs of wheel
the factory where the devils work
day and night to fuel and heat up hell
