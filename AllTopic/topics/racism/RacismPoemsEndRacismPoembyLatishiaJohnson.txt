The eyes of hate stares down at you
with so much dispproval and it makes you
feel uncomfortible and unwelcome,
Racism is major and it has to STOP
its like you want afican americans to
be ashamed to dislike their color because
you dislike it.
Unlike other people who are
afaid to stand up for whats right
im PROUD to be a young black women.
Racism has been going on since 1955 and longer,
Does anyone care about how racism affects alot of people
and, how is brings some of us down as Afican Americans,
As Afican Americans walk down the street all you hear and see is people of other races throwing the N' word at them and fingering them.
it hurts sometimes to see people disapproval of black people but like my mom always told me what doesnt kill you, makes you stronger.
Its time for a change....
END RACISM
