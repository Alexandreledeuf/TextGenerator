We are fed up with this
Brand of protesters,
This looters brigade,
The rowdy and unruly elements
And anti-socials
Always in hunt for something,
To make out from this
Vandalism,
The chaos and crisis,
The pandemonium and hullabaloo,
The rogues and thieves.
To protest is not to politicize it,
Improvise the situation
To be benefitted from,
To give it a political colour,
To protest is not to break,
Loot and to be thugs,
Destroy business,
Now say you,
When will this looters' brigade
Come to a stop,
When will these vandalizers?
