Ever since modern man
drove the last
neanderthals
from their cave's
into the sea
the Straight's of Gibraltar
have witnessed
what man
in his quest to rid himself
of what he fear's
the most
that when he dies
he doesn't die but spreads
instead this curse
that none should live and
living died each culture's night.
