Racism
Eats you up inside.
Plays upon
you're insecure mind.
Perceptions of threats
that are not there.
You hate his dark skin
and the black man's hair.
You hate the white skin
of the blue-eyed boy.
This hatred -
you taste -
it does more
than annoy.
It consumes
you're very
identity.
Eats you up
psychologically.
Prepares you
to murder
indescriminately.
And destroys
all who are touched
so
tragically...
