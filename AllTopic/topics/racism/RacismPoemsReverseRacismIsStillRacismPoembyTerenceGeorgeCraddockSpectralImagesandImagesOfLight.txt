racism perpetrated in the name
of past injustices is still racism
racism justified now in the name
of past evils crimes is still racism
a racist is still a racist regardless
of any all justifications quoted
all racism is a violation
of the right to equality
belonging to all humanity
all racism is a cruel violation
of the sacred right to equality
belonging to all our humanity
