Wise words from a wise old fellow for as long as I live I'll recall
He said if you are a Racist to one Race then you are a racist to all
You cannot be a racist to one Race and claim you are not racist in any way
Few racists like to be called racist we are not racist you hear them say.
Racism is born of ignorance and ignorance we know to the ignorant is bliss
That difference make people more interesting the point of that some seem to miss
Our days can be measured in minutes and our lives can be measured in hours
And those we look on as different their blood is no less red than ours.
When some people talk of a fair go they do not mean a fair go for all
But a fair go for their own kind only in their ways some are very small
People should not be disadvantaged due to their place of birth or their Race
In the Human World of the future for such there will not be a place.
That I do pity those who are racist may seem quite a strange thing to say
In the darkness they surround themselves with they seem to be losing their way
In shaping the future of the Human World any part they are not destined to play
Their thinking it does seem outdated in the multicultural World of today.
