Pressure of racism flows from mouths of those who proclaim
to be politically correct and who are in fact, just the
opposite.
They are found to be most often, the bigots and racists
filled with hatred, anger and jealousy.
A relationship between all people should be looked at as
equals and not by color or nationality at all.
Maybe then this imbalance of all people will straighten
itself out, and rightly so.
This hatred for all mankind needs to be ended and the only
way to do this is to realize we are all equal in the eyes
of God.
It is our human failure alone that purports this war of
racism here on earth.
