Some things never change suppose life is this way
Racism is still rife in the Human World of today
Racism through religion and nationality and culture and race
Is now as was always a human disgrace
All children are innocent and free of sin
Yet many are disadvantaged by colour of skin
Racists in their ways are so very small
Too big for their thinking the beauty of a fair go for all,
Racists have poor sense of self image and low self esteem
Yet many non racist people in the World it does seem
Many people to the higher self remain true
And their dream of a fairer and more enlightened World they pursue
For racism through religion and culture and nationality and race
In the Human World there should not be a place.
