Note:  Bruce Lee (27 November 1940 -  20 July 1973)   was a Chinese American and Hong Kong actor, and founder of the Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist)   martial arts movement. He is highly-regarded and most-loved by his movie fans and martial art followers, viewed by many martial art commentators as 'inarguably' the greatest martial arts star of his generation.
