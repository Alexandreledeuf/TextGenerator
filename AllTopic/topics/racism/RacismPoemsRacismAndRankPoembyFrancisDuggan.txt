Racism and Rank are humanity's shame
All people should be equal and the same
But in my lifetime this will never be
In the Human World of inequality
The person born into a so called royal family
Should be no more equal than the likes of you and me
But human society is not structured in this way
And such is life as some are known to say
The facts tell us so and facts do never lie
That human beings are mortals and all born to die
The billionaire like the pauper to the Reaper's scythe must fall
Eventually death comes to one and all
In the Human World inequality of Rank and Race
Seems sad to say will always have a place.
