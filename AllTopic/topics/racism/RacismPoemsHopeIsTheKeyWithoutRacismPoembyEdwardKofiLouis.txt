Globe,
Lobe,
Robe! ! ! !
Rope of life,
Hope is the key without racism!
Dreams of love and life,
Doing the right thing;
Accepting all mankind without racism.
Crest of love,
Nest of peace,
Eyes to overcome the odds of life;
Burst! ! !
Not with lust,
Only with the truth.
Adventures!
Sailing along with your mind,
Able to share and care;
Musing along like a beautiful flower,
Enhancing the truth,
Movingon! !
Watching the birds singing along;
A lovely song.
Motherland with the beauty of nature,
Steps taken with love;
Hope is the key!
Dreams of righteous morals;
Works and words,
Uplifting the muse of the truth.
