We the black people,
The workin folk
Bus drivers, waiters, garbage men
The common peeps dat
The millionaires and billionaires
Regard as a pathic joke
Our lives to them
A pig in a poke
When we cry foul
They act as if
Nobody speaks,
This planned but never implemented
Democratic process reeks
Our so called government
IS Full of pie-backed, two faced
Money hungry anglo freaks
With new world order
Tattooed on their cheeks
Cause most of us
Have took a toke
Of weed or alcohol or coke
Got high…
And are victims of the
Propaganda laced media…..
In a stupor we ask why…
Why do they lie…?
To the poor and disenfranchised
That still clings to the concept
Of baseball and apple pie
Of God and country
Semper fi…
We the black people
Hope
That all these racist
Elitist…
No count hawk
Right wing defeatists’ crakahs
Die…
We the black people
Pray
That all these nazi, .. Skin head
Turner diary believing
Devil worship,
War is money
Death is honey
Twisted honkeys, ... fry, .. TODAY…Listen to what I say
