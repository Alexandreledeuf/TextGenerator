Racism
Of my eyes two stream
I had read
Read somewhere
Where was that?
Do not know.
Hollywood’s classic’s nice ending made me laugh
But I felt pain of Dave and Philip, who is me?
What is race?
What the hell when with faith?
I hate it but exist.
Unlucky
I could be for having been around.
Seeing rich, poor in pain and others,
Ate their food, in kitchen I slept with the rats, guinea pigs.
I have walked in their shoes.
I cried with the film.
Out of eyes two streams.
What is race?
What the hell when it comes with the faith?
Jews-Arabs or Persians and blacks, first nations…all hated.
I’m tired of myself,
Of being,
Of walking on two feet,
Walking as a mankind,
I’m ashamed, I’m ashamed.
Read the book,
Watch the film:
Gentleman’s Agreement,
Then cry as I did.
Feel ashamed of being human.
