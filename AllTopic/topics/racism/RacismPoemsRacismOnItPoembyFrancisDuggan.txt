Racism on it does not have gender or colour or creed
And the Human World of it is surely not in need
The greatness in 'the fair go' the racist seems to miss
There is truth in the saying that ignorance is bliss
Racism does not have a nationality it is not black, white or brown
And racists live in the countryside and every village and city and town
No shortage of racists in the Human World of today
Yet they are in minority that would seem fair to say
The majority I know of not racist in any way
To those different to them due respect they do pay
In the Human World it does not have any use
And for racism there never is an excuse
The racists as people in their ways are small
Long live the greatness in 'a fair go for all'.
