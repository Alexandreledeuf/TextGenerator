Racism
It is bad
It is bad
In the deep south.
In the deep south.
I was a little girl
Growing up
Trying to find my way
Suffering always at the hands of
Damn morphodites
But I could see that my dear old indigenous maid
Had it worse off than me
Because of racism
Oh woe is racism
I just want to be me
