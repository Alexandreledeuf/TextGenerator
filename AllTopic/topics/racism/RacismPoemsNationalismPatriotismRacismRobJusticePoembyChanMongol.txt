It was heart breaking to leave great grandfathers area;
Blood sucking land grabbers and from their phobia!
Loved those trees, fields, own homestead with fence;
From their disturbance I couldn't have any defense!
Homestead and land were taken unlawfully by them;
Rules of hyenas can'tsafeguard us in their system!
Life is running extremely fast;
Towards ash to ash, dust to dust!
There is no control and no power;
No medicine and no cure are!
I laugh when you want success;
Selfish luxury whom to impress?
Many make big profits in own nationalservices;
Religions, nationalism, patriotism make their races!
Nationalism and patriotism are two bad viruses;
In courts, lawyers, police, military, students, most cases!
Why important what race, religion, nationality you have?
Only global humanity can save and can make you brave!
