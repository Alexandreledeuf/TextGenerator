People from different places come to America
They have different backgrounds and have different skin
But they are in America
They should be accepted, even if their from Berlin
And yet we make fun of how they look
And call them names by their background
Because it’s a little harder for them to read a book
And we look down on them and frown
Racism is a weird thing
Sometimes we don’t even know what it is
Like Mr. King
And that dream of his
We shouldn’t judge people
At any cost
Because their still people
Just a little lost
So the next time you see someone
Being made fun of because of their color or background
Don’t keep walking and look down
Help and try to fix what has just been done
People are people
And they have feelings too
People are people
Just like you
