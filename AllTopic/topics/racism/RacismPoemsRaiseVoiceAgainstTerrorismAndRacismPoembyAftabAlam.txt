Water is searching the path—
Lost its way—
We are dancing, laughing,
In our own way—
Gust of flood snatched happiness,
After waiting long for lost way,
Our thought is not less than water,
Searching the peace way—
Gust of unified thought- be a flood
For terrorism to wash out from earth,
How long  we let them paint earth with blood?
