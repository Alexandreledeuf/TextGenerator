Racism has no place
in poetry
dear poets
equal all you be
all words
have an imagery
yours may be
could be
Indian or Asian
others love
English orCyndy's
What?
see you don't like it
though you know it
keep out of mind
then stay also
outta mind
(of others)
compose poetry withfervor
see I return to give
SERMONS
here
so do THE POET IN ME
hear
