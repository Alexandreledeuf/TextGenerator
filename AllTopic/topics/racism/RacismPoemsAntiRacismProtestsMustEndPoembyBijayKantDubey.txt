The matter is over,
They have erred
And for this the court is there
But why to create nuisance unnecessarily
By demonstrating and damaging,
Vandalizing it all,
Burning and charring it all?
The bystanders and passers-by have
Already reported it
With their click of the cameras,
The guilty are already under the scanner
But to hold it guilty all
Is not good at all.
The matter is sub judice,
The court is looking into the matter,
But take you not law into
The hands of yours,
The offense they have
Is serious no doubt.
But it will take,
Justice will be done
Be sure of it,
But take it for also that
Man sometimes errs too,
Does not know why is he erring?
