I am what I am and your not.
It was said by someone
that once she lets me inside
back to you she won't ever come.
When they say
what I lack in intelligence I make up in size.
When they say
what I lack in education I make up in speed.
Mr.Hampton is closed
my mind he made up long ago.
Across mirror lake
rowing twords me is a man in a covered boat
she goes to Yale.
Don't call the police on me.
I don't have an alibi.
It must of been done by that other someone
it couldn't of been done by me.
Every thirty one days rabbits can.
I don't like what you are I am not.
A monkey can see what you never could feel.
It's people like me that you need.
