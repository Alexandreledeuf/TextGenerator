A newborn babe is racist free.
Racist levels that fill one's mind
Come from others like family,
Flowing ever through humankind,
As long as stark races exist.
Seeking the minds ever to fill,
Racism will seek to persist,
Where it can flow, racism will.
Minds filled full will do racist acts,
From minds filled part way, racist speech.
Most often the racist attacks
Thought after thought, while silent each.
Either a racist is or not,
Either by deed or word or thought.
