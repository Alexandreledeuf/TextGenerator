yes I know what you mean
yes I understand how you feel
yes some events in world history...
should never be forgotten
should always be remembered
least this evil happens again...
but two wrongs do not make a right
reverse racism is still racism
bigotry prejudice intolerance injustice
racism in any form
is a crime against
culture ethnic diversity
our entire race humanity
