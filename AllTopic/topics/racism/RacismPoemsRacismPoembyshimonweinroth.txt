I'm not a racist, I just don't want, to live with them
What makes you think, they want to live with you,
See, it's them, they are bloody racists,
I wonder why, they don't want to live with me
I'm not good enough for them
It must be they want to take away my house my land,
My car my livelihood, they are not only racists
They are just damned theives, Racism is all about theft
They would rob me of my place and equal space
I'm not a racist, there are just too many of them
Next thing you know, they'll want to run the show
And tell me what to do, make laws and rules,
Sit in judgment, take a share of the cake.
Racism is an economic war, dressed in cultural bias
A crueler form, of personal nature, adding insult to injury.
