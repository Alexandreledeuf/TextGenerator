thanks for making me comfortable.
on my first day at hospital.
thanks for standing like a friend,
when i felt lone and when my hope was about end.
thanks for giving me courage,
when i felt weak and scared.
thanks for wiping my tears.
when i cried just before surgery,
as i was filled with all fears.
thanks for taking care of my life,
when i felt that i am about to die.
thanks for the help you lent,
when i was helpless like an infant.
thanks for all the cleaning and feeding,
when like a cripple i was lying.
thanks for treating me with a smile.
when i cried and even turned bile.
thanks for supporting me, when i was abate.
thanks for standing by my side, when i slept late.
thanks for all your help,
during the times when i tired to take care of myself.
thanks for making me smile again.
and making me realize the pain was not in vain..
thanks for listening, when i wanted to talk.
thanks for encouraging, when i started to walk.
i have no words.i have no ways.
just want to let you know.
i will be grateful always.
