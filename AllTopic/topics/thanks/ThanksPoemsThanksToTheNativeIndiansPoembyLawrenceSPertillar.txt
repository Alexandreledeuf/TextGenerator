Thanks to the native Indians,
Who saved those arriving in ill health
And disease.
As they traveled and arrived from the South,
To bear the blunt of the cold...
On the East Coast.
Even though history will not dare,
To reveal the truth.
Let those aware of your sacrifices...
Declare to you our thanks,
As we worship in our prayers.
With blessings to you,
On this Thanksgiving Day!
