He was not in to surface love,
Deemed it casual and for show;
But felt that deep within oneself
Was the place for love to grow.
Though he was never'born again',
In his faith he seemed secure.
His dealings with the trials of life,
Found him steady and sincere.
Work became his driving ethic;
Heavy, heavy was the load.
The path he walked along life's span,
Was a rough and and narrow road.
He faced life's problems straight-away
And he shunned hypocrisy;
He travelled the restrictive roads,
Of truth and fidelity.
So long ago he quit this life,
Leaving me alone and sad.
I try to follow on his course;
This is my thanks to you, Dad.
