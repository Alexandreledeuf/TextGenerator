Today I can finally thank you
Thanks so much for tossing my heart in a shredder
Thanks for making me feel blown off and unimportant that one last time
If you hadn't done what it is that you did
And I hadn't said those shitty things I said
Then I would probably still be holding on
With my bare soul to a farce of a fantasy
Or maybe it was a fantasy of a farce
Either way, thanks again
