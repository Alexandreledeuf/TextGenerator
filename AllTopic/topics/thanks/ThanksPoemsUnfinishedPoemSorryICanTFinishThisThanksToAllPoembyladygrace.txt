Is it the tear measures hate and love?
Is it the laughter gages one’s kindness?
Is it the fame evaluates the popularity?
Or is it the failure determines the necessity?
If there’s no end
How to determine the beginning?
If there’s no ugly
How to assess the beautiful?
If there’s no excellent
How to distinguish the fool?
If there’s no big
How can we notice small?
i will post even if this is unfinished...thnks for all...
