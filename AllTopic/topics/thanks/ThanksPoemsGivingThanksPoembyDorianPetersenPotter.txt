Giving thanks to him, because he’s God
And God is in everything, don’t you see?
God is in you and me and always will be,
It doesn’t matter when you sin or stray!
God is always in your heart and your life
And he’s the only one who knows it all.
Give thanks to him, because he’s God,
And he loves us even we all sin and fall
God is constantly watching you and me,
Everyday when you're resting or in the go,
And God answers prayers, not in your time,
But in his own time, and does what he knows
And God created all and knows everything
Give thanks, that he’s our Savior and King!
