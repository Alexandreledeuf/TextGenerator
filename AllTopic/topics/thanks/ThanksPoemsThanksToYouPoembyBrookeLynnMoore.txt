You never let me live my life my way
You say it was in my best interest
But was it really or was it just in your best interest
Guess we'll never know because we don't talk, anymore
Thanks To You
If I wanted to be a dentist that wasn't good enough
If I wanted to be a doctor it was too easy
If I wanted to be President of the United States of America
I could do better, but I didn't
Thanks To You
If I got a 'B' on my report card
That got me in trouble
So I would try harder and get and 'A'
But I still felt bad that it wasn't an 'A+'
Thanks To You
Well guess what, I rebelled
Thanks To You
My life isn't what it should be
Thanks To You
I don't dream anymore
Thanks To You
And you made it impossible for me to forget
What you did and how you treated me
And look at me now, this is all
Thanks To You
