thanks for all who commented and thanks for who inspired me,
who let it be from Top 500 poems
thanks for that sailor who left his mermaid on that island while waiting under one  tree..
thanks for who let my tears fall when harshly criticized me..
thanks for who felt me..............
what does matter is being able to reach you...to share you my
thoughts and my aching heart's beats..
