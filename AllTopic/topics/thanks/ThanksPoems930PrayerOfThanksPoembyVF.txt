Thank you dear Father for all the wonders and gifts you'v bestowed
from the fullness of your bounty, enriching my heart and soul
brilliant yellow blossoms hanging heavily and bending every bough
like your arms reaching down to me from heaven above
the riot of colors that summer dresses every lowly corner
gladdens my  heart  and fills it with deep inexplicable joy of knowing your love
I see your presence mirrored in the deep green waters of the calm lake
and feel your loving touch as the breeze gently caresses me on a hot summery day
drenched am I in your love, as I run barefoot- carefree and gay
filled with the bliss of being alive and feeling the peace you'v gifted me overflowing from my heart
thank you dear Father for giving me life.. and pain enough to love every joy
