Endless thanks God
For making my pen mighty
And thereâ€™s nothing to be afraid of
Since you are with me.
Endless thanks God
For the peace of my mind
And for the wisdom that I seek.
Endless thanks God
For the friendship between us
And for the patience I have.
Endless thanks God
For all the favors
You bestow upon me.
