For
the stillness of the morn
our joy when tiny lambs are born
gardens full of glorious fowers
I humbly thank the heavenly powers.
For
thoughts of golden days gone by
the lark ascending in the sky
babbling brooks and gentle streams
I humbly thank this land of dreams.
For
the magic hour you said 'I do'
glamorous nights all spent with you
the echo of our baby's cry
I humbly thank The Lord on High.
