thanks for being strength in my weakness
thanks for being hope in my despair
and mores, thanks for being there
when light walks away from the forest
along the long lonely snaking road
are cascading pike-peak  thorns
they hurt the foot at where none can care
all you can hear are crickets singing their dirges
when we call for ululation to heal the hurts
when the sun rises as it usually does,
and the cock crows at the hour it can;
when the apostolic minister rings the church bells
and the congregation begins to sing the 'martins',
hear it again, it's me saying once again, many thanks.
