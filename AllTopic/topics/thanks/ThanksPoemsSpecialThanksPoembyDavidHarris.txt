This is my 2000th poem,
though not all are posted here.
A lot of my early work
just failed to pass the test of time
and have been left locked away.
I always told myself that when I reached 2000
I would retire from poetry.
At least for a while.
I have other writing projects
that need my urgent attention
so I am saying a special thanks
to all those whom over the last two years
have read my poems
and left a comments here and there.
I also want to say thank you
to those who read my collaborations
with Jo Jo Bean and Meggie Gultiano
as Jo Jo Bean, Dodgy Dave and Meggie Gultiano,
and my alias Howard ‘Howie’ Johnson.
I say thank you to every one of you.
To say that I am leaving is not quit right;
I will still be reading and commenting
from time to time.
It is just that I will not be posting
for the foreseeable future.
Thank you once again for all the support
you have given me
and God Bless every one of you.
