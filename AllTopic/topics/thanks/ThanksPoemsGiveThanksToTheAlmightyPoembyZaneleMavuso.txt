I give Thanks
A moment too soon
Words Spoken too early
Undiscussed plans lead to
unprepared decisions
I live to wish, hope and dream
I plan to go further with my life
live Large and be successful
Yet GOD gives what He knows is appropriate for me
A Blessing He granted
No man may Curse
A Gift He giveth
No man may taketh away
A plan He made
No man may override.
