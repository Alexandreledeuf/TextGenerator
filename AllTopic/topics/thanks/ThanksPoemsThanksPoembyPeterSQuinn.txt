Thanks for being that kind
In my heart and mind
I'll prosper your way
To give worth something to say
I call him love
Through the open sky
For he’s above
In each of my try
So much of his given
For all to feel
What time have driven
Into the real
Thanks for bringing mountain
On to the faraway
The drips of your fountain
Shall always stay
I call him love
Through the open sky
For he’s above
In each of my try
Thanks for this striking earth
And everything free
In times own worth
And giving it to me
