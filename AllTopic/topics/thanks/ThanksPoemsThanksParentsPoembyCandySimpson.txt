The moment you’re born, your parents promise you that they will always be there.
As you grow up, and reach maturity, you’ll realize that they say words but they don’t really care.
They tell you “we’ve been there, and done it, so don’t make the same mistake because we understand.”
But they don’t really know the reason why we tear, cry, and wipe off the tears with our hands.
Parents expect you to be who they want you to be, and soon enough they don’t listen to your voice.
They make all these promises to you, and now suddenly they broke and they are giving you no choice.
Parents talk to you about freedom and speaking out your mind, but when you’re expressing yourself, they block you out.
They say “I don’t want to hear because you’re too young to understand.” when really they are the ones who don’t know what they’re talking about.
I just want you to understand my heart and love me for me.
You can’t make me into someone that I don’t want to be.
You think that you get me, but the truth is that you don’t have a clue.
You say “you don’t know what you’re talking about” but in fact, I truly do.
I just want you to be happy for me, and see how much potential I really have in life.
Sometimes you make me so unhappy and you say you’re going to be there for me, but in fact you stab me behind my back with a knife.
Parents don’t really promise you anything, but I guess we pretend that they do.
So, they can help guide us in life and maybe we can learn to make a mistake or two.
You should be proud of me instead of judging me that some of the choices I made in life were wrong.
But, I don’t regret any of my experiences that I’ve endured because they made me emotionally strong.
