I asked Allah for strenght, that I might achieve I was so week, that i might learn humbly to obey.. I asked for health, that I might I might do better things...
I asked for riches, that I might be happy I was given poverty, that I might be wise... I ask for power, that I might have the praise of men
I was given weakness, that I might feel the need me Allah..
I asked for all things, that I might enjoy life I was given life, that I might enjoy all things..
I got nothing that I asked for but everything I had hope for.
Almost despite myself, my unspoken prayers were answered.
I am among all who most richly blessed!
