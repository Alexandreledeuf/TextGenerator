MY FATHER SAID
ALONG LONG TIME AGO
HE SAID SON TAKE A GOOD LOOK AROUND
AND SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS LAND IS
AND DON'T LET ANYONE BRING IT DOWN
BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR HOME
ONCE MY HOME UNTIL I GOT ILL
BUT BEFORE I DIE
AND YOU BURY ME UNDER THIS HILL
LET ME TELL YOU A STORY
WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR A PLACE
TO CALL HOME
I WOULD WALK MILES
UNTIL I FOUND A SPOT TO DIG
AND I WAS GONNA BUILD IT
ON MY OWN
BUILD IT ON THIS GREAT LAND
AND I WILL BUILD IT
WITH THESE HANDS
AND WHEN I'M DONE
GONNA HANG THE FLAG SO HIGH
SO ALL COULD SEE
WHO EVER MIGHT COME
LET FREEDOM STILLS LIVES
THE WAY OUR FOUNDING FATHERS
WANTING IT TO BE
AND STILL TILL THIS DAY
WE ARE STILL FREE
THANKS TO THE MAN
AND WOMEN
WHO FOUGHT AND GAVE UP THERE LIVES
FOR US TO STAY FREE
THE WAY OUR FOUNDING FATHERS
WANTING IT TO BE
SO SON BE PROUD OF YOUR HOME
BUT MOST OF ALL YOUR FREEDOM
