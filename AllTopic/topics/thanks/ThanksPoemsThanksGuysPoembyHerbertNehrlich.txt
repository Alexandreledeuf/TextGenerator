In search of crime and criminals
I muster my subliminals.
Write poems, simply, on the run
and wish I had a loaded gun.
Since time is really of the essence
I can't attend those forum lessons.
To those of you who wrote opinions
about my poems, and the minions
who love the daylight out of me
I do accept all flattery!
Yet time is short, thus please excuse
my seeming lazy and obtuse
neglect of those who took the time
it is not meant to be a crime.
I thank you all, please read some more
the stuff I send from distant shore.
