I am free
from all the things I have done to me
I am free to fly
to spread my wings and soar the skies
I feel my heart has come to life
I feel as if I must be high
for I have never felt this way
what is this thing that liberates?
Success......
is the answer.
I thanks Allah for all he has done to me,
thanks  for giving me my moon....
