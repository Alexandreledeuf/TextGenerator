Her coat shone silky smooth that afternoon.
Her tail wagged like a metronome.
She raced the local kids around the oval.
They laughed and called her 'sausage dog'.
That night she stumbled on the stairs.
She whimpered when I tried to pick her up.
By midnight she was shivering with shock.
The vet suspected herniated discs.
Next day - incontinence and paraplegia.
The suited specialist duly kept us waiting.
Offered surgery (without a guarantee) .
Two thousand dollars?  You must be joking!
The breeder said 'Give old George a ring.
He'll soon have her on her feet again.
He treats them in an open fronted shed.
Calls himself a canine chiropractor.'
George Schofield - nearly eighty five years old -
A nugget of a man with heart of gold,
Placed his stumpy hands upon her spine.
In seven days, my little dog was fine.
This happened four years ago.  As far as I am aware, Old George is still manipulating dogs from all over Victoria.  He works every day from 10.00am till 4.00pm.  He has Tuesday's off.  He must be pushing 90 by now.  I'll never forget him.
