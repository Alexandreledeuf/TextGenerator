Thank You, Lord, for simple things
That money just can’t buy:
Love, health, happiness
And the beauty of the sky.
Family, friends and gentle pets
Are blessings in disguise;
A mother who is wonderful,
A father who is wise.
Thank You for the basics:
Food, clothes, a home.
Also for the things unique
Like waves with white foam.
It’s not always the big things—
The noble and elite—
But at times, the simple things
That make life complete.
