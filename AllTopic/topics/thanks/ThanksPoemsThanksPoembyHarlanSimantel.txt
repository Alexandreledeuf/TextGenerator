Thanks for your fresh Spirit
You supply each day
Thanks for guidance
Along the way.
Thanks for birds
And the music they sing,
Thanks for dogs
And the affection they bring.
Thanks for cats, big and small -
I'm amazed at how
You created them all.
Thanks for the sky,
Blue or cloudy,
Thanks for storms
When nature gets rowdy!
Thanks for sex
It feels so good,
Thanks for renewing
A good attitude.
Thanks for friends
In heaven and earth
They're priceless -
That's what they're worth.
Thanks for skill
You gladly endow,
Thanks for inspiring
And showing me how.
I'll keep this short,
And right to the point,
Thanks for keeping
My nose out of joint!
