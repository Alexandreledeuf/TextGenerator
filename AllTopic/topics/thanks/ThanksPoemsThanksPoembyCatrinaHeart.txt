My thankfulness for the sacred text
you have engraved on my obelisk
The hieroglyphics carved means so much
In my journey to the seven seas
You stood to be my beacon on the storm
You stood as a tree seeing my history
Thanks once again for the friendship
Painting my days really worth remembering
