when you are sad and weary,
and nothing give you peace,
just close your eyes,
and think of Him,
your worries will surely cease.
when you are tense and worried,
and think constantly bout the future
He who put you in this world,
will surely nourish and nurture.
when all seems to be going wrong
and youve lost the will to fight,
just lay yourself at his feet
and watch things become slowly right.
He's there for you in hard times,
but forget him not in good,
its He who gave you, all that you have
invisibly by your side He stood.
we look for Him everywhere,
when he's within us all the while,
you only have to ask an inch,
and He willingly gives a mile.
His love for you is boundless,
hes a friend for one and all,
when youve looked for happiness everywhere else
its time to heed His call.
wordly pleasures are momentary,
lasting joy is through His door,
just search within yourself, dear friend
He's right within your core.
Have faith, have hope
and do your best,
a good life will be your reward,
whatever you do, just remember
don't fail to say thanks to your God.
