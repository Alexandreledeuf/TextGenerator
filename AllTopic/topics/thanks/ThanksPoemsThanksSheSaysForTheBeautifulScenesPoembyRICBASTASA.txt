the castles of salzburg
the prairies of prussia
the tundras of russia
the rivers of Arno ang the Volga
the towers of France and America
the snow in Dubai and the islands miniaturized
in his world
all these beautiful places
she says, she had been there
except the place
in his heart. She is so sorry.
She has not seen
love there.
