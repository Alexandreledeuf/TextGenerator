-  * THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES * -
You used to send me little things
that brightened up my day.
You'd send a joke or poem
that you'd found along the way.
Or you'd send a little message
that you'd written just for me.
How I miss that little kindness,
that I no longer see.
But you, I'll ere remember
until my days are done
Because in my mind you'll always be
My friend-you're number one.
Thanks for the memories......
