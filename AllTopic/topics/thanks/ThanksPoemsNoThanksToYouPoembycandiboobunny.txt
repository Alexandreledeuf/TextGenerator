You make me want to give up
you make me want to stop trying
You say you dont care
so why are you still here?
No thanks to you im better now
No thanks to you im stronger
No thaanks to you i laugh harder
You thought you could control me
well you had to think twice
You thought i would break without you
But really im fine
No thanks to you.......
