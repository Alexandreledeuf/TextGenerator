Thanks for telling me, you are not what you are..! ! And thanks for not telling, that,
you have got two faces...! !
Now, please do tell me one thing,
which was the face that I loved,
and which one I talked with...? ?
Because, unfortunately I havent seen you...! !
Thanks for stabbing me on my back when I hugged you...! !
At least my heart wasn't hurt...! !
and now do me one more favour...
please let me know,
which was the face I loved and which one I talked with,
because,
perhaps fortunately,
till now, I havent seen you..! !
And all I want is to see you before I take my last breath..! !
Before that, thank you for every dropp of tears
my eyes carry and every dropp of blood that trickles down my back.. thank you for everything! !
