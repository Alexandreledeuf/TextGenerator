Ruthlessly the judgement was pronounced
A shameful death sentence
To be carried out at the place of a skull
For all to see and mock him
Despite his innocence, clearly proved beyond all doubt
Despite his goodness to all and sundry
Despite his love to everyone
This judgement was upheld by all
But with joy in his heart he embraced his death
So that the will of he, who sent him, may be fulfilled
So that all, including his execusioners, will be reconcilled to the creator
So that no soul will be lost
This is a sacrifice that is beyond all sacrifice
A sacrifice of life which was exceptional
Lord Jesus Christ, Thanks For Your Sacrifice
