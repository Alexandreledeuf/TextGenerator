Thanks to you
I can no longer open up and let my guard down
Thanks to you
I wonderif the next man I meet will be online fooling around
Thanks to you
I question if he will also be looking for the next best thing
Thanks to you
I have no hope in what tomorrow could bring
Thanks to you
I trust no one
Thanks to you
My days are no longer fun
Thanks to you
My tears still fall like rain
Thanks to you
Everyday my heart is in pain
Thanks to you
I obsess about what is so unloveable about me
Thanks to you
I am a prisoner to my oun obsessive thought and you hold the key
Thanks to you
I have picked myslf apart
Thanks to you
I dissected every piece of my heart
Thanks to you
I now reside in an emotional tomb
Thanks to you
Within my heart love will no longer bloom
Thanks to you
