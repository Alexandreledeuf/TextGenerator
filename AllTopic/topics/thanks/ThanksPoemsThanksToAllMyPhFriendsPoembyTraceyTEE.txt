I feel impelled to say a big 'THANK YOU '
to all my PH friends...
Who've inspired me to continue
to write, through to  the bitter end....
Though simple be my poetry,
complexities adrift, , , ,
I am thrilled my words of
heartfelt emotions
are  giving you a lift...
SO once again to one and all
your comments make my plight
a pleasure to continue
with my inspired need to write...
Lovey dovey mush at times
not everyones cup of tea...
but inbetween I aim to suprise
just you wait and see...
There's a lot more to my
hidden talents..
I keep bottle up inside...
No longer does this Lady
feel the need to hide......
................................... ...............................................
THANKS  to you all on POEMHUNTER
I can't believe I started off with one Poem
and now have over 70...
where did they all come from? ? ?
I suprise myself at times....
