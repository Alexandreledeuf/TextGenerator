What i told you
i told in
confidence
never to be told
again
expecially not to the person it was
about
You agreed with me
then you go and tell her
what i said
make her mad at me
You got mad
at me
the last time
i decided i
could not
trust
you
we had our first big fight
I dont know if i can handle
the fact that
you betrayed
me
once more
You hated her too
Now?
I am the bad guy,
destined to be
that
forever
i wish i could trust you,
but i doubt i can
gee..
Thanks
'best friend'
