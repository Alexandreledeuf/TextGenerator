Thanks for all your appreciation
I value it alot
Normally no-one cares
And they all just call me a swat
Thanks for all your appreciation
It's boosted my confidence
Poems are my passion
And stop me putting up a fence
Thanks for all your appreciation
You helped me see sense
Thank you so much
Because most people are against
Thanks for your appreciation
You're the only ones who care
I now beleive in myself
I really do, I swear
Thanks for your appreciation
It really is appreciated
And once again
Thanks to you all
For being so updated
