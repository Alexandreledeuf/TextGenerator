Thanks for calling
You're a gem
That is why
I said 'je'taime'
Voice of reason
Voice of calm
Voice that acts like
Chaos balm
Landing strip for
All my 'stuff'
Still wondering when
You'll say 'enough! '
Never seem to
Lose your cool
Even when I'm
Such a fool
Let me throw
Myself at you
Take Liberties
Without your cue
And when my mind
Flies with the wind
You have your glove out
Trusted friend
