There is no way I’d like to be
somebody else: I quite like me.
I’ll never be a household name
but I am happy just the same.
Content to be ordinary
by no means a celebrity.
I have no wish to seek great fame
to me that is a foolish game.
I know my limits and accept.
I have no reason to expect,
that Lady Luck will smile on me
There is no reason I can see.
Why she should, although she could
or so I’ve always understood
The lady’s known for her caprice.
Although she does not always please
the person who she singles out.
Although entertains no doubt
I only hope she won’t choose me
I’m happy to be ordinary.
