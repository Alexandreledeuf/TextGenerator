I don't know how you do it,
your calm tone and your different views.
No matter what's happening you make me think I can do it.
These past few weeks have been hell on earth,
I needed you and you were there.
Every time I needed your help,
you were there for me.
Every time I needed a favor,
you did it without thinking twice.
Every time I need advice,
you gave me wisdom I never could have thought of.
Whenever I was down,
you cracked a joke and made me smile.
Whenever I felt totally confused,
you lit my way.
You were the ray of light through the dark,
the feeling of joy in the sorrow,
you were my lifeboat after the wreckage,
you gave me hope even in the bleakest of times.
Look what I'm trying to say,
Is thanks for everything.
I really can't describe it,
it's nice to have someone truly care.
If you ever need help, you know where I am.
If you ever need a favor, I'll be there.
Friends till the end, and I mean every word.
Friends till the end of time, partners through anything.
Through thick and thin, happy and sad,
Best Friends never say die.
