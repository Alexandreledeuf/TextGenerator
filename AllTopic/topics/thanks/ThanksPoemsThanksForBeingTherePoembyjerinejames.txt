THANKS FOR BEING THERE
Thanks for being, you,
Thanks for giving me the joys and smiles from day one,
Thanks for helping me enjoy the atmosphere here.
Thanks for correcting me when I was wrong,
Thanks for helping me follow the guidelines  to survive,
Thanks for  helping me try and cope with people around,
Thanks  for giving me the courage to stand up on my own.
Thanks for all the advices,
Thanks for lending me your ears when I was upset,
Thanks for teaching me ways to hold on to the end,
Thanks for the love and care you showed.
Thanks for the wishes you have for me,
Thanks for the prayers you pray for me daily,
Thanks for the candles that you lit for me,
Thanks for the appreciation,
Thanks for not keeping a fence between,
Thanks for the confidence you have in me,
I will miss you and all the funny things you ever did,
The little naughty things youever said,
I wish you the very best  for you future endevour,
Thanks once again for everything.
With lots of love and prayers
