I remember a time filled
with bliss
A time that I will
always miss
We were together, just you
and me
That time has
quickly passed
I thought our friendship would
always last
Now I'm trapped and falling to
my doom
I can see my godforsaken end,
I can see it loom
I need you
here
I need you to brush away
my every tear
And now I realize, I'm falling
for you
Even I can't believe that
it's true
So save me now before
I die
Save me, before I heave
my last sigh
