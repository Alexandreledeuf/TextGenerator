Thank you, Lord, that I awoke
to see the rising sun
I pray the deeds I so today
Will merit thy well done.
Thank you for the singing
of the songsters in the trees,
and for the dewey fragrance
borne on the morning breeze.
Thank you for my loved ones
So precious, Lord to me
Guide their footsteps father
and keep them close to thee!
Thanks for life eternal
That Jesus came to give
For who so ever walks with him.
shall forever with him live.
Thanks for all thy blessings
bestowed as we walk daily on
keep us safe through out the night
to be awakened at the dawn.
