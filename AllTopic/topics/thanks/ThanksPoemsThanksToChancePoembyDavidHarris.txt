I started out long ago
with a handful of dreams,
but through the years,
every one of them vanished
or so it seemed to me.
They say that chance
plays a big part in our lives,
and it was by chance
someone recognised me
from an old photograph
Now my dreams have returned
and slowly each are coming true.
Just as I turned away
from the road a head,
I have turned back to greater things.
Once I abandoned my life,
felt it was going nowhere.
Thanks to chance
I have found myself again
and a brighter future somewhere.
