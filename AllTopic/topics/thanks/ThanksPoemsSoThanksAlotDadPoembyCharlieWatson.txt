Hey Dad look at me now,
Look at how i've grown.
Opps I forgot your not around,
I guess thats why i'm always feeling down.
So thanks alot dad.
I can't believe you left mom and i,
I wonder when you left if momm ever cried.
So thanks alot dad.
Momma said you were always alot of fun,
Dad, would you have stayed if momma had a son?
So basicly I hate you dad
The only thing you left me with was a stupid yellow rabbit.
So thanks alot dad,
I hope i can see you again,
So I can slap you in the face,
So you'll know that twelve years with out you,
Felt like a turtle race.
So thanks alot dad.
