Thanks for being there
Always being so aware
Thanks for being near when I needed you here
Thanks for staying so close when I needed you the most
Thanks for the love your rain on me like a dove
Always seeming as if you are from right above
Thanks for the times you seem to help me enjoy love
Thanks for being here when I need someone near
Thanks for being there
Also for being so fair
Thanks for saying hi
When they all shouted good-bye
Thanks for giving me the time of day
When all your friends didnâ€™t bother to say hey
