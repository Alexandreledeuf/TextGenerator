I am sorry!
Sorry, is sometimes 'Countless'.
like the waves swipe and step on my feet
like the rain washes and dip down my body and
like the stars smile and fall on my head
''Thank you''
Thanks, is sometimes 'Worthless'.
as an impeached King.
as a gangrenous lips of a Lover.
as a sapphire in the mouth of a snake.
as an elixir in the hands of Lucifer.
as salt in honey and
as sugar in fish curry.
But I'll not say,
'''countless Thanks and a worthless sorry''
