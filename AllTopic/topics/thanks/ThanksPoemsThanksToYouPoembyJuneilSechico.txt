Your pensive pen that is filled with honeyed thoughts,
Inks in my bossom with nectarous qoute;
Your marmalade of love flavors my heart;
Your luscious words blossom in my ardour's pot.
Your scarlet rose of cordiality,
Perfumes ev'ry morning of my day;
Heaven-scented juice from sapphire sky,
Showers my soul, blazes my very eyes,
Ev'ry time you wave your sweetest hi.
Your verdant pasture of solicitude,
Kissed by the xanthous sun of beatitude;
Emblazons my sight with ardency,
To see the pinnacle of heyday,
With a rainbow of celestial bliss,
Flamboyantly drawn on welkin's face.
Your candied grin of encouragement,
Became my character's ornament,
With blithesome colors from the firmanent,
Of burning tons of inspiration,
Fuels me to reach my aspirations,
Intensifies my motivation,
To touch the countenance of my ambition.
Thank you for the beauteous things you've taught,
For the barrels of sweetness you've brought;
Made me ready to face the world,
Fearless, confident, positive and bold,
To do the things they think I can't do,
To cease them from throwing their flaks of boo.
What I am now, I owe to you;
With all my heart, I thank you...
