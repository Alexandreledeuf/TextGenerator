You know how when there’s a disaster where a bunch of
people are killed and the one guy who survives thanks God?
I think that’s a pretty screwed up perspective on the situation.
I know he’s happy to be alive, but if anything, he should be
cursing God for letting everyone else perish.
Now, why did God save this one guy’s sorry ass? Because the
guy went to church and prayed? I’m sure some of those folks
who perished did that too.
I know what you’re going to say – that it’s all part of God’s
mysterious plan. What an ignorant explanation that is!
And it’s not even an explanation.
I suppose Hitler was part of God’s plan too? And what about
Michael Bolton? Was it God’s plan to make that talentless hack
a superstar? Now that I think of it, maybe it was God himself
who went out and bought up all those CDs in order to
artificially run Bolton up the charts. If that’s the case, then it’s
true that God has a very mysterious plan. But at least he has a
sense of humor.
