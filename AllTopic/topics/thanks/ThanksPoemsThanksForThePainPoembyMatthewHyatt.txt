Today is the day
I wanted so much to say
Thanks for the tears
Thanks for the fears
Thank you for so many lost years
Thanks for the pain
Thanks for the black and blue affection
Thanks for the debt
Thank you for all the times you lost a bet
Thank you for causing so much strife
And last but not least.....
Thank you for taking my life.
