While browsing through poemhunter.com, I stumbled upon Mr. Afzal Shauq's profile. I read his first poem and was so amazed by his writing that i sat the whole say, reading through his amazing work.
Mr. Afzal Shauq..words fail me to describe this great man. All the poets wreck their minds over how to write but Mr Shauq, he's different because he thinks from his heart. Mr. Shauq has achieved something that millions of people like me can only dream of. He has a vision of all the world coming together as one whole country. Mr. Shauq wants the world to live as one. Mr. Shauq preaches in humanity and brotherhood.
According to Mr. Shauq the best weapon to fight a war is 'A Friendly Smile.' Isn't that a brilliant idea? We all dream of world peace and wish for wars to end. But that's about it, we don't do anything beyond that. The difference between Mr. Shauq and us is that he not only dreams of world peace but work's towards making the dream come true. And the best part is Mr. Shauq is not only making his dream come true but ours as well. He has the power to do it through his writing. He has something alot more than talent and what's amazing is that he uses his talent to promote world peace, something that's most important in today's world.
From his unique collection of poem's, inspite of me loving his each poem; there were a few that captured my heart the most. The poem‘ Global Peace Theory’ is one of them…
'Global Peace Theory' / Afzal Shauq
If and when the invincible book of norms is ignored?
If and when custom of humanity is burnt to dust?
Due to the wicked shadows of greed, lust and other evil doings,
We don’t have the right to be named as human beings.
Rather, we are brutal animals like vultures and crocodiles.
If we truly wish from the heart to be called humans of higher race,
Then we must not shrink when we are called “the children of Adam”.
For once we begin to consider ourselves as sons of Adam
Of this verdant mound, of this dry land, of this circling life –
Then we might also try to answer the ancient golden query of………
“Aren’t we cousins to each other? ” or “Aren’t we all brothers and sisters? ”
Hence, let’s all take initiatives to bridge up the gaps between hearts.
To connect all broken knots regardless of color, creed or race,
Via road to positivity, presenting cheerful aura of glowing smiles.
Respect to one another is a blooming string that ties warm cozy ends.
Letting social life be dance and sing melodiously with the collective actions.
Pleasing, filling, satisfying; the glaring shadows of humanity.
In which it has long been betrayed, jumped out of shell,
By the selfish wand and magnetic resonance of greed!

In the poem ‘Global Peace Theory’ Mr Shauq has sent out a rather meaningful message. In this poem Mr. Shauq is stressing on the way we human's behave. T he humanity is fading away every second. Human beings are given the power of understanding. But sadly they misuse it by plotting against each other. If so then do we have the right to call ourselves human beings of higher race? Mr. Shauq further quotes that let us all cross the boundaries of one's color, race, religion and country and let us all become a single united nation, filling our hears with nothing but peace
.
'A New Dawn' is yet another example of his amazing talent. Through this poem Mr. Shauq gives hope to millions of people around the world promising them a new dawn, making people's belief stronger
.
