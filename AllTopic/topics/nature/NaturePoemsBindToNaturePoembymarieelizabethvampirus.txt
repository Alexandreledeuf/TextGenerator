it'll be you and me
up in the tree
and the forest will give us the answers
it'll be you and i
up in the sky
we'll be so high
its a combination for disaster
i'll be yours and you'll be mine
its a law i cannot define but the fire
will keep us burning for eachother
it'll be us against them
the current churnning again
as the waves bind us together
