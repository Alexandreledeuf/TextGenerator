The sounds of nature tells us many things.
The sounds of nature are our teachers.
The sounds of nature are so soothing
Yet they can be terrifying.
How can we say what nature is?
What do we really know about nature?
So many questions we have asked.
So many have gone unanswered.
So what does the sound of nature means?
We shall never know.
