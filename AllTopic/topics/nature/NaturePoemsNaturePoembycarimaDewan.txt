Creamy pink flowers blossoming off orchard trees,
Sweet smelling flowers with pollen to attract bees.
Everyday a new green leaf from a tree grows,
With such speed the water in a river flows.
Snow-covered mountains, at great heights that people climb,
Such creations are extremely hard to find
From the grains of sand to the vast deep oceans,
To produce such amazing beauty, god must have made some kind of potion.
