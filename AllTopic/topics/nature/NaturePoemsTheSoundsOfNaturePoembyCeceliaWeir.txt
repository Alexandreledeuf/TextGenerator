The Sounds Of Nature
O, tis so sweet.
Who am I
That would dare try to repeat
The lovliness of a tweet.
The flutter of its wings
The tiny cute prints
Of a little birds feet.
The Sounds of Nature
O, how beautiful yet afar.
Are raindrops against the windshield
Of a still parked car.
Each little drip dropp runs
Caressing the mind so intensely
Seemingly just to play a part
Or perhaps for the fun of it.
O, The Sounds Of Nature
Sometimes deeply doth groan.
When by an unwillingly nature
One's heart decides to roam.
How lovely is a weep
Who does understand the moan.
When its all part of nature
But who wants to be left alone.
