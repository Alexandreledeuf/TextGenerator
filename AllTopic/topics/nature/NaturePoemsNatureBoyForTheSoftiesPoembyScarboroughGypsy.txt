This bogey is a fing
What lives up in your nose
And how they comes to get there
No one really knows
Me grandad likes to blow ‘is out
And then he takes a look
I fink he’s double checking
Just how many he has took
But me see, I is different
I likes to pick ‘em out
By stickin’ up me finger
And jiggling it about
Then when I knows I got one
I quickly whips it out
But I don’t shows I got one
‘cause mum would scream and shout
So then I likes to hold it
Between me fum and finger
I roll it round into a ball
And then I lets it linger
While I finks about a place
Where I can go and stick it
But sometimes when you’re hungry
A bogey’s just the ticket
So this one, what I got right here
I fought you’d like to meet it
It’s big and grey and rubbery
And now I’m gonna eat it!
