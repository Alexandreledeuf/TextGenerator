Return, dear friend!
Please return home to Nature!
Feel the fresh mud under your feet,
Feel the cool sensation of the brown earth,
Feel the clean earth, free of all dust and dirt.
Feel and breathe the unpolluted air around you!
Re-live, my dear friend!
Re-live the splendours of Nature!
Treat the flora and fauna with tenderness,
Touch the petals and leaves with gentleness,
Tune in with nature with love abundance,
Turn to nature to get rid of all your pretentiousness!
Re-unite, my dear friend and comrade!
Return home to the arms of Mother Nature!
