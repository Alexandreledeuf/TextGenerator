Let us go gentle with the nature
It has given us many
Blessings to be proud of
Learn your Botany, Anatomy,
Geography, Astronomy, etc…
Before it is too late
Regardless of what the nature
Is giving us
A non-wise person will always
Fail to see the good side of it
He or She will only see curse
But let the rest of us go gentle with the nature…
