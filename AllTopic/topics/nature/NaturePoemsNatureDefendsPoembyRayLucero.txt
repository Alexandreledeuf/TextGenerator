Disasters aplenty, run-rampant today
Why? You may ask with look of dismay
What causes natural disasters you naively inquire
Mother earth fights for herself with water and fire
Defending with great winds and terrible quakes
Polar icecaps melting and pandemic outbreaks
She’s taken mankind’s abuse for hundreds of years
Exploited by amoral and depraved profiteers
She’s had more than enough, her patience grew thin
The wicked against her fight a war they won’t win
“I will burn them, flood them and shake them to bits”
Till the will of mankind bends and submits”
Mother Earth, made perfect by Gods Loving Hands
Created azure skies, blue waters, bountiful lands
Seeding water, land with life great and small
Providing bounteous food for one and for all
Why has mankind taken more than his God-Given share
Despoiled Earth Mother’s water, soil and polluted her air
The answer’s complex, not easy to voice
Only one word comes close, that word is “choice”
Poor choices, judgment in what mankind has done
Defiling their home with cruel aberration
So what must man do to set things right
He must love Mother Earth, stop causing such blight
Banish internal darkness, take in God’s Light
Reclaim his saneness, clear his eyesight
Restore duty-bound stewardship, regain command
Of oceans, skies and all expanses of land
No alternatives exist to these actions, as time has run out
Of this...
Earth Mother is certain with no exception or doubt
