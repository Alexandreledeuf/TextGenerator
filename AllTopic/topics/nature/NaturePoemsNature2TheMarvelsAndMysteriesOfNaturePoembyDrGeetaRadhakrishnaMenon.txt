Open your eyes to the mysteries of nature,
Open your mind to the marvels of plants and animals!
They thrive everywhere!
They adapt themselves
To the climatic changes,
Whether in land or in water,
Whether drought or flood,
Whether scorching heat or freezing cold!
There is no higher authority that they can complain to,
There is no person on whom they can put the blame on,
They only make an effort to live,
They only strive to survive!
Learn from the plants the power of endurance,
Learn from the animals to survive with tolerance!
