Why challenge Mother Nature, man, in vain?
Accept her superiority and pow’r;
One can’t traverse with equal speed each lane;
Take blame for every flood, wind, drought and show’r!
When hot, the excess steam must be let off;
When cold, one needs to cover to gain heat;
When Nature’s in a furious mood, don’t scoff;
Find solutions better and don’t retreat.
When Nature sends a breeze, man loves her touch;
When Nature blows a wind fierce, men rant, rave;
Yet, Nature balances her acts so much;
From natural disasters, man ought to save.
Align with Nature: Love the way she works;
But cursing God brings man more Nature’s jerks!
