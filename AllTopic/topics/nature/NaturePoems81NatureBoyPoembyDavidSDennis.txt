A busker on a unicycle
Dances with the birds
As teaming hordes of grey brained apes
Wend their way to work
He juggles socks to their delight
N couldn’t give a rats
If the price of oil is up or down
Or the wheat board has collapsed
And every now and then
I feel I’d like to be that fool
To bare my soul to nature
While the pigeons burble “cool”
