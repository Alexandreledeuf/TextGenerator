Autumn leaves that turn to gold
Flowers that are bright and bold
Tremble in the cooling wind
Messages the autumn sends
Soon the winter storm so strong
We hope that it would not stay long
Now it's almost time to change
And the landscape soon will rearrange
Spring will come before we know
This will bring a winter thaw
And then spring, oh glorious spring
Isn't it exciting what nature brings?
