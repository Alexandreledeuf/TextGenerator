Nature is beautiful
Nature is enticing
Nature is fun and exciting
We can only love it's
wonderful diversity
stunning imagery and
panoramic scenery
Nature is god's gift
which we must cherish and protect
But in the name of development
We demolish and destroy it
Nature is tolerant
upto a point
beyond which nature retaliates
with floods, hurricanes and tsunamis
If we can't live in harmony with nature
We will perish for sure.
