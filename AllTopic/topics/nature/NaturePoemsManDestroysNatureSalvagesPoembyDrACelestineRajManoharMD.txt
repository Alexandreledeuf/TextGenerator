How Nature creates life thats dear with ease?
How Nature sifts, selects, protects the best?
Yet, man creates, sometimes with new disease;
In ways, unheard of, costly, but with zest.
Yet, man destroys the human lives with ease;
And Nature too gets maimed beyond salvage;
Destruction too is done for mega fees;
Thus, Man lives in an earth, he turned his cage!
Who gave man rights to destroy his own race?
Who gave him this freedom to procreate?
And man has given earth a bizzare face;
Most sufferings, man-made will ne'er abate.
When will man know that life is good, precious?
When will man learn his ways are bad, vicious?
