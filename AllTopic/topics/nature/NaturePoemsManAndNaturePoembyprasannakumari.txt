As I walked along the path
Crushing grass under with wrath
That wanted to whisper sounds
Left unsaid beyond bounds
As I rested under the tree
One blue leaf fell on me
That wanted to conspire with light
Planning future far in sight
As I passed a well-known tree
One blue and blushing smile on me
That  brought me back my youth
And sure, well did it soothe
As I passed the mountain still
Stopping wind to play on hill
Flirting flower and dancing deer
Lulling leaves all keep me near
As the brooding breeze did wink
And the fading sun did sink
Bringing me my memory past
Dissolving the moon at last
When I left a lasting sigh
Dancing waves did keep me high
