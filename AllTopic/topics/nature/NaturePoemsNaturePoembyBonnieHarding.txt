Close your eyes and you can see
the way the world's suppose to be
Sunrise on a clear blue sky
fields of daisies, soft butterflies
Tall trees, leaves glistening with dew
streams and rivers flowing thru
Birds singing and flying high
gentle breezes with cloudless skies
Snow caps on the mountain tops
valleys of green that never stop
Ocean waves and pure white sand
animals grazing on the land
Feel the wind in your hair
smell the flowers, blooms everywhere
See the beauty, today is new
Enjoy nature-God's gift to you
