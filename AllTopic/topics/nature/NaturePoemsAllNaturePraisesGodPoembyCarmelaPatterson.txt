Captured in the Psalms are the most eloquent Praises
And to read and ponder them affords one great graces.
The Lord's is the earth, and the sea, and the sky;
His is the moon, stars, sun and clouds rolling by.
His Seasons glorify Him each in their own way.
Think of the hope in the beauty of a Spring day,
Thunderclaps and lightning of Summer at play,
Fall's russets, browns, and yellows in breezes sway,
And Winter's cold, chill, and ice, with snows that lay.
Ponder the land with rocks, hills and mountains,
Rivers, streams, and geysers spewing like fountains.
Consider the lilies, roses, shrubs and trees
Which cause one to thank God on bended knees.
Think about the creatures on the land and in the sea
And Praise God for everyone that has come to be.
Praise the Lord morning, noon and night
Sing out His Praises with all of our might.
Keep a book of prayers within easy reach;
Devour everything it is meant to teach.

For the Word of God throughout all ages
