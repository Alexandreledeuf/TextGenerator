Dark smouldering eyes
Shiver ran up my spine
Seething anger inside
His eyes looked straight into mine
Minutes stretching wide
So majestic and acquiline
Frozen to the core, my body numb
His body taut, ready to spring
If the glass had not been there, I would've succumbed
Giving me a last look, he soared up spreading his wings
