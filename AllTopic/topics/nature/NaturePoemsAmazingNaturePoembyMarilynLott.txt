The brilliant colors of the night
The soft spoken morning glow
My world can be so perfect
Thatâ€™s why I love it so
Earthy tones surround me
With pop-up flowers born
Fragrances so delicious
In the dew of early morn
The sky lights up just for me
With each newly woven style
I put everything aside
To enjoy for a little while
Nature is so amazing to me
I love it every single day
Each morning is freshly exciting
In its own unique and perfect way!
