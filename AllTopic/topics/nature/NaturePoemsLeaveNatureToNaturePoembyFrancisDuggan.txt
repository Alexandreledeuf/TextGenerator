Have you ever seen the offspring of a cross between a sheep and goat
Of the parents in the young one you can see a bit of both
With the physical appearance of a goat and sheep strange as that may appear
Born of an act of Nature and in Nature of stranger things one does hear.
And anything in Nature is never a strange thing
A cross between a starling and a myna has a pleasant song to sing
But when humans tamper with Nature 'tis there the wrong comes in
Though some with their degrees on natural science respect for their work do win.
On what happens within Nature humans should not have a say
And leave Nature to Nature she does things her own way
Some results of Nature may seem quite strange to see
But what happens within Nature happens naturally.
Humans do not tamper with Nature leave Nature to her own device
Every time we tamper with her for to pay there is some price
The mad cow disease is one example when meat and bone to cows was fed
Just one of the many bad results of humans tampering with Nature one might say enough said.
