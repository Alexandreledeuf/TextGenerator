The trees were angels this morning,
seeming to bend their variegated boughs
to bestow benediction upon my weary brow
as I walked out my front door,
and driving along the hilly, back road
I wanted to stop and merge forever
into the misty autumn landscape,
for that peace is all
I could ever hope to become.
