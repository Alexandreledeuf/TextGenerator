How many times we say or do
Something that we thought was true
And then it made us sad;
A hurtful word, a shameful look
I've done enough to write a book -
I doubt that it would sell;
We stumble on in ignorance
Until in time we find by chance
The answers that we seek,
For there are lessons to be learned
All thoughtless deeds will be returned -
It's one of nature's laws;
That's how we grow in mind and soul,
Each incarnation sets the goal.............
It's the nature of things.
