I've found a friend in nature
although nature could turn on me
if i'm out and about in a storm
and its lightning strikes me
if a tidal wave sweeps me far out to sea
or a poisonous snake takes a bite of me
if a tornado twirls me high into the sky
yes, the irony is that nature which
i find so enchanting
could one day cause my demise
