Baby, you are soft and sleek,
Wearing cotton and linen dress,
Attiring security thread, so clear,
The soil's water mark, run over,
Who make you so authoritative?
Every human falls for your eye wink,
The colors chosen to brighten you,
Every one of you worth to be adored,
When men's sweat worth your value,
Who make you so perfect?
How many master engravers work on you,
To have the perfect portrait and border,
Are you exposed to UV lights to get burnt?
After bathing, you do go for press setting,
Everyone work on you to make your mold,
The details of dots, fine lines, design and text,
Historical images on your face,
The signature at your hips,
Tight security at your birth place,
Transferred to the destinations,
In armored vehicles,
When you go on the streets,
With the siren on and blinking,
Everyone looks at you in desperation,
The children shouts, â€˜Money, Money', .
