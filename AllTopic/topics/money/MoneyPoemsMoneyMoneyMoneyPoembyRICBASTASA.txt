money makes sense
sometimes we make sense with what makes sense
money money money
makes this spin a little faster
we want to make more
and then we see what we do not want to see
gnarled conscience
whorled integrity
shrinking soul
lost self.
money money money
makes my world dimmer
makes us happy somehow
but for how long?
