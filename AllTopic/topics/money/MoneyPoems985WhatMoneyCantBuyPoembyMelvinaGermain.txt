You look good and you know it too
Why no one is as pretty as you
You bought yourself a new car,
Fancy clothes, going to the bar.
High heel shoes, elegant jewels
Ready to party, no hard rules
You think you’re full of class
Your money says it’s so
Always on the go, spending that money
Well just remember this honey
Money can’t buy you class, happiness or respect
Not knowing what you’re doing, be careful what you get.
