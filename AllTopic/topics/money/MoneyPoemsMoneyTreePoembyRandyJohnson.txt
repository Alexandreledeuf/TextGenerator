One day a man came to my house with a seed.
I decided to buy it because of my greed.
The man said it would grow into a money tree.
When I told people, they said they're glad they're not as stupid as me.
The tree didn't grow and I cussed and hollered.
That seed cost me ten thousand dollars.
People say that my brain is as small as a pig's.
But a CAT scan showed that it's not even half that big.
