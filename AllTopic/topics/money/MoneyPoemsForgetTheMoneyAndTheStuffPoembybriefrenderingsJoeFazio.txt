Long have I lived this life. I have finally come
to the realization, that all the gold in the world,
is not worthy, of one once of love.
Do not vanquish yourself, on the alter
of that which is materialistic or the gathering
of riches.
For in the end, there is not one among us, who
would trade all things of wealth, for yet one
more day of life.
In our final moments, it is love...or the lack of
it, that will define our moments of life and bring
to us...peace.
