A bad habit they form as a young girl or boy
To have power over others some people enjoy
With personal power some are not satisfied
Their desire for top job they don't try for to hide
They need more than personal power to be seen to succeed
It is all about money and all about greed
One might say they do have big egos to feed
The more money they have the more they seem to need
Power and money are siblings it does seem that way
And money speaks every language some are known to say
The non greedy and non power hungry people one has to admire
The lust for large sums of money or power over others they never desire
They are not the type for to put others down
Or wish to be known as the best in the town.
