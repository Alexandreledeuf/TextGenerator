Let money be thy servant, not Master;
So, put thy wealth in use for mankind's sake;
Let progress come for fellowmen, faster;
What profits come if genuine, thou may take.
The money-needs of life on earth are small;
Money begets money and vices too;
But money cannot solve our problems all;
Let  money  not cause mis- conduct in you.
What use is money kept as coins and notes?
Banks lend their money so that they may grow;
Money cannot purchase all honest votes;
For money's sake, hardships, we undergo.
How many pairs of shoes, your feet will need?
Let excess money try to others feed.
