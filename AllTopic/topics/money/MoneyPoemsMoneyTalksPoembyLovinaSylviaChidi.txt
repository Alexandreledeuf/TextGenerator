Money talks
Put it to work
Watch your world spin & rock
Money talks
But when it fucks with you
Money sucks
Without money, we are in poverty
With money, you are my property
If you are very ugly, don’t worry
There is expensive plastic surgery
If you are one who is totally boring
Spend, spend, spend and stop worrying
Who says money can't buy you love
Who says money can't buy you friends
Who says money can't buy you fame
We all live and die the money game
Money talks
Hit the jackpot
Watch the media flock
Paparazzis, children, grown-ups
Chasing you from block to block
The previous known vagabond
People now no longer mock
You ceased being a laughing stock
Now they want a share of your buck
Ignoring money talk, is not that simple
Many have thrown away their principles
Listening to money talk
It is the master of love & hate
It is the master of a smile & a frown
It is the master of respect & disrespect
It’s the difference between a good & a bad friend
Money talks
If you listen to it
You become its slave
The only path it paves
Waits silently to crush you
With an evil gigantic wave
