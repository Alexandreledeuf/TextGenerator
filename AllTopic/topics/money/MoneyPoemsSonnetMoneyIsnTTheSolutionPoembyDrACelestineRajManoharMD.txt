What's the formula for success in life?
Hard-work- this answer, everyone agrees;
How to avoid ensuing problems, strife?
Alas! most people choose money with ease.
Money is not the problem-solver right;
Money is needed to some extent, yet;
Money in excess makes a man lose sight!
Money brings evils in its wake, I bet!
Life's challenges are something, we must face;
We cannot put the cart  before the horse!
Hard-labour and honesty are life's base;
Short-cuts to success, God will ne'er endorse.
But why do people run after money?
Like bees, you gather nectar, make honey!
