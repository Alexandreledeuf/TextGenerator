nothing comes free..here
everything is tagged
excepting life...strange
life given to us not tagged
the days and nights given
are not tagged even
even then....
day in and day out
i am all out
searching ways and means
to make my money...
i do not pay any money
for the sun and breeze
god in nature an absolute giver
praying for wealth and prosperity
praying for money...money..and more money...to god
i feel will get us not even a penny
GOD DOES NOT KNOW OUR MONEY
when you send your kid on a trip away
you will give him money to spend on the way
we were sent here without a penny
when i return as dead stock one day
worldly wise kith and kin of my
send me with a penny on my forehead
just a penny?
is that what i was worth...or
is that the way fare to hell or heaven
just a penny?
