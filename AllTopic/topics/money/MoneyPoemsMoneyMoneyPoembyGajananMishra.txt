You have money
You are hungry
You have money
You are not getting anything
You have money
You have no love
You have no fresh air
You have money
You are not getting anything
You have money
You are alone
You have money
You have no place to stay
You have money
You have mp humanity
You have no sensibility
You are nothing
You have money
And you are bankrupt
And you are not happy.
