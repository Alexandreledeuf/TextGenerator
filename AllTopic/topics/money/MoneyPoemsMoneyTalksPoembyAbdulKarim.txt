Money talk's,
Money talk's,
You know it say's it all,
You got it in your mind,
That money hast to say alot about human term's,
Every word that is explained here told me,
That money hast talked in society,
The honey of Humanity,
In the status of money,
If your'e indigent,
Many men will neglect all that you have,
Even humiliate you,
Only because they have money,
They mistreat others,
Money hast talked alot about what people do everyday,
Money is root of all not good,
Even most virus is from money,
Getting drunk talk's all about money,
Forever and ever men really love money,
We need money,
But some are very greedy for money,
Money talk's alot about fables and false spirit's.
