Could it be possible to live without money?
Why can’t man live without money in the world?
Long back I saw an African movie about this;
It is called “Gods Must Be Crazy! ”
One can get the idea to live without money!
Even today people are living life in farm houses
Far away from the civilised world of materialism
Without needing money for any purpose there!
In the forest and farm houses far away from towns
Life of the people needs no money at all it seems!
We can live without money but not without hunger!
Nature has given hunger and also all things to survive;
It is man’s own creation to live as slaves of comforts
In the world where nothing is permanent in time bound life!
