I do not believe in money
I believe not in money money funny
the misuse of money so ugly
I do not believe in money
I believe in people
the gifts of certain people
I believe in people of dreams
people of pure passion dreams
lived with intensity beautiful souls
I believe in artistic passion people
who quit patchworks creative contrasts
who gift minds eye beautiful melodies
