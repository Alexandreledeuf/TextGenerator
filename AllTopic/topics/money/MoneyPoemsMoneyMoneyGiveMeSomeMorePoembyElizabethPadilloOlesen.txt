We all crave and long for money;
the rich, the poor, the young
and old cry for money to keep and hold.
We crave to be masters of money
or end up to be moneyÂ´s slaves.
Either way, we fall into the pit
if money becomes our masters
and we end up, enslaved by money.
Money is only a gift to use and share
It cannot last for long, for like water,
it flows and evaporates.
Ask for money and work for it
but let it not be your master
to be served, but a simple resource
to use, share and give to those in need.
