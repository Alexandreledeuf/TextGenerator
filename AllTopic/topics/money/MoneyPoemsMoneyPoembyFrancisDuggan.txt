In the Human World money speaks every language some say
And all things have a price on them 'twould seem that way
And though the reaper will one day claim the lives of you and I
It costs money to live and it costs money to die.
The beautiful young woman for a partner has an old billionaire
That he is useless in bed she does not seem to care
He believes her when she tells him she loves him but for his money she lie
Since she will be very wealthy when he die.
So very restricted by their poverty
The working poor cannot take their wives out to tea
To provide for their families on a small wage they get by
But a good sort of life style they don't have to enjoy.
Lack of money may lead to a good appetite
But do not expect to live to an old age on a very poor diet
The old sugar daddy is enjoying the good life
With his twenty four years old blond good looking wife.
