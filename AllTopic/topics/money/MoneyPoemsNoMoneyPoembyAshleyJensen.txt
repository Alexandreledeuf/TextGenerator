no money to do anything with
its hard enough to get by
with out some riche kid walking by
they flant their three credit cards in your face
plus their 2005 mitibushi eclipse
yet they complain that they have no money
but yet their dad has another car for them
it all makes no sense when we people must
suffer and yet survive with little money but
the other half lives in riches
if some one is in help they will not help unless it
is there friend who actually doesnt need help
but for them who really cares
no money for us only those who can afford it but
no one notices us because we try to blend in anyway
