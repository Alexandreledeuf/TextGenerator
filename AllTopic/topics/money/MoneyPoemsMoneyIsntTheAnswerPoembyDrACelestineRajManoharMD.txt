Can money give you ample sleep at night?
Can money bring you satiety you want?
Can money soothe the heart and mind aggrieved?
Can money resurrect a person dead?
Can money cause fertility in wombs?
Can money heal the wounds of minds and hearts?
Can money make up for one’s parents’ love?
Can money work a miracle you want?
Can money cure a cancer of grade four?
Can money bring joy to a childless pair?
Can money purchase your seat in heaven?
Can money solve all problems that you face?
There are so many things money can’t do;
Your trust in God and labor, matter too.
