Stolen by poverty
Let stolen by 'antipoverty'
Might of the mint is an effigy
Endorsed in life's kinetic journey
Rags to riches coiled in coinage
Birth to death in currency-appendage
Food, clothe, shelter hike
Varied labour-men when strike
Target is money-market
Goal is money-profit
Craze is gold locket
Racing in final syndromic silt
To be is to be knowledgeable
Enough is enough satiable
Fear is to fear avarice
Beware is beware of vice, malice
And
Don't we just opine of money a demon
Don't just opine of money either a daemon
Born in this country
We to deify money, Goddess Lakshmi
Bestower of wealth and morality
