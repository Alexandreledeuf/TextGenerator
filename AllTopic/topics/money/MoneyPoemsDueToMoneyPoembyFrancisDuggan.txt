Due to money good friendships have come to an end
For money can make an enemy out of a friend
And due to money many are serving prison time
For money or lack of it leads many to serious crime
Due to money the Fifth Commandment has often been broken it does seem sad to say
That some with their lives due to money do pay
Those who say money is not important to reality not true
If you owe someone a lot of money for Court you are due
Whoever say money is not important believe their own lie
People have been bashed over money and left there to die
And people due to money feel happy to deceive
And that it does speak every language you ought to believe
Yes money out of a friend can make a foe
I am telling you something you already know.
