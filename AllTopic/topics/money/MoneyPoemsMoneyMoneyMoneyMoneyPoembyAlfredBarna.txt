I know I have the answers
I’m sure I have the cure
Immaculate cars, pretty dancers
That will thrill you right to the core
All your dreams will be fulfilled
And you’ll have friends, where you go
No matter how plain or unskilled
You will be the star of the show
It’ll take just a bit of money
Just like the sweetest drops of honey
Just a little bit of money
Money, money, money, money
You want some respect
You just like to feel revered
You want some loving aspect
You want to know that someone cared
You’ll find plenty of sycophants
Catering to your every desire
A menagerie of madness not by chance
Beckoning you ever closer to the fire
All it takes is just a bit of money
Just like the sweetest drops of honey
Just a little bit of money
Money, money, money, money
You say you want to run this world
Puppet Master, part gambler too?
All the riches you will soon unfurl
Wall Street and banker are you
You can climb this hill so much faster
By making greater the ranks of the poor
Profiting mightily from their disaster
After all what are useless eaters for?
All it takes is just a bit of money
Just like the sweetest drops of honey
Just a little bit of money
Money, money, money, money
