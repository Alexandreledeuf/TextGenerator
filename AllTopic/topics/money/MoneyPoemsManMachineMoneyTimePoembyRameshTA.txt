Matter is more important than mind or heart
In this money world that rules all mankind!
Machine does more than what man can do
And man is made a servant of machine care!
The time saved by machine work is not used
Well for the betterment of man's world but are
Used for the accumulation of more money only
And man wastes time in gambling for money!
Man has become a slave of machine and money
That make him think and plan for their development
But not for the development of mind and spirit
For which all inventions were made to save time!
Caught among machine, money and time man is mad
Now not knowing how to regain his glorious state again!
