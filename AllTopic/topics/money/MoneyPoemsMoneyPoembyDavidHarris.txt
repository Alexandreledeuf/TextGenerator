We walk down many avenues,
and along many streets,
unfortunately none are paved with gold.
We have to make our own riches,
for when we do we appreciate them more.
If we were given wealth untold,
we would not appreciate it.
Better to earn our money,
we then appreciate it more.
Money can buy many things,
with that I will agree,
but money cannot buy everything,
and those word are also true.
It cannot buy the respect,
from our fellow man,
that has to be earnt too.
It cannot buy lasting love,
as that comes once,
only in our lifetime.
Nor can it buy happiness
that can only come from within us.
Money can buy material things,
clothes and food as such.
But it can ever buy
those most precious things
that we all hold so dear.
It will never buy,
anotherâ€™s warm and loving soul,
who will be beside us,
throughout of lasting days.
