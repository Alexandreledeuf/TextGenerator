With increasing needs thoughts of money have increased
And man is left in the world to live only for money forever!
It is not possible to drink, eat and live without money here;
Money thirst for everything has made man addict of money!
Taxation, price rise and mismanagement tighten oneâ€™s belt
National financial crisis coupled with world economic woes
Due to international crude oil price hike add fuel to fire ever!
Protectionism and subsidies of advanced nations strike world.
Wars and terrorist activities worsened all to face world recession;
Gold price hike and oil price hike have created turmoil unbearable!
For want of funds everyone indulges in short cut routes to riches;
There is no chance of recovery from addiction to money anymore!
Lottery, gambling, horse race and lotto many people go for
To earn fast buck so as to satisfy money hunger some how!
Betting on boxing, wrestling, cricket, general elections go on
And indirectly many accrue black money to meet their needs!
All black monies big shots deposit in Swiss bank to use abroad
By way of making exports using under invoices for many goods!
All due to bad policies of govts. and corrupt practices everywhere
Dark acts perpetrate black economy propelled by this addiction!
