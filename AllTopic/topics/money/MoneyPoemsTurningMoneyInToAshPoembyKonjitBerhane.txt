It seems as if he was thrown out of
The bar
He ran and knelt down on the side walk
The beggar
In front of the rich man who got out of his
Mercedes car
With his rough voice he begged money
For cigar
Proudly the man threw him
Some cash
On which the beggar walked on his knees
With a rush
Got the money and ran to a shop
In a flash
Bought a cigar, lit it and started to turn it
Into ash
He inhaled deep and smiled like
A star
Not knowing, the consequence
Nicotine tar
