brings pleasure to oneself

to bring them happiness but it leaves them insane

people who have it want more

but it blinds you from the ones you should adore
it affects brain it brings stress to your state of mind, it leaves your head with a receeded hair line
it pollutes the world because money is toxicity, it causes you to over eat and it leaves you with obesity

a cancer in society a false form piety
a fake form of religion shared by the royalty with an undying loyalty

before you know it you have died.
murder, genocide, for piece of paper, it comes and goes and evaporates like a vapor

it can give a new hope if your stuck but, without it your fucked
moneys history has a beginning and a rise to fame many have died in its name
the way we grope over it we should feel ashamed
because of it my older brother is lost in its game
