Money, we seek in life to fulfil needs;
Most labour hard to gain some extra wealth;
Some even go on to do evil deeds,
And in the process, spoil their body's health.
Money evades some persons for quite long;
Some get it accidentally, by luck;
Some acquire it through a single song;
But happiness can't come to all by buck.
For, money can't give bliss for all on earth;
Money can't solve all problems in our life;
Neither can it ensure a divine berth;
Money can bring a man unwanted strife.
And yet, the human mind stays money-mad,
Forgetting Almighty God; Oh, how sad!
