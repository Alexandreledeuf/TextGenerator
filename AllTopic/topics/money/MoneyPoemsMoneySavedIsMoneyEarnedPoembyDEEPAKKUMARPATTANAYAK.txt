What is money?
They say
Money makes the world go around
And people crazy and unsound
It's nothing and everything as well
Full of wonders and full of fools
Makes all endlessly ponder and droll
Some have too much and some less
A dollar or a dime, our lives they rule
And it's true and it's true
Yet there goes a saying, that's also true
That money saved is money earned
The wisdom that carries truth and mind
It's a thing to be frugal
Being thrifty, prudent and economical
Not to be misunderstood with being parsimonious
That carries attitude miserly or ungenerous
Frugal are those
That suppresses instant gratification
Thereby making themselves efficient and wise
At the core of the principle lies
The wisdom of using less or storing what remains
And not even wasting anything less
Or else, to quote Confucius
'He who will not economize will have to agonize'
This is true for both individuals and businesses
