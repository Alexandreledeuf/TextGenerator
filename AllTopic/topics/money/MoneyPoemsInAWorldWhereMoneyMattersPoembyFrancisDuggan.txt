He is sixty his hair dyed brown and she is a natural blond of nineteen
And strolling hand in hand along the beach road every evening they are seen
His grandchildren as old as she is it is so true what they say
That money does speak every language and it has always been this way.
In a World where money matters men of money seem to rule
And with a rolls royce in his garage and an indoor heated swimming pool
She must see him as a good catch though he is years beyond his prime
And he is smitten by her beauty and he buys her a good time.
One less attractive young woman for to woo for the single young males of the town
For the fellow in his sixties she has turned all suitors down
Those who say love only matters must believe in their own lie
She has knocked back men of her own age for to be with the wealthy older guy.
To those who talk of love and passion pay no heed to what they say
For in a World where money matters the sugar daddy leads the way
To find himself a young beauty he doesn't even have to try
For in a World where money matters there's little money cannot buy.
He is sixty his hair dyed brown and he goes walking hand in hand
With a young beauty of nineteen and that's not hard to understand
For in a World where money matters he is a known millionaire
And the young males of him jealous doesn't life seem very unfair?
