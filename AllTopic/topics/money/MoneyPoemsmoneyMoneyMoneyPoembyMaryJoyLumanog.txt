Money Money Money
You're just a a thing in itself
But why is it your controlling me
Bit by bit you consume my sanity...
You're  not a king but it seems like
You're everywhere...
Money Money Money
You turn myself full of greed......
I know that your a need
But then I'm not contended..
I have more of you
but seems like its not enough.....
Money Money Money
You were just created by man
But then man spare life just for you...
Crime and addiction emerged because of you...
Rich man had enough of you...
But then there the one who had  the urge to kill
Just a thing... a money?
How it seems...
Money Money Money
Are you the one who rule our lives
Without you we intend to die?
What made you so important...?
Worship you not even God
Replacing love as our life..
But money as a thing
That can ruin our life!
