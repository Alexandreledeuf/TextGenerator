Lord help me pay my bills, that's what I said yesterday
As my pen ran out of ink and my bank balance shrank
To nothing shy of the current most recent figures for poverty
Lord help me pay my bills, that's what I said this morning
As my calculator went on the blink and my bank balance
Continued to shrink and shrink and shrink
Lord help me pay my bills, it's what I'm thinking now
Taking the cow to the market and trading it for magic beans
The truck's tires are worn thin like the financial state I'm in
And the beans that I get for the cow probably won't sprout into a stalk
Tall enough and strong enough to reach Heaven's door
Because with all my problems and yours.....
We both forgot to pray to him asking for this drought to end....
