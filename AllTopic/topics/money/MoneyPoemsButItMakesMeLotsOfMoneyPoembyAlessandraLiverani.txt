Cigarette addiction kills people
But it makes me lots of money
It ruins their health
But it makes me lots of money
They cannot breathe properly
But it makes me lots of money
Their addiction causes them misery
But it makes me lots of money
A trillion cigarette butts pollute our earth daily
But it makes me lots of money
Cigarettes cause fires which burn many people to death
But it makes me lots of money
Parents buy cigarettes when their children need to eat
But it makes me lots of money
Cigarette smoke fills our bars and nightclubs, very unpleasant
But it makes me lots of money
Dirty ashtrays are disgusting
But it makes me lots of money
Why are you allowed to promote and sell such a disgusting product?
Because I've got lots of money
(Sydney, Australia - 2003)
