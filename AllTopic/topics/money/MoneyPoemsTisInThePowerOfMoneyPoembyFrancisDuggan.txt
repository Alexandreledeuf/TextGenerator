'Tis in the power of money real fame is to be found
And money is always involved where corruption abound
And corruption and human greed to each other live nearby
And why some people are corrupt this could be the answer why
Some will tell you that money is their nearest and dearest friend
And it is because of money that many friendships are known to end
And many with lots of money seem to have a crave for more
This year they have made two million in profit next year they aim for four
The lust for paper currency to everyone does  not apply
But that money speaks every language is something that none can deny
Those with it are looked up to and those without it on are looked down
And who would wish for to be known as the pauper of the town
'Tis the lust for money that leads to corruption through greed
And those with plenty of it looked up to as those who in life succeed.
