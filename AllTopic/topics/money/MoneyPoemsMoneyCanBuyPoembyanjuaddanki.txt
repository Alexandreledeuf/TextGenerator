Money can buy a house,
But not a home.
Money can buy a pen,
Not a writing.
Money can buy a book,
But not knowledge.
Money can buy a fan
But not wind.
Money can buy  a bed,
But not sleep.
Money can buy an equipment,
But not a skill.
Money can buy food,
But not appetite.
Money can buy luxuries,
But not culture.
Money can buy amusement,
But not happiness.l
