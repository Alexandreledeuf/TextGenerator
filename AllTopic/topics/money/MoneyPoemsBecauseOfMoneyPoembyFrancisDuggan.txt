Because of money people wish on others harm or ill
And because of money people others do injure or kill
And because of money great friendships have come to an end
And money can make you an enemy or make you a friend
To those with the power of money respect we do pay
And money speaks every language some are known to say
And those with the most money great power do command
That is something that is not hard to understand
Those with heaps of money enjoy the good life
The millionaire in his seventies has a twenty two year old wife
With brown hair to her shoulders and lovely to behold
She would not be with him if he were poor and old
But because of his money with him she will stay
Money speaks every language that's life as some say.
