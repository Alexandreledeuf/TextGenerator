Josie it´s been a long hard day
Down the road to where it´s at
I must have lost my way
When I got there they said I was too late
Now you´re the only one can get me straight
So won´t you sing me a rainbow Josie
Roll me a song
Just tonight make it right
Cause it´s been wrong for oh so long
There´s lots of shades of darkness, Josie
Deep inside a man
So sing me a rainbow if you can
The train I went to meet
Had come and gone
Seems like I spend all my time
Gettin´ off and gettin´ on
I sold my mind
And gave my dreams away
And tomorrow I´ll start lookin´
´Round for yesterday
But til then
Sing me a rainbow Josie
Roll me a song
Just tonight make it right
Cause it´s been wrong for oh so long
There´s lots of kinds of hunger Josie
You don´t understand
So sing me a rainbow if you can
If you can, If you can
Sing me a rainbow if you can.
