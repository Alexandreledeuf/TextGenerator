She woos and coos with all her secrets
Leaving all in her universe own opened sacred
Through ages and eons slowly descending
Like mist being swaddled across the green.
When she traversed to her edges of age
Like silken spring showering over her glaze
Keeping her promises like saints and seers
Being curious of dives fast in the oceanic vast.
As she pounces the pear and peg of her day
Peeping through her thrumming womb of love
On the bathing platform of her living a day
Lovers and oomph appears impassioned.
When she jitters to be lost beyond her edge
Running  all her length half necked, half robed
Her mysteries move like rainbow in the moist sky
Caressing her newly born just crying soiled son.
