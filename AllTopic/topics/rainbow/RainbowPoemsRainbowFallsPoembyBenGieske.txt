(Jackson County, Ky)
We liked to go there
dropp down beside its cascading waters
peer into its collected coolness
sidle up to the edge of its lap
thinking of taking a leap
Seemed like no one ever came ––
but we knew –– that others too
stole to this place
drawn to lean over its lip and flirt
with its rainbow’s end
Our hearts still meld
in the rainbow there
in Jackson County.
