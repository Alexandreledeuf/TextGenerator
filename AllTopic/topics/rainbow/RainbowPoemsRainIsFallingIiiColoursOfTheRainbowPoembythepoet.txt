After the rain, the drops from heaven,
Comes the rainbow, a ray from heaven,
Seven colours fly high together,
Lighting the wet sky with power.
Through the colours you can see,
Sparks of life deep within the breeze,
Each symbolizes a part of me,
Where it flows within at ease.
Radiant red,
The crimson flame within me,
Gives me the will to carry on,
The symbol of incomparable strength.
Blooming orange
A raging explosion,
Signifying my determination,
To take on any task given.
Sunny yellow,
Bright and humorous,
The element of joy and laughter,
Putting a smile on my face.
Natural green,
In connection with Mother Nature,
The arch of caring and love,
Brings out my inner affection.
Calming blue,
The colour of the mighty ocean,
Where it roars wild and free,
Shows me the way to freedom.
Sparkling indigo,
A soothing and welcome presence,
Helping me find my way,
With wisdom and wit.
Vivid violet,
So beautiful, so unreal,
Creating all my purple dreams,
Directs the road to my desires.
'The colours of the rainbow,
Though graceful, it is humble,
Always a sight to beholdâ€¦
For it shows the colour of your soul.'
