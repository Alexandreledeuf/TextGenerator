Life is like a Rainbow
Every colour gives us energy
Changes our mood
Converts energy to positive
When we actually need the most! !
Colours adds life to our living…
While driving home from my office
I saw the most beautiful
Vibrant Rainbow!
It was on my side
Almost moving with me.
I was passing under the arch
It was so beautiful
I was so crazy
I turned my face
On the other side of the sky,
To capture the beauty in my camera.
Oh! I lost it?
The Rainbow was gone
I was shocked and disappointed
I turn off my camera
And looked to my left…
There it was!
The beautiful streams of colour
Were vibrantly stretch across the sky.
I smiled
And thought
It would be sad if
The world has no Rainbow
Its truly an amazing site to see
Life just would not be the same
Without the colour of the Rainbow! !
I love RAINBOWS! !
