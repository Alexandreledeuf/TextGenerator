The rain drops fall
The sun comes out
And all thats left is a beautiful rainbow
People stop and stare
at the unmissable sight
All the colours
In seven neat rows
The clouds blurr
the rainbow does too
As it disappears
It fades and fades
Now it has gone
the noise returns
We'll have to wait
For the next time it rains
