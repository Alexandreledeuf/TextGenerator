Breath  when sheathed by the web of ebbs
I still remember the rainbow by the blue moon
Your ripples when slither by the resonance
When you flossed into the moon
by the rainbow when blurs
blood when turns to tears by the fire
yet the thunder crakes the earth elsewhere
love when falling ruefully across the dew
Red of the blood yet whirls fast in the heart
White when blemishes my god innate
Images delve deep into your dreams as blotted
when I embrace blue when unabashed
Death when conquered  by the dream
As you slowly melted to mingle into the waves
I keep on benign look to the mist when reflexed
yet I am never alone even if  lie lonely
by your reminiscence from the truth
as day when dies bereft of sun by the shadow
night when cries out for the moon when alone
yet deep dark night turns to the light
the scar unflappable when sparks in me
the outcry besotted may diffuse my quest
the mute flow of the silence touches you nearer
as you steeped in blue by the eyes in the evening
still your song in allegiance promises me of my love.
As the speckles of your whisper touche me ever
And your sparkled eyes rebound within eternal
