Gods made me earths rainbow maker
I pour the colors from His paint cans.
He gives us all this beauty after a storm
colorful beauty across blue skies and green land.
He leaves the stars to another
to dust and polish them bright.
So that they adorn our evening skys
stars glistening in the heavens bright.
Now the blue in the sky and the clouds of white
are but anothers job you see.
They are blessings from our Lord above
for all God's children to enjoy their majesty.
I am God's rainbow maker
so look for me after the rain.
Each color will always be vivid
God's promise, He shall never flood earth again.
