There is a Bow in the Sky
It has all the Colors inside
after every Rain that passes by
It's to let us know
One of God's Promises
The Rainbow
The Promise was made, To remind everyone
God would Never Flood the earth again
Like He did way back when
In Noah's Time
Just Look to the Sky, after each Rain
You'll Find, It's very Plain
It's to Show, How Powerful! God Really is! ! !
No one can make a Rainbow! Only God Almighty!
So, You know God is True, To Believe in Him,
Become Born-again, Through His Son, Jesus
To be with Him, In Eternity!
Because He lets you know, with even the show
Of God's Glorious Rainbow! ! !
