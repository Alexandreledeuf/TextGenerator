What wonderful colors surround us
As we enter the summer season
Tiny buds have opened up
And they have a very good reason
For the sun brings out lots of people
And also brilliant flowers
Just when they’re ready to wilt
Along come a few little showers
Yellow is perfect for Marigolds
Purple Dianthus smell ever so sweet
Lilies come out in all colors
They’re such a summertime treat
The smells in the air are delightful
Lifting up our spirits so nicely
Some have a honey sweet smell
And others are just a bit spicy
So enjoy nature’s perfection
This is the season that truly shines
For before you know it, folks
We’ll leave this nice weather behind!
