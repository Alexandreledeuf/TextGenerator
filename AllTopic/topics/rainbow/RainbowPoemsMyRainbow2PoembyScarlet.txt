my rainbow has changed
for it has faded
for now it just many shades of grey
some darker
some lighter
so worse that others
for I shut down my emotions yesterday
so that those who hurt be would not see me cry
but now I can not seem to turn them on again
it is as if my emotions are lost
all expect for pain
the pain never went away
that I can hide
bury within
but where have all the colors gone
will it ever return
so will I stay in a state of gray
for it is  no longer a rainbow
but a grey scale
