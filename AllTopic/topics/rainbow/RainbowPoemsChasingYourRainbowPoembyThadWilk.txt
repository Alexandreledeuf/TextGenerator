A rainbow does not stay too long,
for everyone to see. So I hurry to
the end of it, to what awaits for me.
~
At the end of my rainbow, I believed
the story true. I'd find all the treasure
I could ever long for. Not gold, nor
jewels, but you!
~
I needed not, a pot of gold. It can't keep me
warm, when nights grow cold. I need
your love '' the only thing ''. 'Tis a treasure
that gold could never bring.
~
So hurry chase '' your  rainbow ''! Don't wait
til it' too late on on your next rainy day. The
happiness that you may seek, could quickly
fade away.
~
Now each time I see a rainbow arched across
the velvet skies. I think of you and our love so
true, as these colours pass mine eye's.
