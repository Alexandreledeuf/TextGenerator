At the end of the rainbow
lies our dream of reverie.
At the end of the rainbow
lies loveâ€™s destiny.
We walk through the world together
facing each day as it comes.
Smiling through the good ones
and frowning through the bad,
but always together
to face another dawn.
Forever always onward
through to the sunset of our days.
