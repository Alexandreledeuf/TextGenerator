SPECKLES OF RAINBOW
time yet flies by the shadow
sun still strong by its swanky walks
swampy stream yet not desiccated by the fire
as i remember the last night by the passion
the dream still burns me in its cruised arms
and i am just half backed bone by the rays
scorching sun prides beneath the lamp post
night yet to come by the day when retires
shadow still burns bristling by the ashes
meadow when yells to dark clouds by the green
breeze yet not blown by feathers swing
cuckoo still in its nest by the hunger
yet your whispers tells me the woes by the hope
over the vale of tunes haunting the colored glow
would you not come back again by the purple blue
rain still in its wait by speckles of rainbow when desired
