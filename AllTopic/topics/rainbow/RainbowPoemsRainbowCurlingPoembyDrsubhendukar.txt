RAINBOW CURLING
I swear and swear me when rainbow curling
In the premises of her love and life delight
When tears of joy searching the redemption
To quench the thirst of smiles imbecile
The mist of love infallible as I do all peer
Sizzling across the petals of rose fragrant
In the bondage yet unfazed and unflinching
Yet unmeasured  in all dimensions surmised
winds of fragrance carrying  message I do love
thrums me and my universe to rouse my anger
that trembles along the corridor of my time
tossing on colors of rainbow into realm ecstatic,
