The rainbow of colors
So merry and bright
Each color has a purpose
Even black and white
The rainbow is so full
Of radiance and gleam
It sparkles and shines
Through every little beam
After a storm
A rainbow you'll see
With all the glaring colors
A rainbow there'll be
Then at the end
Your dream will come true
A pot of gold awaiting
All just for you
