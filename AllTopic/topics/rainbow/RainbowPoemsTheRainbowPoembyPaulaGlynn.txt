I love the rainbow with its shades of green and blue,
I love the way the rainbow tells itself to you.
I love the way the rainbow lights up a sunny sky,
I love the way the rainbow tells of truths that are a lie.
I love the rainbow with its every brightly coloured shade,
I love the way the rainbow lights up a sunny day.
