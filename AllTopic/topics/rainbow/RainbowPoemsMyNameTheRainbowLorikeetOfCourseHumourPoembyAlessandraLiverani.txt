There’s no such thing as a nice shade of brown
I don’t want a pastel or grey coloured crown
Purple, that’s more like it, and not in tones muted
Vivid orange and yellow is to what I’m much better suited
“Less is more! ” What feather brain uttered those words?
A sparrow or wren, those dull, drab speckled birds
I’m bright and I’m bold, decked out in every hue
Watch me, in Technicolor, it’s a spectacular view
Glimpse a flash of my feathers and you’ll gasp in amazement
Get used to it, pick your jaw off the pavement
I represent resplendently the entire colour spectrum
Take a photo, why not? The charge, there is none.
