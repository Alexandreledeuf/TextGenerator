R.ainbows in the sky reminders of you
A.lways feeling sheltered with the colours shining through
I.n my psyche you are here
N.ever gone and always near
B.ow down to the earth when the colours give their birth
O.ver the sky see the stripes flutter by
W.alking solitude inside the rainbow with you as my guide
S.omeone to shine over me
