I hear you
and feel your touch
on the keyboard each night.
I am here for you
and understand that spirit
you bestow
with each view and visit
each encouragement
you bring me
with each read.
This time is short time
and you will soar away
from bad time
to good time
overcome each
hidden away hurt
each unrecognized
human trait you possess
because you are me
in my own early years;
your faith is; has endless depth;
give your self the patience
and the faith
and you will emerge the butterfly
and you will be fine
you will be alright.
My hand
extends
herewith
to your hand
and offers
my appreciation
of you
and who
you are
and
becoming.
