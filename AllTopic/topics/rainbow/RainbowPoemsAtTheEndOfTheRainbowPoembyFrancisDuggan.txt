At the end of the rainbow in fable 'tis told
The Leprechaun he hides his bronze pot of gold
And if you should catch him hold on to him tight
Or he will quickly disappear out of your sight
If he escapes from you him you may never see again
Whilst firmly in your grasp your eyes on him must remain
Until his hidden fortune to you he will show
Hold on to him tightly do not leave him go,
He will say I will show you where my gold is hidden if you first set me free
But if you do that out of sight he will flee
Then his pot of gold on your own you won't find
In such an instance one has to be cruel to be kind
But 'twould seem 'tis only a mythological story that has often been told
That at rainbow's end the Leprechaun hides his pot of gold.
