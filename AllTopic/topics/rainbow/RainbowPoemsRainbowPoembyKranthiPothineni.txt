Seven colors of rainbow
Looks like a embow
Embow without a vow
But hearts says wow
By seeing colorful bow
Bow forms after rain
Rain hear means pain
Pain means a gain
Gain should not vain
Vain in colors of fain
Fain is good
But not food
To cross wood
It spills blood
Like a flood
Floods if you rest
In its colorful nest
Its a killing pest
So live your best
To clear its test
Its test of control
So make a enrol
Like tank full petrol
Build a firing role
To make life console
