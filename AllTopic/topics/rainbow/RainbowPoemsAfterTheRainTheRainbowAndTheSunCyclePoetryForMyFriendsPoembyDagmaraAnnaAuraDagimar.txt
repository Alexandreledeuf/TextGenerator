clouds and is already starting to rain
rainy morning
greyness behind my window
I welcome ungwillingly
rainy drops
are typing against the window still
after the rain glitter is dew
fleeting treasure of the nature
on vivid green
garden fresh
only white rose
my treasure into your hands
the day quickly is passing
tomorrow it is a time for sun
and our love
(for CO)
