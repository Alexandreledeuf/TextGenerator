all my life I lived in grey and black, blue and red.
black was depression
gray was numbness
blue was sadness
red was anger
those were the colors of my life
the emotions of my life
that was my rainbow
I went from one to another a back
everyday I would bounce
back and fourth from one color to another
I did not know of any other colors
I did not know there was any other colors
I thought it was normal
but now I know it wasn't
it was far from normal
I should have known
I should have realized
that everyone was happy
but I never knew of happiness
I didn't think it existed
but now I know
for my rainbow has grown
I now have more colors
yellow for joy
pink for love
green for happiness
for now I know
that other colors exists
that other emotions exists
I still have my old colors
But the are not alone
And not that strong
Because I have other colors
Other emotions to balance them
