If I walk to the end of my rainbow
will there be a pot of gold?
Will rainbow travel be worth
the hassle?
If I succeed
then suppose
I find that I am not as worthy
as other Rainbow Walkers?
If I am not,
I'll be exposed
as fraudulent.
If I walk to the end of my rainbow
while I be happy?
Or just as sad
as I now am?
How do I know that Rainbow Walking
is worth it all?
My uncle used to say
that 'having dreams that you
or the world will be different at the
end of the rainbow
has a flaw.
After walking and succeeding
you'll still be there.
Rainbows don't glow
if you don't.'
Never understood
what he was talking about
till later on.
Now I really really like
the Rainbow in me
and no matter where I walk
it's aways there
and I realize
I am
my own
pot of gold.
And other people too
if you look close
at some of them
(not all of them)
are their own pot too.
Life is all about
spotting the pot of gold
in me
and in you.
