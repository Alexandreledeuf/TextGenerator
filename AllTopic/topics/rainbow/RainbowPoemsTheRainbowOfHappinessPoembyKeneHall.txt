Over the rainbow bluebirds scatter,
Nothing's there to really matter.
A shaft of light born of love,
From the womb of life
Pierces the axis of your being
Your home.
No need to climb that mountain,
No need for promised lands,
No need to climb that fence,
The shaft of light has told you,
You're sitting on a golden seat,
See,
Your Eden's.
Lying all around your feet.
