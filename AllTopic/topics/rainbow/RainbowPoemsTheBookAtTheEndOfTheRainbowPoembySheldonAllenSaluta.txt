I can compare the beauty of my life in a rainbow
And I will laugh and day “oh”
‘Cause it’s perfect to have a comparison
Because my life is so colorful like the rainbow with reason
…like burning rays of RED…
My life has many gallons of strife
But I used to stand firm from it
…like an electrifying scar of ORANGE…
Even I’m living in recent time
But I can’t help myself looking at my back
…like an autumn blossom of YELLOW…
Fortune is not hard to seek
Sometimes, it hugs me and shows me the beauty of life
…like a glamorous nature of GREEN…
I was been abundant of love
Love from my family, friends and special one
…like a deceiving look of VIOLET…
Sometimes, I found myself stumble
And so hard to stand back and say “I’m okay”
…like horrifying aisle of INDIGO…
There are times that I feel like I’m drown
And there is no hand to help me
…like a silent string of BLUE…
When I feel like I’m alone
All I just did is to cry breathlessly
Bliss girdled me as I look at the rainbow in the sky
And I just want to fly high
To touch the colors and put it in my book
At the end of that rainbow, as a treasure, I will hide the book
