Raindrops sparkle any day
Look up the sky for a ray
You may find a rainbow
Enjoy the pleasant Nature's color show
First is Robust Red
Put some jam on your bread
Second is Opulent Orange
Time to have a glass of Tangy orange
Third is Yearning Yellow
Place your books in a row
Fourth is Gracious Green
It comes exactly in-between
Ask your friend 'how have you been? '
Fifth is Beautiful Blue
See  the vast sky hue
Sixth is Ingenious Indigo
Say 'See Ya' before you go
Seventh and last is Vibrant Voilet
Thank God! we didn't get wet
If you don't find a rainbow, don't be sad
Wear a smile, we all will be glad!
