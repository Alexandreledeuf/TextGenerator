I feel like talking
Telling everyone about you
About the love we have both found
And the rainbow across my heart
That is there for all eternity
I feel like walking
Under the bright moonlight
Feeling the warmth
Of your body close to mine
And the rainbow across my heart
There until the end of time
I feel like listening to the music
That fills the air all around me
Now that love has captured me
Leaving that rainbow across my heart
There for all eternity
