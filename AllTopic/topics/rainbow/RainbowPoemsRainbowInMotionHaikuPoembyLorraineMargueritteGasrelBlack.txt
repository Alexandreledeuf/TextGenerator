Red, orange, yellow
green, blue, indigo- violet
mystic vision arcs
Red, orange yellow
green blue indigo follow
graceful violet glows
Red orange yellow
green blue indigo follow
violet rainbow mists
Shy crescent appears
lifting happy spirits soar
listen to my wish
Lively prism light
enchanting rainbow delights
brightly dance then hides
Sunbow or rainbow
Heaven's mysteries parting
Iris's raiment
Painting in rainbows
fairies alight  gems dancing
upon the flora
Thin 'bow ribbon floats
colours capture bauble- beads
bubbles fly away
The waning Moon sets
cold ocean meets horizon
a rainbow shares sky
Peaceful lotus pond
two swans bow heads gracefully
frogs bask in 'bows end
A double rainbow
appears reflects faint image
imitates its light
Two rainbowed secret
paints reflected illusions
colours in reverse
Violet indigo
blue green yellow orange red
second 'bow brings awe
Unexpected scene
second 'bow riddle answered
shy mirrored likeness
First to disappear
the second rainbow lingers
grants a special wish
Lavender to pink
misty space between two arcs
colour magic spell
Blind or enlightened
Soul's rainbow fills the vessel
mind and body blessed
A moment in time
upon the cloudy climes shine
bring me more rainbows
Lucky is the one
who espies rainbow arches
wishes may come true
Rainbow guardian
spirit spray hovers over
cascading water
When rain dances and
the Sun  shines Earth  rejoices
misty rainbow's gift
Dreams, desires, wishes
granted in a million jewels
glittering rainbow
A rainbow's gift leaves
joyful laughter, thoughts and awe
mostly Nature's smile
Seven rays of light
herald the tempest's ending
a smiling sky shines
From moonstone coloured
misty clouds the  Sun refracts
rain drops upon Earth.
A walk through a 'bow
bestows blessings upon when
Soul's pearls awaken
Bond  seven  swirling
chakra discs root  raised  to crown
inner peace regained
Looking at rainbows
can mean different things and
shared by everyone
Rainy guardian
a 'bow to walk under hugs
opposite gender
Always look for rainbows
appearing opposite the
Sun's teasing visage
A rainbow omens
depending on local lore
early death or wealth
Preparing for rain
keeps it away but then the
rainbow disappears
In the East rainbow
shines then  pleasant will the next
day's afternoon be
A morning rainbow's
Westerly ride omens wet
cloudy days ahead
Rainbow to leeward
dampness goes away sailors
delight in Night's arc
Rainbow to windward
portends whole day foul sailors
heed weather warning
As the Irish say
a rainbow on Saturday
wet weather will stay
For those who are lost
to the living day tears cross
Rainbow Bridge Heaven
Airy Baby's Breath
gather a rainbow bouquet
Life's long lasting bloom
Softly glowing or
vibrantly showing proud Sky's
enchanting decor
Sigh poet dreamer
then listen to the rainbow's
awakening song
Believe the Rainbow's
magic touch upon lovers
dreamers and forlorn
Can a bird in flight
touch a rainbow and  lose a
wishgranting feather?
Fern and grass aglow
rainbow-hued droplets pearling
Dawn's golden music
Silent  'bow  aglow
sentinel collects wishes
then takes them away
A lonely crescent
hiding pastel evening shine
sighs across the sea
Long, long time ago
Rainbow appeared and promised
no end to this world
A peaceful peacock
perched amidst rainbow blooms
dwells in Paradise
Rainbows in motion
Nature's magical gift stirs
luminescent awe
Whatever joy brings
the elixir of life  or
high  expectations
Joyous  sight behold
unfolding drifting  graceful arc
heavenly colours
Misty promise made
sunny days ahead  storm's ending
I see ROY G  BIV
Rainbows inspire
set fire imagination
soul's journey unfolds
On earth I wonder
how the rainbow arc  bridges
Destiny's wishes
Under and over
the rainbow haunts dreamlike quest
Leprechaun's treasure
Soft pastel rainbow
briefly  meets the frozen rain
mountain snow glistens
Muse come dance with me
soft voice floats among the clouds
Your  rainbow crown shines
Across the rising
full Moon face a rainbow graced
rosy sunset clouds
Pour ethereal
shining droplets from the clouds
sunkissed spirits 'bow
Brushed by a rainbow
the angel of the winds touch
Heaven's tears of joy
Colourful dreamer
fading into blushing sky
I bid you good  day
