A groan still roars
In the private quarters
Of many slowly healing
Shattered hearts
Like the roar of a tempest
That could even dim
The evil spewing crashes
That tore down the proud symbol
Of American Success last autumn;
A dolorous cry restrained
But reveberates in a spasm
Of agony made worse in
The dead of night by
The poignant memories of
Loved ones' sudden demise,
A loss that only relentless
Prayers could help mend.
Far away, a Noah-styled rainbow
Crowns the sky; a heaven's
Promise to end pain and drain?
In earnest, we all pray
For a better tomorrow;
A world free from misunderstandigs,
Religious bigotry, riots,
Hypocritism, racism
And ruinous power struggles.
Has any civilisation ever
Really gained from these?
