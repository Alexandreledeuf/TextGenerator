Amazing lady you..
like  you has never been..
like him has never seen..
and no one will know,
At night at the sea..
when there you will be..
in the wind you and who,
you will dance with the wind
when the start never end
with the waves both flow,
dropp me back to the rain
keep with you the Love's chain
then back me to the bow,
the amazing one are you...
water me and the buds.
teach the buds how to grow,
Your words like the touch,
your touch like the dew,
Keep on singing every day
toward you open the way
then the feeling let it glow,
keep on raising rate of beats
then the raising keep slow..
BROKEN HEARTS I TREAT..
n your breathing let me live
let me come, let me go..
let the sadness..me  to blow,
how the chance became dance..
how the arts of the parts
let me see and you show..
God CREATION God draw,
words from the heart
from the feeling i will sew..
....................................
The wondrous one are you.......
