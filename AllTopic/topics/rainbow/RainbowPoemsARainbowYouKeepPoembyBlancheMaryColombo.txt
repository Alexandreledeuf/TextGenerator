Run after a rainbow
and catch it
put the rainbow
in your pocket
take it out and look at it.
When it rains
or when you are sad
change rain into snow
and sadness
into joy
with the rainbow you saved.
Rainbows are magic
if you believe
in yourself and God
Because God is all powerful
and you are really you.
