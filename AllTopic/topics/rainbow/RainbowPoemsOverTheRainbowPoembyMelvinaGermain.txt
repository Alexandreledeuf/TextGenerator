Over the rainbow,
a kaleidoscope of colors mingle.
Reflecting the morning sun.
Birds fly among it’s hues,
while raindrops dance the ballet
of spring, a minuet, till day is done.
Over the rainbow,
the sound of harpsichords play.
Embracing the radiance of angels
flying through each brilliant display.
A ray of sunshine takes precedence
as it points it’s glowing finger to the ground.
Voices resonate,  through iridescent view,
showering songs of beauty all around.
Over the rainbow,
the silhouette  of Jesus appears.
Escorted by angels hovering over him,
he flows through the air.
His arms extended as he gestures with his hand.
Come to me my children, come, yes you can.
