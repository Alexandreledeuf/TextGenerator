Then on the twenty first
Then let the tangent
Showers of water in tungsten
The golden rainbow
The green cool of the fabric
There were three pillows and a cushion
Many of your toys
The weave was like silk on cashmere
The broken cup could not be repaired
The art of antiquity is vanished
It hung on to my fingers
It shall hang on to the mind's eye
Many years have come to an end
Where from you discovered
The twenty and one days
I once have had
Some touches of love
Did you have some premonitions
