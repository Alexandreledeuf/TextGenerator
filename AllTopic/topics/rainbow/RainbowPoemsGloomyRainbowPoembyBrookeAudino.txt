Gloomy rainbow...
Oh how the pain doesn't seize to grow...
Watching the days go by...
All I want to do is cry...
I let our love go...
even though I loved you so...
The days go slower everytime I'm reminded of you....
and all the things we used to do...
I plead to you to take me back...
But you say no because of my brutal attack...
That I had to your heart....
And it tore us appart....
I know I was a fool...
He made me think he was cool...
But now I know...
I love you so....
Please take me back to you...
and I hope my love shines through to you...
Looking now to the sky...
I wish I could forever die...
Unlike my love forever grows....
Oh what gloomy rainbows...
