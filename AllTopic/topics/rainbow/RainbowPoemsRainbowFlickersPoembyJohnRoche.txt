Morning breaks.
Shafts of rainbow's light
flood the stained windows
of last week's existence.
The radiance plays
iridescent games
in the shadows of my slumber,
forcing recognition
of a new beginning.
I peel back the shutters,
exposing the dim recesses
to the new day,
and wonder what may lie in store
at the end of that rainbow.
