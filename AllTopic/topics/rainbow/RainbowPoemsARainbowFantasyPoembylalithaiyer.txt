as a Child
I picked up shells
and kept in my manor
in secret holes
they were my desires
hidden from the public
and soon I forgot
and left them behind
when I grew up
and found new pearls
I neglected the shells
full of soiled soles
but, my mansion dented
and passions demented
my life filled with tides unmeant
