The stillness
After the storm
Comes into view
Multicolored promise
Loved-filled expressions
Of varied sentiments
Yet quite focus
Intimate panorama
Though seldom come
This love I feel
Like the rainbow
I dedicate this to you
You may not appreciate
the beauty of the colors
Of my words
Less this sincere heart
Still I will prevail
To stand proud
Till the time you realize
The love sign in the rainbow
I may not be perfect
As you see me covered
By the superficial hues
But it's where I exist
For as long as I breath
Rainbow of love stays
Come what may
It will be forever
