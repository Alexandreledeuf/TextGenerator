You came to me, in confidence,
calling my name, half-teasingly,
but you never said anything more.
You wanted me to hear you,
to know you were there,
but not to interfere.
I feel your kisses
and soft stoking on my forehead
under moonbeams
and I am no longer afraid.
The other day,
I found myself at the end of a rainbow
and I had to smile
because you always had your way of being right
and you always said the treasure would not consist of gold,
and the treasure was the rainbow.
