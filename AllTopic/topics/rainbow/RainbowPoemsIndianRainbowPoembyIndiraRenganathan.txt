The dhuppatta of the Indian angel
Sprawling over there far in the ether
A half-saree rather arched providential
Seven coloured, a shamiana-splendour
Respectful Violet hopeful to be honoured
Narcotic Indigo dreaming to get refreshed
Lovely Blue calm to be loved
Fulcrum-Green effectively to be sensed
Self-confident Yellow preaching to be bold
Splendid Orange ever stepping to succeed
Vital Red brimming invigorated
The dhuppatta in ether plumes
Emoting the angel's attributes
And the angel is like the lotus
Sunken wedded in the sun's bliss
Her dhuppatta too, look, with her in sinks
