The sun sinks golden o’er the sea
The stars begin to sparkle bright
Across the sand you walk with me
That wave enchanted summer night
What pleasures in your eyes did glow
Like tide and moon in ebb and flow
chorus
From hearts of fire to the coldest star
What kind of love do you hide?
From the broken people at the broken bar
What kind of love? – a rainbow inside!
Beauty of heart is truth I know
We are only ever what we feel
In life we reap just what we sow
We have to trust to make love real
With you I’m in Heaven above
We are only living when we’re in love
There’s a fire dancing on the river
A spirit sings and calls your name
It’s here and now, the soul’s forever
In your eyes I see the flame
O hold me darling till night goes by
Hold me sweet DARLING let me cry.
