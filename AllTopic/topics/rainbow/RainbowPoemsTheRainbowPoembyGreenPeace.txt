The  rainbow appears in the blue sky after the rains,
It is a vista of hope in the dark and pains.
The rainbow comprises of seven colours i.e. vibgyor.
Each is significant in its own manner.
Violet signifies royalty(bravery and loftiness) .
Indigo underlines authenticity.
Blue highlights peace
Green the colour of vegetation and prosperity.
Yellow signifies brightness
Orange the colour of asceticism.
Red remarks bravery and temper.
Night follows the day,
making all cheerful and gay.
Darkness follows the light.
Encouraging all, to the evils fight.
Happiness follows the sorrows
Which none can lend or borrow.
Sometimes sun and sometimes rain
Buffeted all alone in the mighty ocean of
grievances and pain
When all the hopes dash the ground and arises
a feeling of low.
After the rains up above the sky shines the magical rainbow.
It is a lantern in the dark.
Its appearance is as sweet as the words of a lark.
Its colours are each of a different meaning
It is in disguise to us a blessing.
