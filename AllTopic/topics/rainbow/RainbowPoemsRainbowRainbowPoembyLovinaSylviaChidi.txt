I know as I look at you out from my window
Tomorrow you retreat back to your shadow
Today stripes of colors brighten my disco
Red, orange, green, blue, violet, and yellow
So rainbow, rainbow
Before you give the elbow
Take it nice and slow
Let your colors gaze at me and glow
Make the warm sunshine once again flow
Today you display your colorful cargo
With your yellow as bright as a meadow
You stand on your own curved beautifully solo
With colors I find so beautiful to swallow
So rainbow, rainbow
Before you give the elbow
Take it nice and slow
Gaze at me and glow
Let my sunshine flow
