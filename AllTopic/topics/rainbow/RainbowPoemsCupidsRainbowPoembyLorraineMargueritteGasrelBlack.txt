Leaving rainbows in my sleep
Only vision softly creeps
Venus slain to rise again
To share the light and quell the pain
Stardust shimmers like the past
Prisms shattered or everlast
Evasive whispers in my heart
Carves the image my soul imparts
Voices chime in dreams of glass
The future in the hour cast
Immortal as time's frailty
Unending with mortality
And in the dust the diamond makes
Within my heart reverie wakes
Alone you haunt, your essence chase
With the Sun the Moon is chaste
In the mind illusions dwell
Only the heart will clearly tell
Better my love to you before
Glows the morrow even more.
