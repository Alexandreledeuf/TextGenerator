As the ruby roses blossom
In the inner field of my bosom,
Allow my potpourri of best wishes
Perfume you with celestial bliss;
Let the rainbow of joy arch on your face.
As the orange sun generously shining
To give you the brightest morning,
Hear the birds that I sent you to sing
My simplest and ordinary greeting
With prayers for more blessings.
Celebrate like a xanthous butterfly
Dancing with breath of boundless sky
As you blow the candles on the cake
Chocolate moist from heaven sweetly baked;
Garnished with colors of gladness on God's plate.
Emerald field of grasses kissed by the sun
Reminds me of you as your life expands
Growing up and working with effective hands.
I'm wishing you to enlarge your territory,
Stretch up your hands to reach the star of victory.
Sapphire ocean of life is getting more deep;
Inviting you to take an exciting dip
Just to have more zestful life to live.
As the countless waves bless the shore,
I'm praying for you to be happy more.
My pen keep jotting with indigo ink,
I close my eyes, come to my mind and think
Of seeing you with your angelic face
Filled with sweetness of heaven's kiss,
Bathing in the pool of timeless happiness.
May the purple cloud of God's bounty
Shower you with more days of felicity.
Oh Sherlyn, to the world show your cream,
Scintillate with the lit of your heart's flame,
Soon you will live with your glittering dream.
