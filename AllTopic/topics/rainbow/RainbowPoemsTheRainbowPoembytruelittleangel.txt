let me fly....
Why should I have broken wings? ! ! ! !
My dreams appear there...
in the sky...
near the rainbow where birds sing...! ! !
let me fly...
dont stab, Now, the little girl inside me
with no mercy...
I dont wanna die...
let me fly, smile
help me to tear
that dark file...
and let me fly
high...
so so high...
till I reach that rainbow
and then die....
