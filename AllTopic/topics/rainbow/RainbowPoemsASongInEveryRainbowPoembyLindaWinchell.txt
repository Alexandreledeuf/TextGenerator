If I could place a song in every rainbow
so it could strum its tune in colored melody.
After all the storm clouds rolled away in your life
It would play softly its tune for you from me.
Songs of joy and hope and of laughter
in bright colors, they'd take away all your worries and despair.
Accompanied by a thousand Angels, singing in the sky
they would be singing just for you
too know that God and I are there.
I am placing some words of love down on this paper
so that you know that I will always care.
That if your feelings are not where you would have them be today
There is more than one person, in your life that cares.
You are grown and so far away I can not hold you
to kiss and wipe away each tear, like when you were very small.
But when you look up at God's given colored rainbows
you'll remember colored melodies of my Love, are playing in them all.
