I sit here alone,
in this dark place.
My mind has gone crazy,
my heart's in a race.
I sit here alone,
with my thoughts gone mad.
I feel I'm insane,
my life's turned bad.
I sit here alone,
as people pass by.
I scream to be heard,
but can't and cry.
I sit here alone,
I'm all messed up.
I have no control,
It's time to give up.
I sit here alone,
I can't hold on.
I'm losing my grasp,
My sanity's gone.
I sit here alone,
My freedom is here,
The struggle is over,
I won't shed a tear.
I sit here alone,
I shall never see light.
I have only darkness,
In my own world tonight.
