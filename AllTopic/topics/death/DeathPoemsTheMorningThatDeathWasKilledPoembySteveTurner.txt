I woke in a place that was dark
The air was spicy and still
I was bandaged from head to foot
The morning that death was killed.
I rose from a mattress of stone
I folded my clothes on the sill
I heard the door rolling open
The morning that death was killed.
I walked alone in the garden
The birds in the branches trilled
It felt like a new beginning
The morning that death was killed.
Mary, she came there to find me
Peter with wonder was filled
And John came running and jumping
The morning that death was killed.
My friends were lost in amazement
My father, I knew, was thrilled
Things were never the same again
After the morning that death was killed.
