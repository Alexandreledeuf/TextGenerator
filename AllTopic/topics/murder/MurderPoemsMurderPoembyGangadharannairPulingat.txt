Murder, dreaded form of death
One's life taken in his better days
Unfortunate thing happening
His hopes and aspirations left ever.
Murders, throughout the history
For power, money, hegemony brutal murders
Swords decided the fate of individuals
Mighty, and learned ones got murdered.
In great stories of William Shakespeare
We read about brutal murders
In the corridors of power, and struggles
The individuals in high esteem
Became the victims of murderers.
