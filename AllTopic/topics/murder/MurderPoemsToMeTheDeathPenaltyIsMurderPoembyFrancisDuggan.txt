Some Governments order the execution of drug runners after they have spent many years in jail
This is their idea of morality through justice but by their actions their ideas they do fail
Drug runners may not be good people but the death penalty for them or anyone unjustified
To have the death penalty in place in their constitution to any government should not be a sense of pride
If the wilful taking of human life is murder then the death penalty is murder too
For one to order the execution of another human being does seem such a callous thing to do
This person too does have a family and is grieved by a mum and a dad
You do not make yourself a good person by ordering the execution of one who is bad
To me the death penalty is murder i can see it in no other way
On this i only express my opinion though many may disagree with what i do say
Government leaders order the execution of murderers and drug traffickers if one of their own children were guilty of such a crime
They would not want them to be executed after serving years of prison time
To me the death penalty is murder leave the guilty to grow old in jail
Government leaders who order executions may see this as morality through justice but by their actions their ideas they do fail.
