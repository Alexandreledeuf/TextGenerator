It was a mystery right from the first
A murder had occurred you understand
It happened right in the Bissell mansion
A sight that is beautiful and grand
Everyone looked at one another
For who was the one to suspect?
Was he or she right beside us?
Nervousness was what we started to get
We ate our four-course dinner together
As though nothing had gone astray
The food was truly exceptional
And we didn’t have a single delay
But someone had killed our hero, Andy
And it couldn’t just be dismissed
Oh yes, we all loved this wonderful sheriff
He would definitely be forever missed
You want a little excitement, folks?
And blend right in with the plot
A murder mystery dinner theatre
Entertainment that we enjoyed a lot!
