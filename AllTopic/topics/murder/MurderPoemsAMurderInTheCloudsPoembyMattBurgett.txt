I had been wondering off
In this dream by which I was bound
Until I was awoken
By some horrific sound
I had come upon
This murder in the clouds
Way up I could be
And I couldn't help myself but to see
That poor murdered girl I saw that day
Way up in the air
Had a far away look in her eyes
And blood filled her hair
That day to me
Was so very clear
And there was not a single thing
That I had to fear
I remember everything
The red on white
The evil glare of deathly eyes
And that final devilish bite
An oh so perfect time
Had turned very bad
When a happy little girl was murdered
All because of her dad
He crashed her special day
With a hit on her life
That started with rays of sunshine
And ended with a knife
All fucked up on drugs
With his arm in a cast
His daughters special day
He wanted to be her last
And due to
A backstabbing son of a b*tch
An almost perfect life was ruined
By one heartless bruin
Because it was on that gloomy day
Amidst all of the crowds
That a poor girl lost her life
In what is known as the murder in the clouds
