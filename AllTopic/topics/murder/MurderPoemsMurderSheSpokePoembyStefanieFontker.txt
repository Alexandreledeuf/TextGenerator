I’ll follow her home like psychosis,
And penetrate her dreams.
Destroy my own heart with this love.
Negotiate a ransom for her mouth,
Her religion is the sharpest hurt.
I know I’ll end up on the end of her cross.
Sit her into a broken embrace,
And push her against metal ropes.
I’ll let her watch me slit my throat.
