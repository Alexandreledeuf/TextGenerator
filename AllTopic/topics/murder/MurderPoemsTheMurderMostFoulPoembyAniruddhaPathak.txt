The meanest of murder, axe nor machete,
Overwhelming greed the sole bleeding knife;
Cohorts of crime, manic men of market,
The fair lady herself— much freedom rife!
To save her skin she this defence did fake:
Infidels oft breed their own tragic ends—
Making out markets seem a sad mistake,
Not knife, she used her own barest of stands.
No, not in fear darling, ye died of hate,
In greed of growth I guess, guilt-edged progress,
And yet, ere ye fall to thine destined fate,
I blame less Lady Greed, more her excess.
If bleed ye must ye shall bleed not in vain,
If too much greed be reined in tight restrain!
