*Author’s Note: It is not the intent to malign, nor denigrate the memory of the two
people who died tragically. Rather, the composition addresses brief periods of levity apparent during the course of the 1995 trial proceedings.
Extraordinary talent of such persuasion
…As Uelmen's...analytical mind
A finagling.........F. Lee Bailey
When the man is so inclined
Surreptitiously...Alan Dershowitz
…Of the faculty…at Harvard Law
Looking over Ito’s shoulders
In search…of some…appellate flaw
And the bag-man…Robert Kardashian
Shrewdly…in charge…of luggage checks
Carl Douglas and Peter Neufeld
……And his sidekick…Barry Scheck
And Johnnie Cochran….and Shapiro
….Legal sharpies….all perhaps
Quite...at home…and most at ease
With the concept…of courtroom craps
William Hodgman…somewhat psychic
Brilliantly…feigned…a heart attack
Then disappeared…to his upstairs office
Too damned smart…to ever…come back
Goldberg…Kelberg…Cheri and Woody
Every utterance…A poetic display
Of Shakespearean prose…in its glory
…No finer thespians in all L.A.
Then there’s Harmon…squeezing Charmin
Just in case…it gets too deep
And there’s the fellow…at the table
Who…so often…appears asleep
Forever doomed…to a living...nightmare
Of  Simpson’s greatest…commercial hit
Waving and smiling….before the jury
…Christopher’s gloves…just don’t fit
….There is not…an adversary
More formidable…than Marcia Clark
Which leaves one…somewhat…confused
And lost…completely…in the dark
……Most…of all…Gil Garcetti
Analyzing…his wayward scheme
What the Hell….is Darden doing
……….On anybody’s…legal team
