Murder me
Murder with your love
murder me with you lies
You commit murder when I look in your eyes
You tell me over and over you love me
why canâ€™t we just live our lives
Murder commits suicide
Kill or be killed
No choice but to murder
Love is murder in the making
When you tell a person you love them
its murder in the 3rd degree
Rip me open from the inside
Until everything falls apart
The hurt just won't go away
Until it's everything I fear
You are everything I hate
Put me under your spell
Until I can't escape
