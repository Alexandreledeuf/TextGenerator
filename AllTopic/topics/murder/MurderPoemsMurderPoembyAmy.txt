A man stood in front of the judge
Stating his case, but they wouldn’t badge
He knew that he would never again be free
When the jury shouted- Guilty
He looked around the fickle room
And noticed there was not one inch of gloom
He looked around to find some truth
But only received words so uncouth
A tear dropp glistened in his eyes
To see the pain and a million lies
He walked out of the room, cuffed wrists
Seeing the culprit he bared his fists
He was in the wrong place at the wrong time
But now he’s in a place of grime
The year was nineteen fifty seven
He knew that day he’d go to heaven
He could never again discuss it further
As the death sentence was given for murder.
