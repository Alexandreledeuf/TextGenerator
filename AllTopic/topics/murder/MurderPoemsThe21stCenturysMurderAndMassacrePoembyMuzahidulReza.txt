Ongoing the 21st century's free style massacre
The horrible morning has started there in Myanmar,
Satan is tormented by theses and has come down
To learn the massacring styles in special gown,
But no one has yet directly protested the bestiality
So the massacrers gigantically speed up in cruelty;
So long the morning! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
The massacrers are devouring the breakfast for long
With soft bloody flesh and red soup again and again
And preserving the rest for the future want in time;
I don't know when and where will be the noon?
And then when and where will be the evening?
And then when and where will be the cursed night?
For the final maelstrom and the devastating fight
Or shall the morning cover the whole day only?
And then when will a morning start peacefully?
