This is it,50th and C Streets
Damn school's crumbling down
Right down around our knees
See them apartments, them over there
With all them nailed up boards
Covering all the windows and doors
Well, it sure as hell aint a home
No, not for nobody no more
Yeah, happened right over there
'Bout 3 AM heard someone say
Well, just two queers out late
Okay two trannies, it's all the same
All right, whatever, two transsexuals, okay
Ukea and Stephanie, yep, that's the names
Sure, 'course they did, just a sec, wait
Ukea Davis and Stephanie Thomas, okay
Well, just sittin' in their car, no, weren’t walkin’
18 and 19, yeah, just kids, sittin', talkin’
Semi automatic, each shot 10 times
Car came back twice, yeah a second time
Guess makin' sure they did it right
My kid huh, if my kid was like them
I'd throw ‘em out, disown ‘em
Don’t like them kinda’ people, alright
Yeah, I saw 'em around, in the neighborhood, why
I guess so, yeah, they were always nice
Yeah, they looked like girls, yep, always polite
Well, no, no one, not even trannies deserve to die
Not like that anyway, murdered execution style
But, they were queers, okay trannies, transsexuals, all right
Trannies oughta keep outa everyone’s sight
No one likes queers, okay trannies, transsexuals, right.
