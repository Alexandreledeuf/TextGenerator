The majority of Americans abhor conflict, especially war
Some carry placards and parade in protest
Some join militia groups
Most do nothing
Yet, everyone supports war
How?
By electing corrupt and hawkish politicians
By paying taxes that support military expansion
By accepting and believing corporate media propaganda
By buying and eating genetically modified and fast food
By sending our children to schools that are nothing more than public daycare
By allowing banks to plunder retirement savings and steal homes by foreclosure
By allowing Wall Street skullduggery, with no accountability or arrests
By allowing the invasion and occupation of Sovereign Nations
By being ambivalent and complacent to the destruction of a once great Nation
Yes we are all guilty of murder by association;
Murder of Planet Earth
Murder of each other
Murder of our children
Worst of allâ€¦Murder of our soul
