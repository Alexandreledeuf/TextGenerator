The man in the locker room told me of their murders
'It is beyond evil.' he said.
Dave Franks a great preacher and good chaplain
at another time of sadness said:
'What an animal'
I can only sadly echo here:
'What an animal'
and shake my head in sadness
while trying to remember where
I have put my gun.
