on top of
a hill is
a house lighted
by a lamp
since the window
is open
and the night
is dark
something looks
like a firefly
in the sky
along the
footpath a naked
woman
is lying unconscious
inside the house
the man is
washing his hands
he closed the window
puts off the light
and in the darkness
begins his
journey to the world
of the wolves.
