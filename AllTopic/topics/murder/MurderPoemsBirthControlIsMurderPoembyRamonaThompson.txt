I don't care what you say
I don't care how much you deny it
You can't dance your wicked way around the truth anymore
More and more everyday
A crime is being committed
No use in lying, crying or pretending that it ain't happening
Birth control is murder
There!
I said it!
And no way will I take it back
Smothering God's plans for your body beneath your own selfish will is just not right
It's just not holy
It's a sin
That's what it really is
Plain and simple
If you don't want a baby, then for sure there must be something wrong with you
Cos no normal woman would want to take wait or take the chance that never have another shot at that dream
A dream that so many women scream, cry and would even die for
That's why I can't
I just can't understand how so many of you young women can be so selfish
So selfish and cruel that you would't give up a mere 9 months to carry a baby for another woman
No, instead you want to keep that perfect body for your own purposes
No, you would rather spit upon the hopes and dreams of your fellow childless women
Birth control is................MURDER!
Tell me ladies
Just when you are gonna get that through your thick selfish heads?
