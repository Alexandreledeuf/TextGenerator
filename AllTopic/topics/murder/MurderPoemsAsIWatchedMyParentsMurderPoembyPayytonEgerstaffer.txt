I cry out in shame
As I watched my parents murder
I don’t think I’ll ever be the same
He is what I call my abuser
I rock back and forth
Waiting for him to find me
He started talking about the north
And I could have sworn me he could see
For he walked right to my hiding place
But walked away taking something with him
I needed to get out of this space
But I knew he was still here I couldn't chance that whim
So I waited
Each moment that passed a little piece of me disintegrated
I faded
I was slowly denigrated
I waited for two days
Not chancing that he was still here
So I counted the ways
To see per chance that my parents were still there
I am alone
Forgotten and broken
I will never see the love stone for it was thrown
I want my parents back even though the will never ever be woken
