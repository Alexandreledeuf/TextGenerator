Imprisoned me to death
or a double-life unbailable sentence
I am pleading guilty
I have murdered the precious times
eversince
I am a needless slumberer
an hour waster
a clock watcher
a frivolous talker
employed in irrelevant employments
a day squanderer
a false-hope wisher
a luck seeker for  a job abroad
a jack in few trade collector
I have acquired trial and error skills
a hit and miss casual careers
I am loitering as self-acclaimed explorer
and keep writing impossible to publish anthology
I am shifting various courses
moving one place to place
I am spilling out all crystal fountain of my youth
I am spoiling much of them
Still at this very moment
I am regretting
I  keep on wishing
how could I live
them once again
without time-wasting?
Those precious moments
that meant to be spent
wisely but once -
I am now voicing out my
guilty feelings within
under oath!
