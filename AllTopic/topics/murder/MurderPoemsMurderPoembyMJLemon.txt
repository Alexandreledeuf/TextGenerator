friendly and kind
was murdered in the
parkade of the suburban mall
when the thug assaulted the
hockey mom
and raped innocence
unleashing the hands that
wrought undying fear from
childish dreams
The diamond will
welcome toddlers
every year
the ice rink will nurture
Olympic hopes
Lacrosse champions
will arise
and disappear
Skis and poles will hit the slopes
Just down the block
another soul shatters
behind the loading platform
exit two officers talk
sadly just another day
by a suburban mall
What's there to say
often dollars don't pay
for soccer balls
