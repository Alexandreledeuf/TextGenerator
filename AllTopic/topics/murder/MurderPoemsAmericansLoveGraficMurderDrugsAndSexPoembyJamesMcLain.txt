Where the grass is tall and green,
I mash it flat.
I watch her as she watches me,
Unobserved because.
America,
Is such a brutal culture, a modern brutal culture.
Half the channels on basic cable are about murder,
Sex, primitive reality shows,
Cop's telling the viewer how dangerous their job's
Are,
To justify the violence that they inflict upon
Their victims.
You've seen the white cop's chase down the black dude
And stupidly ask dude, why he ran.
I keep waiting to hear dude say to the cop, because
You shoot unarmed blacks almost every day.
But dude doesn't, he just adds on to his woes by talking
To the cop and it for him gets worse.
American's,
Love the butcher's, if an American doesn't love the butcher
Then there's something wrong with that American.
Violence, murder and more murder and the kind of sex that
You would have,
If you could only get away with it, where you live.
The only thing American's love more than a butcher, is
To give them a trial and wait for the judges, to cave in to
The mob mentality.
The mob want's a brutal death drawn out.
The Judge's know that no normal individual would commit
Such a crime.
We know the butcher's do.
Violence and Death isn't about love but American's love it.
There's nothing intelligent about watching,
Murder more murder,
drugged then sexed, but then most American's aren't that
Intelligent, now are they?
In America the moon is violated, the bush is stripped of
All it's leaves,
Tree's small or large are consumed by some, not all but
American's,
Need to see, feel taste and touch and smell it all.
Just like you do,
Was mummy dear, was daddy large, did you watch your
Sister or your brother, kill them all!
And vampires do what vampires do and drain U.S. all.
