The day is dying
Its bright blood smeared
On the azure blanket
See its light blinding no more
The orb resting its head on the horizon
Of salty diamonds
The clouds wipe the blood
Screaming to the heavens
As the birds moan in agony
Fleeing the incoming darkness
Of the murdering night
I can see the glowing smile of the moon
Her breath chilling
As she glares enviously
While a million knowing eyes
Watched silently, shivering in fright.
The sun succumbs to its death
Drowned by the rising tide
The night howls in triumph
And covers the land with its sickly glow
And we surrender to its call
Close our eyes and wait for the sun to return
