Murder the great sin
That commits only by humans
For petty reasons, and quarrels
Murder highly deplorable always.
Murder a horrendous crime
The tough criminals indulge
Where law of the land trials
And punish the guilty, law insists.
Designed murders on vengeance
Extremely cruel always
Where man changes himself as beast
And takes weapons against enemy
Commit the crime without pity
Humanity fails its nobleness.
Let us desire for a peaceful society
where murders are not an incident
An event to mourn and lose to family
We are supposed to live in unison.
