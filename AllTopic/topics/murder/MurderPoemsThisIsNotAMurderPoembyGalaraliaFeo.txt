There was a wine
on the table,
There were people
on the bench.
There was a smile
on their faces,
There was a love
in the air.
There was a past
in her heart,
There was a future,
in his mind.
There were buses
in the streets,
There was her
with him again.
There was a bed,
in old attic.
There were them,
in the sheets.
There was a morning,
on the window.
There was a blood,
on his hands.
