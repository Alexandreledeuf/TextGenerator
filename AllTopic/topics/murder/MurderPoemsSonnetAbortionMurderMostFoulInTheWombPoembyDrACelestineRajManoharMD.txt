God makes the buds that blossom into flow’rs,
And flow’rs to form the seeds for newer plants;
God gives sun-light and bathes the roots with show’rs,
And nutrition, protecting them from ants!
God makes each species propagate on earth-
A mystery and wonder, all must take;
God takes care of their every want from birth-
Food, water, shelter, freedom from each ache!
God breathed life into clay and called it ‘man’!
And loved him, more than every creature made;
And made from him, his partner called ‘woman’;
His love for man (woman)   will never fade!
‘Abortion- murder, most foul, in the womb! ’
Should mothers turn the sacred womb, a tomb?
Lovingly dedicated to all good mothers who
God-willingly serve to maintain the human race.
