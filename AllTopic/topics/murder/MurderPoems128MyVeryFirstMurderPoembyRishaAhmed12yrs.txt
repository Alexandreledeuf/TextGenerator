There is something bursting inside
That I want to tell you
I once committed murder at the age of three
I have to confess, I do
It all started on a warm summer night
When I was playing with my goldfish by putting it back and again taking it in a net
When my mom called me and I forgot about goldy
And it along with the net on the table I kept
Next morning every thing was normal
Until my sister rushed in to the room and said
That my little dear goldy who was my favourite pet
Was lying on the table, dead
Mom gave me a good spanking  but then
She apologized when she saw me cry
I think she realized that as I was only three
I didnâ€™t know that without water a fish could die!
