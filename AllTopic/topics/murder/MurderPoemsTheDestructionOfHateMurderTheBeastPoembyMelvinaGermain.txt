Brought up in a prejudice dysfunctional household.
Took away the heart that once lived within your soul
Fiery eyes of a demon, a  prejudice beast
Live your heart, conjuring up a deploring feast
You’ve hurt, you’ve maimed, took education away.
Took bright eyes and turned them a shade of gray.
Many years took  its toile on the likes of you.
Bad heart, failed kidneys, time to pay your dues.
You reside in a room on the other side of town.
No one visits, no one cares, you sit wearing a frown.
Time to think and reflect while your body breaks down
No legacy to leave, you failed all around
The same people you despised, harbored hate for years
are the people who now console, dry your tears.
Why waste your time in this blessed life,
to create heartache, hate and contribute to ones strife.
Remember what you give out, you get back ten times more.
Father time will surely visit, come walking through your door.
Pick yourself up, start now before it’s too late.
Stop the cruelty, the pain, the destruction of hate.
