Murder me
Murder with your love
Murder me with you lies
You commit murder when I look in your eyes
You tell me over and over you love me why can’t we just live our lives
Murder commits suicide
Kill or be killed
No choice but to murder
Love is murder in the making
When you tell a person you love them its murder in the 3rd degree with a guilty plea
25 years to life with no college degrees No chance you’ll ever be paroled
Murder
Murder Me
