It comes upon me, time and time again.
It's the grand finally my friend.
A Wicked poker game with all decadent men.
All holding out till the last minute.
Oh who's gonna win?
Is it another bluff?
Fiction or fantasy.
Oh baby rolling with the ecstasy.
Trial by the nights of pitch black sky.
Some say suicide,
Some say you never wanted to die.
Only god truly knows' why.
Denial and prejudice at the same time.
The judge and jury in a flurry attack.
The poor man had no time to react.
26 stab wounds creates a bloody mess.
You try to clean it up to your best, but with out success.
Vengeance for life.
No one will come see you.
Not this time you've done yourself in.
Let the punishment fit the crime.
Passionate or not,
a plea of temporary insanity with not an ounce dignity.
Cigarettes burns to the eye.
Pissing on the body as it burns and getting pleasure out of it.
A socially path, a sick son of a b*tch in which their no cure for.
Your keeping score after each murder.
Some would call you a serial killer.
I call you a soul stealer.
