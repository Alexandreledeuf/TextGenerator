He went to a public library that's quiet and free;
Arrested, he was, for  murder,  in the first degree;
Inside the library, there was a book to find,
Slowly he approached his victim, an ol' woman who's kind;
Close to her backside,  he stood lurking behind,
Little ol' granny was reading and paid him no mind;
Yep, the aroma in the air was coming from her hair,
Caused his nose to quickly twitch, bulge, then flair;
The quick use of his weapon caused her to drop dead on the spot,
It was the eyeball witness who saw, that's how he got caught;
Now the jury must see the weapon that t'was horribly used,
But the killer tried to hide his nose and loudly refused;
Cause of her death came from his loud sharp sneeze,
Made her heart quickly stop, quiver, and seize;
So his hands were shackled, the murder weapon viewed,
The jury gasped loudly for air, outraged was their mood;
Soon after his shnozzle was clearly depicted,
The jury was unanimous, ... they quickly convicted.
