A man seeks revenge,
A widow cries,
A death to avenge,
A lawyer that lies,
What shall we do?
We take a stand for what is right,
We look through proof with reason,
We seek to end a fight,
We send him to prison,
guilty, guilty guilty.
Who is the guilty one?
The man in the chair?
Or is it the father of this son?
Or is it the ones that never did care?
execution execution, execution.
Our job is done,
Two men are dead,
Justice has won,
All but one thing is said,
hypocrite, hypocrite, hypocrite.
