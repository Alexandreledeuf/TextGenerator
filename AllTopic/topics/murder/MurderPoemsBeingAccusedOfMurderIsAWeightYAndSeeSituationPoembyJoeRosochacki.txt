Mayra Lizbeth Rosales is accused murder but she is not court bound,
For she weighs a half ton in her body so round.
She is accused of killing her 2 year old nephew,
Eliseo Gozales, Jr. in Edinburg,
No, not the one in Scotland;
the one in Texas.
(But an autopsy revealed that Eliseo's injuries were 'consistent with blunt force trauma' and that Mayra Rosales'
- explanations were inconsistent with the injuries.
The autopsy found multiple skull fractures on the forehead and upper and lower rear parts of Eliseo's skull. The autopsy also found fractures that were estimated to be about a month old, Trevino said.)
The Toddler was dead.
Jaime Rosales, the mother of the toddler,
Should’ve known better but refused to --,
Do So,
My question for is, barring the beating and consequently the death of her son,
“How do you leave 2 year old with bed ridden person that weighs a ½ ton,
that has medical of her own,
And is not physically able to meets the needs of anyone including herself? ”
De-de-de Carlos Mencia would say.
The authorities charged Jaime with child endangerment upon leaving her son,
With her aunt.
So what is?
Mayra is not able to go to court,
and then I say bring court to her,
Prosecutors have to work out how Mayra Rosales will be detained and prosecuted because she weighs nearly 1,000 pounds.
She is unable to fit through a door to leave her home.
As of Thursday evening, she was not in custody.
Bring Jenny Craig in, have subjected to 'Deal a Meal'
Have her eat a meal with vitamins, bread and water
We computers and court recorders to bring depositions to court,
Then why not do the actions in reverse.
Justice shall not be denied for little Elisio,
Maybe the state should put Mayra under a strict diet,
That in a way to help her fit through the court doors on her own,
It’s a sad case but she has to pay the price;
It’s a sad case but society has to pay the price of defending her.
