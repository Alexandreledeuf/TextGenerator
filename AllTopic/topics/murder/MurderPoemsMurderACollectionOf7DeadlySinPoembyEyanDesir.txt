Beware simple mortals
In man's stupidity
And devils trickery
Love, lust, infatuation
Obsessions, Sadness
Intoxication, rage
Confusions, misunderstandings
Loneliness, hatred
Bitterness, revenge
Unfaith-ness, dishonesty
Greed, misfortunes
Jealousy, envy,
Anger, stress, pressure
Have all caused hands
To take away God's creation
And embrace the seed of Satan
Better known as murder.
