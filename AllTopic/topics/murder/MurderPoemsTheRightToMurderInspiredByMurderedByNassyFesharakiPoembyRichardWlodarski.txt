Because I have been robbed
And savagely beaten
Abandoned left to die
Have I right to murder?
Because I have been raped
And physically scarred
Emotionally devoid
Have I right to murder?
Because I have been stripped
Of my virginity
Cheated of childhood
Have I right to murder?
One God has given Life
Our most precious gift
To always be cherished
And never be stolen
