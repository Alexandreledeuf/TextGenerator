She was walking down the narrow street
Shadows were passing by
Afraid of who she might meet
Someone she cannot deny.
She knew that it was coming for her
But she knew that she couldn't do a thing.
And just like that, everything went to a blur
For she was attacked by the murderer.
It shoved her body into a trash bag
Mopped up the blood and grabbed its knife
And wiped its hands with a raging red rag
For it had ended someone's life.
