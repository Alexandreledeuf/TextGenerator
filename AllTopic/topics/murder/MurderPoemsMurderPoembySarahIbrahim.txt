Scene playing in my Head
Every time Anger gets overfed
Screams inside making their way
To the outside…
where they Attack your face, and starts to play
And Hands…Stretching; Reaching your throat
To Grab it tight.
And Stop the Pain your words have brought
To hold the Air from going in…
The heart that you pretend…
Knows the Virtue…knows the Sin
Million times this Scene play
Where Sanity have no place to stay
Cause with Anger and Sadness
Happiness…Is murdered…
And the Mind…dancing in madness.
