As for the innocence;
with which by you it' Is for long, it was so lost;
The by and meek each my possession do not do it again
when we meet again, next week.
which goes and now I mind,
my back in front of he whom wears the black to you, i turn.
With your, by my murder and hers you simply,
thought i would and as for that...
For the other little me,
whom all do not do as me as for her sisters mercy,
because of you I can't ask for mine,
You ask; when you did not of me,
and thinking back you should have what, by now can you think?
I beg pray tell for what, ....As for Their' that which finds my ear;
There is no desire because of how and why 'you for the'...
and where it was I am...I am no more...
their is mercy shown you....at all small; her my/me it once...
inside your moon was always full....now it's empty 'dear'......
...............
Innocence is lost by you and it is gone,
and now we have no soul.
memories built on lies it's better, known.
Simply by your killing, it wont make me whole
I Beg for her mercy, but she can't find my ear
There is no hope at all for you my little evil 'dear'
There is not a man on this planet at whoms feet
I will get down and ever kneel too,
I simply am not that noble of a man.
But a woman that is full of grace, would I pull the
heavens from her sun.
