Five days later, Asifa's body was found.
After seeing her body:
"She had been tortured.
Her legs were broken, "
recalled Ms Naseema, who had rushed to the forest along with her husband to see the body.
"Her nails had turned black
and there were blue and red marks
on her arm and fingers."
Asifa was confined in a local temple
for several days and given sedatives
that kept her unconscious.
She was "raped for days,
tortured and then finally murdered".
She was strangled to death
and then hit on the head
twice with a stone.
Asifa was described as a "chirping bird"
who ran like a "deer".
When they traveled,
she looked after the herd.
"That made her the darling
of the community, "
"She was the centre of our universe."
(I have taken it from the newspapers and from the internet) .
My heart cries for her.
She is an angel among the purest of angels,
in the abode of a God who is beyond all religions.
