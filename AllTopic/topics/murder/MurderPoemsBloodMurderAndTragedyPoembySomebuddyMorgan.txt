With anticipation the drama
That unfolded
Turned and stared into
The devilâ€™s eyes
I felt something or someone
Lurking in the shadows
One does not talk about
The truth or of him
Under the bed of his
Dead daughter
Now shame in fort of
His daughter
There will be NO trouble
The darkness had lent
Me slip away
Lighting of the torches
Danced off crosses of
Pins and needles
Need the cover of darkness
To hind your death
Placed my faith in to a old friend
Lived in harmony with
The good and the bad
Leaving a trail of tears
It too late
Wish I never been born
And burn for eternity
