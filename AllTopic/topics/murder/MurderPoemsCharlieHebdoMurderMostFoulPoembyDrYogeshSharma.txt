Master artist, drawing cartoons,
Risky resistance for liberty of ideas,
For the highest freedom of expression.
Fatwaas, death threats, intimidation,
On hit list, dwelling fired, bombed;
Failed to deter their art and vision.
Wonderful souls, adept art of comedy;
Loved a laugh on themselves,
Abhorred extremism, violence and terror.
In-habituated in safest democratic spaces,
Unmindful of their own security and safety;
Wished a world, free, safe and secure.
Charlie Hebdo will carry on to its voice,
For freedom, free and fear less pen,
Unmindful and un-sacred of death at their doors.
Only souls blessed, can be a cartoonist;
But any un-civilized, insane, barbaric;
Can be a terrorist and slaughterer.
Wrong is the faith, not the men;
Innocents, taught in madarsas and  mosques;
Indoctrinated as murderers most foul.
N.B: This poem is a tribute to the brave and bold journalist and cartoonist of French magazine â€˜Charlie Hebdo' who were massacred by Islamic terrorists in Paris and condom the barbaric massacre of cartoonists.
