Some reporters are being murdered
In Bangladesh recently
And most of the times
Justice is denied or delayed
For lame excuses
Killing a reporter
Is like strangling a brave truthful person
Who is rare and much needed
In any society
Reporters are like mirrors of the world
Murdering them is like
Breaking the mirrors into pieces
That can hurt others
Be careful
O Bangladesh
