after three days, despair has become an unwanted company,
i begin to joke,
i do not choke, i smoke.
its clothes do not fit for my new occasion
its doomed color is irrelevant
my true friends shall detest it
and shall surely vomit it
like a bacteria infected
spaghetti
i like to wear the robe of a happy emerald life,
shiny black shoes that exudes dignity and propriety
there must be extra  pockets to keep some allowances for
the coming excitements, the unexpected joys of living,
i tell despair  to leave me, and it is just as simple at that
and it did.
despair is a bad joke,
in essence just a joke,
it does not please us,
so why should we let it  stay?
