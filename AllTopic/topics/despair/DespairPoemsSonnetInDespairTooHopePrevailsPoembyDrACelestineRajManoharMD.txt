When things beyond my control do occur,
And fortune favors just the evil minds:
When my own people with me don’t concur,
My remnant patience to a halt well grinds.
The world is inimical to my deeds,
And evil seems to win Tho’ just for now;
When God has forgotten my long-felt needs,
My ignominy, I must undergo.
Though Hope may be replaced by Despair, still
The turning point of life for me is near;
Success is nigh and I’ll go for the kill;
My savior keeps me confident sans fear.
Nothing’s achieved when despair rules our hearts;
Impatience only ruins all our arts.
