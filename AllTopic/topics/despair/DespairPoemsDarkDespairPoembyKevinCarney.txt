So sick of it all….
The trust of it all vanished in the wind…
The truth may it be was all a pack of lies…
It was only the path to achieve your ways…
So angry you’ll never know…
So hurt, I can never say…
The words I want to say just can’t come out…
The tears I shed are no longer for you…
You took it to the limit, knowing how gullible I would be.
The fool you played me for, you knew me so well.
You manipulated you smile just at the right moment…
You shed your tears when you thought I would walk away.
So easy it was for you to tell me you cared…
So blind I was to see you were never really there…
The times of the moment, the belief in you…
Led me down your path, to see me be an ass…
I can’t say it was your entire fault…
So much I have myself to blame…
I think you must have sat up in your room…
Alone in the dark
figuring how you could pull my strings…
Listen to me sit here and complain…
I should have opened my eyes to what was around…
I should have been more careful to control my emotions…
Just by chance I learned of what you were planning of me…
So expendable I was to become,
it was all in good time.
A use for me, as you drained the blood from my veins…
Too much it is all for me, a breach of my mind and soul…
Both have been so tainted and so diseased…
I tried and tried to stay here with you…
As I learned it was only a façade created by you…
I looked into the mirror; only to see my dead eyes…
My face so pale and white, you sucked the life out of me…
You sold yourself to me, only it wasn’t what I really saw.
The game you played ever so perfect, such poise and balance…
I saw it all too late, the damage being done…
Leaving me so hurt and so cold, sitting in my dark despair….
