As the waves vanish
At the shores
The new ones rise
and stretch their wings
Am keen to count them
For a while
Though in vain
As the companion abandons
The new one is quick to embrace
Its heavenly bliss
To witness the sight
A magical touch
To forget the rest
Let,
The bygone footprints be bygone
Crumbled Abodes be orphaned
It's an infinite search
On an orbit of canvas
So much to unlearn
So much to unburden
Just in case,
Got queries to pose
Please reserve them for
The desert of despair
