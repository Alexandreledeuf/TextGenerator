Desire and despair
Are two sides
Of the same coin
We dream of stars
And moon
And never reach
Anywhere
Every day we deposit
Our collection
Of despair
In the accounts
Of our mind
But never get
Any interest for it
Yet we try hard to
Increase our deposits
And never try
To admit desire
Is the cause of all despairs
Desire and sufferings - The Buddhist theory.  By watching people Buddha found out that the causes of suffering are craving and desire, and ignorance. The power of these things to cause all suffering is what Buddhists call ''The Second Noble Truth''.
