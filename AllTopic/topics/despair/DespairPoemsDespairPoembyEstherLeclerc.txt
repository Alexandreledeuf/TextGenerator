hope dies hard, it is said
always I agreed
knowing this truth for myself
but
comes a point in the
scheme of things when
the strangling is complete
and so
hope expires because the
subject herself is dead
whether she breathes or
not is beside the point
(7.5.06 - Live on in hope, Little Spirit)
