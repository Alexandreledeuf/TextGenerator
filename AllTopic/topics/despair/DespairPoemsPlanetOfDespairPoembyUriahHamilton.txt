There is certainly
No reason to sadly wander
On these broken lonely streets
Except for the purpose,
The desperate prayer,
Of seeing her again,
My precious friend
Of the alienated boulevards.
It’s been four years
Since we’ve kissed,
I was a small boy then
Who didn’t know
Anything about love
And I know less than ever now.
Romantic heartbreak
Has always been
My only destination,
My crestfallen relationship
To the universe
Is to be a weeping star
Revolving around
A planet of despair.
