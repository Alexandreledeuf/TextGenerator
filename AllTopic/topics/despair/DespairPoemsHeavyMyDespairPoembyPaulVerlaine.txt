Oh, heavy, heavy my despair,
Because, because of One so fair.
My misery knows no allay,
Although my heart has come away.
Although my heart, although my soul,
Have fled the fatal One's control.
My misery knows no allay,
Although my heart has come away.
My heart, the too, too feeling one,
Says to my soul, 'Can it be done,
'Can it be done, too feeling heart,
That we from her shall live apart?'
My soul says to my heart, 'Know I
What this strange pitfall should imply,
'That we, though far from her, are near,
Yea, present, though in exile here?'
