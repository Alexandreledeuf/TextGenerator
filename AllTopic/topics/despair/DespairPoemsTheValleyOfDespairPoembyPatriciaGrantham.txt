Lost and trapped in the valley of nothing but despair
Hands held high for help and grasping nothing but air
Alone and much abandoned no one knows you're there
All have turned their backs and none seems to care
You can choose to stay down and wallow in your sorrow
Or speak words that says there is always a tomorrow
Then you will see the sunshine on a bright new day
Rise up from the valley no matter what they say
When others try their best to keep you burdened down
Rise high above their heads with a smile and not a frown
The life that you want to live is solely up to you
So get up shake off the dust and start your life anew
Despair like a vine can creep back into your life again
Loosen its hold and see the sunshine and not the rain
If you know of someone else whose back is to the ground
Take their hands and lift them up for you was also down
