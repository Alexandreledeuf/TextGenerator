I love the hours of misty morn
When clouds descend and kiss with dew
Lilac, verbena, rose bud and thorn.
In perfumed morn, I think of you.
I love the hours of warm sunlight.
Your beauty is everything I see
And I feel you almost in my sight;
But your spectrum is a mystery.
I love the hour of magic light.
All colors are pleasing to the eye
While I think of you in seraph flight
Aureole, wings, in chromatic sky.
I love the hours of blissful night
And I feel you close in candlelight.
When I fall asleep you hold me tight.
With your love and hope, I greet the light.
