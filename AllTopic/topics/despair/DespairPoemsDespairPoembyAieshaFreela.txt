Despair, pain, sadness, heartache
I’m dying inside
Can anyone hear me?
I’m aching to be loved and heard,
Yet everyone seems so oblivious to it
They treat love as if it were a scrawny little string
Why can’t I just get a single thread from that string?
Why can’t I get anything other than deaf ears to hear me cry out in pain?
Where’s my one-and-only?
When will I be someone’s one-and-only?
Time is ticking, yet its holding still for me,
Imprisoning me in a jail of sadness and no love
I dream of love every night, why can’t these dreams come true?
Can anyone hear me?
I’m dying inside, so emotionally dead
So dead inside
I’m just a shell of what used to be a happy and delightful girl
Can anyone hear me?
I said I’m dying inside!
