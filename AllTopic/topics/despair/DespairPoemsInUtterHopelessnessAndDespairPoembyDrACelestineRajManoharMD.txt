When things have reached the point of no return;
When life's nadir is reached and you can't climb;
When future looks uncertain gloomy, dark;
When bridge to safety is not tread-worthy;
When things have gone beyond the salvage stage;
When odds are pitted heavily against;
When all attempts for success were futile,
When life looks dreary, meaningless to eke;
When truth and facts can't help us anyway;
When stage of verdict frightens and threatens;
When things have gone too far to broker peace;
When dialog was a wasted time and sums;
Then hope still glimmers like a fading star;
Only recourse is pray, plead to the Lord;
For He can do miracles if faith stays,
As nothing's impossible to our God.
