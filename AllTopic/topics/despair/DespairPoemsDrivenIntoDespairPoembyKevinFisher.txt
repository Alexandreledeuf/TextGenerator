Today there will be no killing or blood spilling well none coming from you
I'll kill your friends, parents, and siblings to
I will frame you so your locked up for life
I'll pay the judge so your locked up all alone
You'll be driven right into despair
You shall rot in prison
You'll wither down there
Now you want to vanish into thin air
I'm making you feel as I do
So lonely and bare
Why doesn't anyone care
As I myself is living in despair.
