i still remember being in depth of despair
when i had lost da loved once and those who care
when di mind shutter givin nothin but suffer
nd when evry breath is a gasp for air thinking life is just unfair
i got to hold tied to da ropes of light
wer ill find hope and gain sight
from what i didnt see and try to fight
regainin all dat i had lost
and making up 4 all faults
so i had to hold tight to the ropes of light changin sorrow to delight
givin my self anotherday and looking for a brighter day
ma god its hard to say many are livin it 2 day
