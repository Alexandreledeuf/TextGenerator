I see u everyday in my dream,
'lost' in the shallowy depths of imagination.
i try my best not too scream,
as my heart had known nothin but elation.
i see u taking shade under a tree,
am not sure whether the drops comin out are your tears.
and i wish the one you were waiting for was me,
so that i can come and throw away your fears.
i wish i could come and stand by your side,
and make sure that you will never cry.
not taking care whether i am swept by any tide,
and makin sure that am always there to standing by.
am staring at the moon in the sky so blue,
am feeling that cold mist blowing on my face.
i wish the one next to me was you
right now and right here at this place
i want us to jump and soar the sky,
hand in hand watching the stars go by.
then i want to gift u that big fat moon,
not caring even if its a dumb stupid noon.
my love for u is like a chest made of gold,
i see your eyes ah! they're so bold.
when i think of you my heart's so cold.
these feelings i think i cant fold
i sometimes wish that i could feel your hand,
and before i realise they slip off like sand.
my dreams revolve around a person no matter what i do,
oh my love! that person is you.
this feeling i have never throws me down,
i have lost a heart that was never found.
long back i knew you as a good friend,
i knew you since i dont know when.
i sometimes find words hard to find,
thats probably because you are always on my mind
i think of you each and everyday,
i dont know why we are so far away.
thats probably why i hate god so much,
now you're someone i cant even touch.
the only thing i request you is to wait
i'll come and lift you before its too late
so what i say is when i dream,
i almost see you everywhere.
but when i wake up i often scream,
as i see you nowhere there.
(dedicated to all the people there who have their loved ones far away)
