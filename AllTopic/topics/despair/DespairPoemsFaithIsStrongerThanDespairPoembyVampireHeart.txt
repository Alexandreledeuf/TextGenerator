Despair's cruel fingertips crawl over the heart of my church.
I witness it's demise as my world crumbles.
When all hope is locked up in enemy dungeons, I pray.
With a hand of faith that proudly stood by my side,
I pray, for the weak, to make them stronger,
For the scared, to make them fearsome
And for all that remains pure...
