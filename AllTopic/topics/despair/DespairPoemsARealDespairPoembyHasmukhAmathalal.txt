I shall call on you not out of despair
I will be there when it has gone beyond repair
It wonâ€™t look in niceites and fair
It is definitely blown over  by air
I shall be on your side for all the times
It has been  witnessed  in recent times
You too stood for values and principles
I was always there as staunch disciples
The clouds were gathering storms
The relation was strained and not remaining warm
I could see great difficulty and  danger
It should not have been spoiled with anger
The shadow looming large over our relation
There was going to be big mark in question
How could I thwart off the situation?
It  still needed  some solace or evaluation
I was not expecting to do a wonder
But still I had many questions to ponder
I had lot more to do the good to the friendship
It was to remain in tact as companionship
I could emotionally hide my feeling
It was inwardly pinching and killing
I had earnest try to keep it in tact
This was to be the  centre core in fact
I would love to be on his side
The speculation was very wide
I had nothing to hold back or hide
There might have been some deviation slidr
I shall strive for nice spot
It may not be considered than big blot
We may blow some times cold or hot
The wordy dual is unnecssarily fought
I may still go for fair name
People may have no chance to blame
It will be nice and pefect bond
I always stood for it and was very much fond
