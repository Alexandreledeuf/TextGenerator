Periwinkle blues, vibrant violets blend together creating an atmosphere
only beholding to the most beautiful creatures ever seen on the earths
ball-room of forever living.  A defiance of immortality, living with the masters
of the dark.
Veils of black dust, streamers of grey silk torment while flowing over the
dark, still waters.  Charcoal eyes seen beneath the quite mirrors of the
ocean sink deep.  Climb in if you dare, enter the world of desperate
measures and despair.
Wait! ! !  Suddenly, an enormous hand appears through the  sky and sends
shades of yellows with silver glints shining through.  Ahhh the sound of
Music began to play, while the angles appear, they dance and dance through
the warm  soothing air.
The ocean begins to ripple and the musical notes fall quietly through the
mirrored water taking their places beneath the still waters.  Angels hover
over the window-like bed and the tears of glory fall through that oceanic
bed.  No more heartbreak or fear.   The master of miracles is here.
The invitation to visit the dark and dismal places of the deep, shall not be
accepted after-all.  For this creature is covered by the hand of God and
Shall live in the land of peace and love, and forever be blessed  by the master
Of good who rules and shines from above.
