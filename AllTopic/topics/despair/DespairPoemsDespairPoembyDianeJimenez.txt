I look around me, and I'm in despair.
I glance at each and every corner
I feel so alone.
My wants and dreams for my children
Just one, be not in despair
Yet I see another one of my children
falling thoughts of my deadly despair,
getting nowhere, going nowhere.
This same vicious cycle.
Oh! Lord I must change this hurt that I have given
my children.
Lord! Help, help them to break this inheritance
to not fall upon their children.
Help me! for I'm in despair for happiness and
peace for my children.
They have tried to make a change,
from this grieving and despair, a peace of mind,
a will to make my days upon this grieving world
better.
If I could just make that one difference, I would
live much happier and peaceful.
