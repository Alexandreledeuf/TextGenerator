Like the colors of your cheek in prism
The dew of my love on the colors
Before the Time rings the bell
Is this Time flowing like river
In flow but the rainbow of colors
I steal from your cheek in wonder
Call the people with loud voices
Is it that I show them my love
Nay in secrete shall I burn to ashes
I shall rise like amber in glow
Time is my rival and leaves me not
What of love and longing and from the dark
Hairs of beloved to the color of the cheek
In sensuous love know ye Time
I cherish my love in her manifestation
Glory be to the sculptor for the creation
Is nothing but His reflection
You think with wine I am drunk like Hafiz
Into those eyes I have drowned in love
Behold the scene when my love shall sing
The laments of existence and of the age cruel
Like lark thou sing with melodies of nature
What ails thy heart my love in the end
Let me finish this song eternal to begin anew
Yet another fine evening when the roses in bloom
A goblet of wine, butterflies in friends facing the sun
Setting behind the horizon welcoming the moon
Long nights of separation shall then follow
O heart dear what have thou stored
For devastation so long when shall moments
Turn into centuries but the aroma of her passion
Shall never leave you for a song of despair
