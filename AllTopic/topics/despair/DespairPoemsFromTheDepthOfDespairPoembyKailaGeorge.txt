From the depth of despair
You can only whimper and cry
All the pain you feel drowns your very soul
You become encumbered by all that has been
A nightmare, a hell hole…there's nothing no one can do
You have to live through all this…just to stay alive
The outcome is horrific as you feel rendered by the past
You feel crushed, forsaken, yet your heart still beats so fast
Life is something special never let it go
Make every moment count, from this moment on
