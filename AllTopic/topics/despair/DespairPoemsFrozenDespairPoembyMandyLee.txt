Frozen tears fall to the ground,
covering up this weeping sound.
Of lamenting throughout the land.
Seeping through like grains of sand.
It penertrates our very hearts,
paper thin hit with poison darts.
The darkness grows and closes in,
crying out its resounding win.
Fallen hopes and fallen dreams,
deathly cries and chilling screams.
Not a single soul is spared the pain,
We only wait for the Winter's wane.
