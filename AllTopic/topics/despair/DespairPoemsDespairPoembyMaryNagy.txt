I search the world for answers
to the questions in my mind.
Although, it seems those answers
are the ones I'll never find.
In dark despair I call out.
I scream for help and light.
The source of deep depression
is something I must fight.
I try to ''keep my chin up''
and ''focus on the ball'',
but everytime I take a step
I also take a fall.
For those of us who fight them,
the demons in our head,
we have to force ourselves to sleep
each time we go to bed.
Without my faith in Jesus
and my love of family,
I don't know where I would end up
but I know I wouldn't be free.
