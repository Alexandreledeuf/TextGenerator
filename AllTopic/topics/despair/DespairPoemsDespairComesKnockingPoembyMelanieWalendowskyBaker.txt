When despair comes knocking
There’s no one home
Gone out shopping
And not alone
Despair comes knocking
Every damn week
I try not to care
But he still leaves me weak
But despair comes knocking
Every single day
I keep shooing him off
And sending him away
Despair comes knocking
But what does he want?
Is he here to stay?
Or just here to taunt?
