Being alone as always,
This pain is consuming me,
No one to care for me,
In this empty world alone.
This darkness is all I feel,
All that I can see,
It makes me want to go,
To die and say goodbye,
To everyone that ever cared.
I feel so alone,
Late up at night holding myself,
Well I cry myself to sleep,
Know that no one cares.
A day of despair,
I despise everyday that I am here,
Living this life of mine,
Hurting endlessly,
By people I once thought cared,
Always betrayed,
Feeling a stab in the back,
Friends I once thought cared about me,
But what now.
Turn on me as usual,
I can't trust anyone but myself,
Yes I am alone,
Having to endure this pain,
All I do is suffer anymore.
