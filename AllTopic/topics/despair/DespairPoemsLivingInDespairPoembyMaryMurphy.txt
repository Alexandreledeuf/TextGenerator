No ones knows just how I feel,
Or what pain I hold inside.
Know one knows just how bad,
I wish I could hide.
This person walking towards me,
Must think they know it all,
I said hello but all I got
Was a laugh because I’m tall.
This man behind the counter
He hasn’t stopped to think,
That he doesn’t even know me,
Yet he laughs at how I drink.
This driver with the temper,
Must be really sure,
That he knows my reason,
Of how I got this poor.
The girls with fancy clothes on,
They just laugh and grin.
But do they ever look deeper,
At the person I am within?
The workers at the work site
They joke and joke away,
But if they only understood
Or hear what I had to say.
Maybe they’d speak different,
Maybe they’d feel shame,
Maybe they would realize,
That I too, can feel pain.
Maybe if the world knew me,
Or even seemed to care,
I would not be forced to be this way,
Living in despair.
