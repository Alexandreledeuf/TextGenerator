The night rain sing the song
To benumb my soul all along.
Grief breaks heart's fence
Over the hills of silence
The song of despair!
Floats everywhere in air
The song of despair
Floats everywhere;
Till the depth of heart's creek
To cascade tears through the cheek.
One's heart becomes stone-dead
When their most loved left its stead.
Eyes then lost fore'er its shine,
Nothing will follow there but a shadow;
The only crony I've to say as mine
To walk with me in this despair-meadow.
Once in a medow of love I walked
With my lover and we stalked
Holding her hand in my wrist,
Holding my hand around her waist.
We woven the wings of dreams
And built castles on streams
Life was an ever opened book
Where the moments of love we took,
To draw the most beautiful pictures on its pages
As our hearts were one as a land with no rages
Everytime the hands of destiny write its word
The golden pages of life was engulfed by rust
That made the glitter of love blurred,
Eyes scatter the seeds of despair in dust
No one knows what's destiny,
Until they feel what's despair!
