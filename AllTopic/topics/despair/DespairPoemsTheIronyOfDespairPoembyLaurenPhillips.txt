the silence breaks the noise;
dark and fearful
as shadows consume the light
and the sun that shown with radiance;
bright and guiding
has been swallowed by the night
tears stream from eyes;
sad and lonely
she reaches for the gun
screams are muted for the silence;
long and hopeless
made her decide her life was done
the single bullet in hand;
cold and silver
thinking the choice she's making is right
looking for the second bullet;
hurriedly and desperate
she thinks for a second: she never thought she might...
placing the pistol at her neck;
scared and shaking
soon of her life there would be none
the gun shot breaks the silence;
loud and echoing
with this, out from behind a cloud peeks the sun.
