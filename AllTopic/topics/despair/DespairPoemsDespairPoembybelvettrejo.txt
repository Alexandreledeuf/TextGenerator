Despair outloud
Despair and fear
Its all despair when noone hears
My soul is screaching
It mouns to you
Its like a whisper, its like a flute
The midnight fence, that holds me back
It aches my heart with metal bars
Despair is all i know
Despair its lonely yet its my home
Despair is simple, it holds 7 words
Despair
come join me
We wont die alone
