Distraught
That's what I am
Why does the world
have to be like this?
Why can't things ever
work out for me?
Crying
That's what I'm doing
Crying out tears that drag out
my sadness, my pain, my confusion
Stop
That's what I want to do
Cease feeling the wrongs of the world
All weighing down on me
Until I feel I am crushed
How?
How can I forget the sadness?
How can I stop the pain?
How can I heal these scars
left on my heart?
Never
Never will I be able to rid my life
of all it's troubles
Never can I heal my heart
The wounds may heal
But the scars will remain
Escape
That's what I must do
But where?
Where is there a place safe from all the pain,
all the sadness, the confusion
I must go
I will never survive another day like this
Now
I must be rid of this
It's eating away at my insides
It's slowly causing me to fade
I'm growing weaker, and weaker
The sadness, the pain, the confusion
Despair
That's what this is
I am distraught and in despair
and I can never be rid of it
It is destroying me
Slowly, but surely
I am fading
