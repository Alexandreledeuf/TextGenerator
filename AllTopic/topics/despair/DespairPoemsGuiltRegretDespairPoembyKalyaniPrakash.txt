Dying here....inch by inch.....
A sense of guilt has struck me somewhere
Whereas I have done no wrong to feel so.....
Hdidng in these shadows of regret and scare
Feels like I do not exist....
A lost friendship is hard to bare.....
But replaced with a kind of hope and sense that- she will tell 'Why do you regret? It is I who has done wrong not you.'
But replaced with a kind of hope and sense that she will realise the deep truth beneath all these lies.......
At the present, I am dying here....inch by inch......
