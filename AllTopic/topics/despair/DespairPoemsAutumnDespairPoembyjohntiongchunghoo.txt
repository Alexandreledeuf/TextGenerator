we say we will
spend some time
for the season
take a walk in
the autumn groove
enjoy the trees
the leaves and
the soft rustle
at our feet
that gently bids
goodbye to another
season of gold and amber
we never let it
dig our heart
to catch a leaf or two
they fall, resigned
to the fact that
we will never
have time
trail the last wind
and listlessly
to the ground
like jilted lovers
soon the snow will
bury them and our wish
to explore the season
Spring will see us
caught up with another year
like fish in a net with the water
just inches away
