I watch the river flowing down towards the deep blue sea,
At the end of its winding path I know you wait for me,
Like the mountains and the valleys and the sun up in the sky,
My love for you will shine eternally and never die.
For the river is the spirit that puts life into my heart,
And tells me you are with me all the times we are apart,
For its beauty and its splendour, its wonder and its grace,
Will be with me forever on this journey that I face.
Like the colours of the sunrise and the coming of the spring,
I gaze upon this paradise and hear the birds that sing,
So sweetly in the treetops while I know that far away,
My home is where my heart lies where I long to be this day.
For the river keeps on flowing and is acting as my guide,
And leads me ever onward to the place I shall abide,
Hope shall live eternally and never will be gone,
I know that while this river flows I'll always carry on.
I pray that God will steer me through the rocks that lay ahead,
And all the troubled water to a calmer place instead,
Where there is only sunshine and a sky so clear and blue,
I know the path I follow now will lead me back to you.
For the river is the reason why I need you evermore,
It heads towards the place I knew so many years before,
And although things may have changed I won't regret I came,
For you are all I care for and I hope you feel the same.
