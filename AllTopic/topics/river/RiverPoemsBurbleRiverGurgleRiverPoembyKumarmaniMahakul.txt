Carrying gentle peace and bliss
Gifted by God for selflessness,
Love you carry for infinite times,
Lovely river you burble, burble.
For uniting with a sea so far,
You travel distance of perception,
Breaking up into turbulence in joy,
You give continuous murmuring noise.
Gurgling sound we hear near you,
Your running water makes bubbling,
This hollow bubbling sound amazes,
We know in true love you gurgle.
You burble and gurgle and flow,
River you flow towards sea to unite,
Carry us in your flow towards God,
We are eager to meet father of heaven.
