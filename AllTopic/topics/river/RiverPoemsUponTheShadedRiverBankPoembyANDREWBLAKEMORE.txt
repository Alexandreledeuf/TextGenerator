Upon the shaded river bank
Where willows weep on water's edge,
And drape the sympathetic shore
That to my heart shall yield,
Some comfort as I sit and rest
And gaze across the surface calm
A mirror of the August sky
And pray my wounds be healed.
I listen as the birds do sing
Upon the boughs that gently move,
Within the breeze that softly calls
Her sweet name unto me,
A breath so warm with tender touch
That melts the chill of lonely days,
But yet I know she'll never come
To end my misery.
Upon the shaded river bank
My only thoughts to be with her,
And so these tears shall never dry
Until I find relief,
The graceful swan who swims alone
And so forlornly bows her head,
As she does search in vain for love
I too now share her grief.
