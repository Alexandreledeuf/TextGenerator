The river does not walk on its
journey struggling to get
to its destination because
it takes its step in a direction
that has been destined for it.
So my brother, like the river
you would continue to flow
in this life without any struggle
till you reach wherever you want
to end this journey of yours.
Did you ever see the tree
attempting to end where its
height should end on its journey
towards the blue skies above?
That is the way you would grow
in life as nothing would cut
short whatever height you
wish to attain in life, my brother.
