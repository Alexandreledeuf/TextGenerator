Arrows! Against these chain mail
is effective to repel the sharpness
of their flighted points.
Even hardened bullets, blunt in their intent,
against them an armoured vest
I may procure
to protect my soft heartâ€™s flesh.
And slanders of my character,
thrown with spiteful vigour
across a heated, hot debate.
Well the courts may give a cool defence
to protect me from their hate.
But what defence have I against your love?
I steal myself from you with,
self conceit or hate or
even despising of your gentle care
which you often give and only for
care itself; its sake, not for any else.
I try to block you out of mind
without a thought of any kind
and with no kindness in my mind.
But straight to my heart you fly
circumventing all my barriers in mind
which are without effect,
my intellect you do most easily,
go round..
Love! Why do I fear you so?
Because I know that without
your sweet presence
my soul will by nothing but a dryness
as a river bed without the rain
by which it is filled and fed.
And even when I become as ice
you send the gentle snow
to blanket me with purity
because that is all you ever see;
or saw; in me.
No matter what I hold in my armoury
I have no defence against your Love
In your arms I live and without you
I surely am just the living; dead.
Empty like a dried up river bed,
waiting for your rain to bring life
and set me free to flow
with your Love, full and fulfilling me.
