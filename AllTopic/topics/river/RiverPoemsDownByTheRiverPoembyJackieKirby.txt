Down by the river we did go
hand in hand in a lovers
hold
Momma and daddy said
this is a love that can not grow
and he must go
But momma an daddy i love him so.
you stay with him then you must go
. don't make
me chose for i love you too
Down by the river we did go hand
in hand in a lovers hold
Momma and daddy you dont know,
His love for me is pure as gold
Theres something you two
must know.
Down by the river we did go hand
in hand in a lover hold
Raining so hard we could hardly see
We slow danced by the rivers edge
He said no other could love you like i
Then i slipped an fell and the river
took me away
I fought the river but the river won
Then a bright light shined
Saw an angel reaching for me
Momma an daddy you dont know
When my eyes open this is what i seen
.Had been pulled
from river laid me upon the shore
Blanket of white feathers were
keeping me warm
As he stood with tear filled eyes
A bright light shine
And upond his back were angel wings
.He said
God sent me here to love you
Momma and daddy you dont know.
My choice is with him now i go
For oneday i'll have my own angel wings
And will never let him go.
Momma and daddy you dont know
Down
by the river we did go hand in hand
in a lovers hold
down by the river
we did go
