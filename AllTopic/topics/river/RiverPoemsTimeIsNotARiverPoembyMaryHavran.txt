Time is not a river
Nor a ticking clock
Nor an hourglass
We cannot save time
We cannot spend time
We cannot borrow time
We cannot buy time
We cannot cheat time
Time is not a gift
Time is not our friend
Nor our enemy
Time is not on our side
Time is not ours in any sense
Save for the single second
That holds our full attention
Then slips forever beyond grasp
