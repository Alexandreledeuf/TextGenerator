I have to go back
to long ago
back accross
misty rivers memories
of so
Past lives to dawn
on me so the way
to live from the
blood
All do know cowling towns
folk shall see into there
souls
With a whisper a sound
misty rooms sweet scent
maidend gown
From he no protection
could so be found
very survive
Yon lore of past cought
up in the mythes
none may so pass
For me to live some
had to die thats why its
Called
The River Of Blood
