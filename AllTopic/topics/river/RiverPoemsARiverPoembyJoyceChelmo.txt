Canâ€™t stop looking at your picture,
hypnotized.
Your beauty a blaze from within.
The attraction would
not be there if it were not
for the essence you offer.
A cool drink for a parched soul.
A lake gathering fresh waters
of wisdom
from the flow of your river.
Mesmerized, captured, infatuated.
I want to drink you,
because,
a lake refuses no river.
