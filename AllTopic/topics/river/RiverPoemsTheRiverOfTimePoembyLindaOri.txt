The river of time keeps on flowing
O'er wishes and dreams gone unknown,
The worst thing is wanting and knowing
Endearments that never were shown;
Tomorrow is better than never
To speak all those words in your heart,
Don't hold them inside you forever -
Perhaps it's a good time to start
By saying 'I love you' more often,
Let everyone know that you care,
You simply can't take it for granted
And hope they're already aware;
Three little words - you can do it!
Don't let them get stuck deep inside,
Just say them out loud, nothing to it -
Speak up!  There's no reason to hide;
That river of time keeps on flowing
The present turns into the past -
Your light should be shared while it's glowing,
So love like today is your last.
