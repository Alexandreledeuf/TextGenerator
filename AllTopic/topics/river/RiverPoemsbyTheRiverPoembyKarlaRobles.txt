This is one of my wirdest dreams
Walking by the river thinking things out,
I see a girl crying and one with a pout.
As I draw closer they both disapear
And mysteriously I feel tears
I wonder what can this mean
The next day I dream the same
Only this time they were the ones that came
But this time the one that was crying says 'why do you treat him so bad? '
Then I understood-the child in me wanted me to treat life the way it should and to enjoy it creatively!
