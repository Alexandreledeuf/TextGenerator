Where'er the sweetest river flows
I long that land to be my home,
Where I shall walk with my true love
Amongst the hills of green,
And there above the sun will shine
Within the skies of deepest blue,
And I shall never leave that place
Of beauty so serene.
Where we shall walk together through
The finest meadows hand in hand,
Then stop to pick some daisies as
We rest beneath a tree,
And listen to the birds that sing
Within the boughs that cast their shade,
And there we'll stay till evening falls
And kiss so tenderly.
We'll stop to watch the stars appear
To share the silence of the night,
Then make a wish for love to last
So we shall never part,
We'll see the dawn then rise again
Above the hills that stand before,
To light the way for us to go
And joy shall fill my heart.
Where'er the sweetest river flows
With waters pure I'll drink for thee,
Where blossom forms and flowers bloom
And spring shall never end,
Each day we live so filled with joy
But I know soon I shall awake,
Till then I'll rest within my dreams
With you my precious friend.
