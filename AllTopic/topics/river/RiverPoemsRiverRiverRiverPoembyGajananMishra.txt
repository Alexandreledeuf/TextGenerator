What do you mean by river?
Is it only mere water?
Is it flood water or dry river?
River, I know, my life my notion
The lifelines of my civilization.
River goes on long journey towards the sea
I go on long journey through this body towards my Master, Almighty.
My life is the purest life, see, watch, observe
My life is unique, highly developed
Fresh air fresh mind fresh water fresh thought
I am in need to flow smoothly to my Master, Almighty.
Rainy and summer all experienced by the river
O my dear, I experienced my sadness and happiness
And care not and I flow with the time
To receive His grace here.
Eighty four lakhs of Yonis or births I have crossed
And reached so far at this human life's entrance gate
Of my Master and I have listened  what He told me
At the outer of my life come on come on I am here I am here
Telling me river at the ocean's outer and in the deep
Deep ocean you may say milk-ocean You are my Master, my dear
Come on come on You are telling me and I am
Flowing with pleasure with the time-river.
