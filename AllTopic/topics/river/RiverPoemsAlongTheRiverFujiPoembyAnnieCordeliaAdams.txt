along the river fuji
bright, where a mountain
stands before me tall
one hundred people gather
on the other side for qingming
but I lean against a cherry tree
so that I can fall asleep
like I used to in the spring
against broken cattle fences
i would awake at dusk
of the next day-finally rested,
when everything else was asleep
then the wild pink cherry tree
would breath its breath of fragrance
and my world would change
