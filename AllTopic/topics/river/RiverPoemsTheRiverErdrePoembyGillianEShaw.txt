Then run along the riverside
upon a time a French King's pride
viewed vast breadth and gentle ripples;
glitter, glisten, glow and twinkle.
Inhale the bird infested air
of clearer blue and high up there
free to soar the highest heights
a brighter day as one takes flight.
The heron builds a mighty nest
and seagulls plague us overhead!
Wild yellow iris fill the banks,
in spring, the Lord is given thanks.
As river flows around the bend
perfection reflected; sunlight sends
and man created paint and brush
to capture the views colorful, lush.
Painted river boats and barges,
sailing craft of varied sizes
and floating buss' run on time;
canoe or pleasure where we may dine.
So run, run by the riverside
upon a time a French King's pride.
Cycle paths and dogs who linger.
Glisten, glitter, row the river.
For Egal Bohen.
