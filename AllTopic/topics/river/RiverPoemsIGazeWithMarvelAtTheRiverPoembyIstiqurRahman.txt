By the river I stand:
Waves amass together
Will ease;
Along the river banks sand
With little ripples
As they please.
How fascinating these
Waves really tease!
Bestowing upon me a quiet
Sense of peace.
As the tension in my
Head release.
Watching with a shiver,
I GAZE WITH MARVEL AT THE
RIVER.
For, I am an avaid believer.
More than life it delivers.
The feeling is mutual.
The river signifies
Something spritual;
Right down below it is
Factual.
Life form continues to
Mature and grow.
And whilst the river flows.
Who knows
That life holds for us tomorrow.
