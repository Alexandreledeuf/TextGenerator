blood rushing within
keeps my cold heart beating
keeps me living
Blood rushing out of me
Keeps the real pain at bay
Takes over all other thoughts
Gives me a focus
Gives me control
Blood upon the floor
Seeping towards the door
A river of past pain
A river of tears I’ve shed
A river of  tears I’ve bleed
A river to die by
