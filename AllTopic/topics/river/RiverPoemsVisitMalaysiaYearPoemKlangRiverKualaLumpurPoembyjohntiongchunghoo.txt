i come here to look
for the hearts of the city
and thank God find
them in your frantic frantic  rush
out to the Straits of Malacca
spilling joy and laughter
the way spices and tin were
sailed out from here years ago
i could hear the riotious tinkling
sounds you chime so splendidly
from below the bridge between the
Central Market and the Dayubumi
that looms so perfectly up into sky
the rain has stopped, and your
rush is fast, swift,  reeling,
waves spiralling and swaming
onto those at the fore, over zealous
children hurrying out to field
to have their evening game
i stay put to savour all
the cheers and good vibes
your song is spreading
to all of us, the song that says
all the way from the heart of the Peninusla
'have fun, have fun, have fun  just have fun.'
Yes, yes, Klang River, i will have fun,
just have fun, come rain or shine
the way you share yours
all around, day and night
night and day, all the way
out to the golden straits
