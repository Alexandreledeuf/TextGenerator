Today I met a woman
Who died four years ago
She spoke to me for hours
As though she knew my soul
She took me by the hand
Led me along a stream
Where trout swam in sparkling waters
Under clear crystalline skies
This woman shared the magic
Of years of circumspect living
And artfully crafted writing
Precisely gem set words
She dwells now in brightness
I could but pause and glimpse
Through my own dark glass
Her poems the only light
In memory of Kathleen Raine
