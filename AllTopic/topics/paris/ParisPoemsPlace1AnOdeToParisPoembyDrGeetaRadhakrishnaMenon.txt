Paris! O Paris!
Paradise of grand monuments!
Prized wonder -The Eiffel tower,
Patrons of art and artistes,
Pavilions of patisserie
Perennial city of joy!
Paintings that cast a spell at the Louvre,
Paintings that make an impression at Musee d Orsay,
Paintings that spell magic of Monet, Manet and Degas,
Paintings that stir your emotion like the
Picture perfect of Vincent van Gogh -A
Penchant for the Impressionists!
Beckoning Bridges along the Seine River,
Bridge Royal built by Sun King Louis XIV,
Bridge Concorde made with stones of Bastille,
Bridge Alexandre III - a Franco-Russian alliance,
Bridge Alma with the popular sculpture of â€˜le zouave'
Bridge Corrousel leading towards the Tuilerie gardens!
A walk in the Tuilerie garden,
A gleeful glide amongst the picturesque greens,
Along the majestic speaking trees,
A profusion of colourful blooms,
A park that projects elegance
A serene garden of love and loveliness!
Terrible! Horrible!
Terrorism striking with its ugly jaws
Tearing apart a nation that symbolized style
Tentacles spreading their venomous stings
Tears flowing into an ocean of sorrow
Tender hearts breaking into thousand pieces!
Why did the seed of terrorism get sown?
Why should the innocent citizens die?
Why should a charming city be torn to pieces?
Why this barbaric act of blood shed?
Why? Cannot man live in peace?
Why? Cannot humans love each other?
