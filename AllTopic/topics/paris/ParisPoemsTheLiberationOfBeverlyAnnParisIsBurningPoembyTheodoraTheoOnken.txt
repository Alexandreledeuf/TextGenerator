Woe to cages and their bars- -
Lock downs - so subdued...
Thickened air - closing in
Lack of freedom in years accrued;
Longings, yes, deepest longings
For the natural of mating calls...
Her desire - an ever burning fire
Elevated hopes - with way too many falls;
Too many WRONG turns - bent on desire! !
Too much numb when needed to protect...
A fearless soul-her mistakes have taken their toll
It really is:  'Cause & Affect';
Here's to someday for Beverly Ann...
Here's to Baccus and celebration's grand- -
Here's to revelry without 'normal conscience'
Here's to liberation's - mighty hand;
Someday will become her free day...
As she sails through her appetites of long desires
Lusting for nearly everything in the world...
Someday, come what may, comes a quenching of her blazing fire;
