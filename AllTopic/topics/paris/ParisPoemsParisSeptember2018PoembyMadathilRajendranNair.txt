City of contrasts and perspectives
as the guide describes,
one is baffled where to begin:
Eiffel's rusty looks scaling into evanescent skies
eerie, metaphysical,
existential angst of Sartre and the like
at Le Caf√© de Flore in Saint-Germain-Des-Pres,
imposing spiritual marvel of Notre Dame De Paris,
the city's celebrated night life,
Lido which I didn't see
(never visit Paris with family) ,
the pantheon of naked masculinity
at the Louvre which boasts
of Roman research into true human form
(true indeed they were in trimming to size
male genitalia to miniscule inches,
the exaggerated measure of which
had always bloated the male ego
into escapades and misadventures
unabashedly christened as world history) ,
magnificent Champs Elysees hooding up at the grand Arc de Triomphe
where an unbending De Gaulle was fictioned to have stooped
in time to save his head from Jackal's speeding bullet
or at last the great River Seine
on the banks of which
men, women and children stand
like windmills raising their arms
waving at visitors onboard midstream
as though to aliens in close encounter
