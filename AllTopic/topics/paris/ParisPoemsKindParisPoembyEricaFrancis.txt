Kind Paris
under my feet.
The clack of heels
on a cobblestone walk
along the river
encompassed with concepts
from centuries of artists.
The streets,
they sing,
with the accordian
and accoustic.
Kind Paris
under my feet
and my theatrical
and melodic tapping
of heels on wet cobblestones.
