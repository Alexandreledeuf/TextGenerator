Ms.Paris what is Paris?
Eiffel Towers beauty,
Disneyland's adventure,
Historically religious.
Its all step by step to your
destination,
Only 1 street lamp,
Owls Go starring curiously.
A long way in history,
A lot for a pray to God Almighty.
Really amazing Sacre Coeur,
and Notre Dame church.
Ms.Paris is it really Paris?
