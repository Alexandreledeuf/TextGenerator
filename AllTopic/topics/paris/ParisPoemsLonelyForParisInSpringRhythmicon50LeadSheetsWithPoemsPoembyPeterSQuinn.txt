Lonely for Paris in spring
All is so faraway to reach,
A heart for joy could sing
What memories should teach;
Eyes are wide in clearing blue
All is such a joy to glide,
It's always up to me and you
What gets soft or amplified.
Be here and become strong
All has its wandering ways,
Have an opportunity get along
Make the best of all the days;
Ripe your feelings and touch
Nothing else is more of hope,
We have everything inasmuch
As we work things out and cope.
The days begin in nothingness
With the cold pleasure at first,
Then there might be a new fresh
A moment of thought we thirst;
A day is asleep for awhile
And then there's some awaken,
Hard in a lost hour to defile
When a mind's occupied or taken.
