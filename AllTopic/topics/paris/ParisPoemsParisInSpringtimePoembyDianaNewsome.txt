We make plans
setting them in motion
picking them
as if apples from a tree
ripe, sweet apples...
Paris in Springtime
yes, that is what we talked about
unfolding our dreams
in places and time
under a foreign sky
getting lost
in the soul of her city streets
stringing together hands
unwrapping our moments
in gloamings gaze
lounging at a local cafe
nibbling on edibles
laughing, talking
blanketing each other
in thought
garnishing our love
in contentment
filling up
once empty spaces
lying together between silky sheets...
It is you
I know it now
a resounding yes,
you were right all along
I have found you in the rhythms of my heart.
