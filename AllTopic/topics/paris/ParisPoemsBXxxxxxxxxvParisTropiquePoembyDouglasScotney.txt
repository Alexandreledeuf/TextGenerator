Energized
by the scent of mesmerized women of a south sea shore,
men went to that shore
and mesmerized the women the more.
They emitted more scent,
energizing the men the more,
and drawing more and more men to the shore.
Some took their scent to France,
where their mastery at erotics
made Paris
northern limit
and capital city
of the Tropics.
