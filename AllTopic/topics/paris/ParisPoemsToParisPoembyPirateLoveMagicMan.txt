I want to look into her dreamy eyes, But she turns them away and my heart sighs. I want to hold her hand and intertwine our fingures, But my
ennocent youthful sweat lingures.I want to embrace her in my arms to cuddle, But when I raise them there is no mass, no muscle.I want to feel
her soft lips in a sweet pashoinet kiss, But mine turn into a dry desert abyss.Then it is time for our day to end along with my first date gidder,
but I carry her sent with me to remember.
