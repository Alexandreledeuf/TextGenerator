Just written media August 2011.
Recently last July I was invited by a good friend to come to Paris.
When still living in the tropics I loved to study Beaux Arts in Paris, but....since I was the only girl (be noted: my big bro was the only boy....LOL...) , my mom forbade me, I may not study in Heidelberg either! Since then Paris had become its home in my head, I really enjoyed my very first visit to Paris, I was really very excited...and last July I was back again in Paris, this time I was invited....all previous times I invited myself...
Paris was my first Love
so excited for the first time
I thank God above, my love
have met Paris again and a good rhyme
Paris was my first Love
but not my last
I forget sometimes the Present
but I'll never do that with the Past
