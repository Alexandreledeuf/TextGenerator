Somewhere, always.........
A child is born and cries out loud.
I exist!
A child is adopted and feels her first bed
I am home!
A young girl befriends the new girl in school
I am here!
A young boy on a cloud just had his first kiss
I am in heaven!
A young groom takes his lovely bride by the hand
I am yours!
A father lifts his daughter high over head.
I am flying!
A mother reads to her son in bed at night.
I am safe!
A Grandmother teaches her grandchild confidence.
I am bright!
A Grandfather shows his grandchild how to fish.
I am special!
A wife toasts her sleepy husband a New Years Wish
I am happy!
A husband rubs her tired shoulders in appreciation
I am lucky!
A poet types away knowing good people will prevail
I am certain
A quiet peace in knowing that at this very moment
There is love.
Keep the faith.........
