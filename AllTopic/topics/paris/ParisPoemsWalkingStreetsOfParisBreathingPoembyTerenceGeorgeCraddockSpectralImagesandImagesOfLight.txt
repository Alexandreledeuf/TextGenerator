she wrote
'Happiness is....
Walking the streets
of Paris & breathing
in the magical scents
of the boulangeries
on the winter air.'
I replied
'Happiness is....
Walking in the rain
at sunrise sunset noontime
anytime rain snow or shine
when love two paired hearts
entwines in love time divine.'
