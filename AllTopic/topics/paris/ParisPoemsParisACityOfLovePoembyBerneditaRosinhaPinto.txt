Under that Eiffel tower they stood
re-affirming their love for each other,
after marriage vows and wedding bells
by the Arc de Troimphe they drove,
by the church of  Notre Dame de Paris
promises they made again
that never ever would they separate;
friends watched them kiss, sing and dance
as wine glasses got re-filled,
new dawn, new world awaited them
as tomorrows would take them
thro' all the avenues of love and life
in that city called Paris -
a city full of love and life
where joie de vivre never ceases;
how could they expect to part
by death, by cruel fate
when a bomb exploded
and their hearts forgot to beat.
And as they stopped breathing
their dreams turned into flowers
that friends placed upon their bodies;
how could they die
in that street, in that cafe,
in their own city
where they laughed with friends
and loved each other more
over a coffee, over a quarrel
yet they went home holding hands,
remembering Paris was their city
a city of love and life
and endless joie de vivre.
