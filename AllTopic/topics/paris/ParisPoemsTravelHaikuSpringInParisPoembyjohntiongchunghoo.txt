Paris spring
street by street we explore
the city like a flower
Paris spring
slowly but surely the city
blooms in us
Paris spring
foot by foot
we explore the city
Eiffel Tower spring
the city lights up
our dreams
Eiffel Tower spring
the city spreads out
like our dreams
They say springtime in Paris is the stuff of songs, daydreams, and romance novels. And there is a heavy dose of truth to that. Cruise the Seine River, admire art at the Louvre and the Musée d'Orsay, and see the quintessential Parisian sights of the Arc de Triomphe and Notre Dame. Enjoy a good book and coffee at a café on the Champs-Elysées, have a picnic of fresh bread and cheese in the Tuileries Garden, or take in a dinner show at The Moulin Rouge. Cap off your trip with an evening ascent up the Eiffel Tower to witness the City of Lights in full glory.
