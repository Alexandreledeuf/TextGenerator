My mother was much sensitive to cleanliness,
She was fond of perfumes and fragrant flowers,
She was famous for her kindness,
And hard works, in the suns and showers
She loved all children, particularly her own,
She was fond of sweets and ice-creams,
She was married at an age, not much grown,
She remained a girl with teen aged dreams.
She liked melodies and fine arts,
She was fond of fictions and movies in the hall,
Knitting, stitching and cooking, her crafts.
My father a contrast to her at all.
After working whole day, since early morning,
Restless lady took some rest mid day,
A shower and change of dress, in the evening,
The small blue bottle of perfume, for the tired clay!
(I still feel fragrance of “Evening in Paris”, a perfume in a small blue bottle)
