It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
Nobody knows where my 50 cent has gone
But I danced left and right the same time
Why was he holding his mike
When the part is to be mine
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
Then all my 50 Cent Jams kept people dancing all night
But leave me alone for a while
'Til 50 cent is dancing with me
I've got no reason to smile
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
50 cent and his boys just walked thru the door
Like a King and his page
Oh what a Super Bowl surprise
When he said “Get the F%#k off of my stage”
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
Oh-oh-oh It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to.....
