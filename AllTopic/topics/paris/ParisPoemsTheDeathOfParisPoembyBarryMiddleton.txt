Because he coveted beauty
above wisdom or power,
death would be his destiny.
Wisdom may have saved him.
Yet he deceived himself
to believe a mortal man,
could possess such loveliness,
even though he was a prince.
The fairest maiden of all,
the daughter of the Swan,
was wed to a Greek King,
but she did not love him.
Still in alliances of death,
armies swore protection
of their honored Queen,
and the honor of the King.
Yet goddesses conspired,
and Eros fired love's arrow
ensuring Helen's passion.
Thus the Prince was doomed.
Paris would die for love,
for abduction of the Queen
brought war and retribution,
and Troy was razed to dust.
