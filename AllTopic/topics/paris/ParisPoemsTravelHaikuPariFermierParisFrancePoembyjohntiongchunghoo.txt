Pari Fermier
like the countries they are from
cheese in all shapes and sizes
Pari Fermier
the artist shops for a farmer
to work as model
Pari Fermier
he says he is only interested
in their cheese
Pari Fermier
when talks about food ring
louder than art
The finest of farmers markets, the Pari Fermier brings together up to 200 independent, small-scale producers six times a year for four days, in or around Paris. Pick up goodies like cider from Normandy, spice cake from Languedoc-Roussillon, honey from the Auvergne, walnuts from the PÃ©rigord, and, of course, fine cheeses from all over the country, and watch chef demonstrations with exhibitors' ingredients during the next fair, October 17-20.
