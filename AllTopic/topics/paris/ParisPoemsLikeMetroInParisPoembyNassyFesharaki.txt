Like Metro in Paris
As I did in metro
in Paris, years ago
leaning to the side-wall
Study and recall
the shoes and
the legs and, the skirts
trousers and the canes
to scarves
hats and shawls
pull-over, to blouse
overcoat, tightly packed
open neck, cleavage
jewellery with necklace
and their hairs with styles
What is but attraction
beauty, in actions
reactions?
People are flowers
in greatest garden.
