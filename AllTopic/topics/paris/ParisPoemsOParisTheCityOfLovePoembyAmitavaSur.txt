O’ my loving Paris, the City of Love
The cultural center, whom I adore and endear.
A city with art and abundance of culture
Where ever you look around will find amazing sculpture.
This city is ornamented and enriched with immortal write
A city, with treasures of famous paintings with delight.
Humming with legendary poems and play writes
Being vibrant with amazing dance, music and play.
Renowned for it’s stunning perfume and dresses
With classic Literature and Art works to name.
A city with Maupassant, Rodin and Dumas
Having Moulin Rouge, Louvre and
The Memorable Eiffel Tower with millions' love.
That city had bled with innocents’ blood
With tyrants’ and extremists’ inhuman fire.
Their beastly approach towards ruining civilization
With mindless savagery in killing innocents
Will beget them what, they even don’t know
But they do these satanic acts, ruining our civilization!
Mean extremism can never win at last
Good senses will surely prevail upon the brutal evils.
