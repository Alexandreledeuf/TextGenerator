I know this Girl Doris
She lives in Paris
Doris asked me to come for a visit
So I got on a bus and did it,
Went to Paris
saw lovely Doris
And all the sites
plus the night lights
I was tired, and I went to the Hilton
that is in Paris, after I left Doris
Now in my room thinking about the day
' I did Paris', I suppose I can say......
