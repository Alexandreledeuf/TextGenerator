There it was finally,
standing tall, such a work of excellence
Another man's work of art,
turning man into love birds that gather but in all seasons
Just to admire the beauty..
To confess, propose, to cherish love
This was the Eiffel Tower.
The warmth of the love radiating from all
the people made the snow a decor.
'Tu es belle', i said as i handed you a rose
you lit up more than the stars themselves.
The acute smile together with your beautiful eyes,
complimenting that funny nose.
I skip a beat as i fall in love once again.
A gentle kiss on your forehead while you are
at your most vulnerable self..
Coy, anxious, happy, excited...that chubby baby face
'Je t'aime plus chaque jour', as i closed the case..
Sadly i wake up and its a broken movie
and this was just a scene.
Reality is actually far from how everything seems..
We are worlds apart, yet i still dream
but sad truth remains, we shall never have Paris.
