This is no fiction, but reality. This was God's miracle again for me,
few hours hereafter occurred the bombings in Paris. We? Already at the Orly Airport, awaiting the plane to Home....With love, Sylvia.
PARIS after the 12th of November?
No one to blame
the Eiffel Tower?
Never more the same,
departure some hours later, no resemblance
those slight difference: terror in ignorance
forced to stay in Paris forever
could never see again your homeland, remember?
no dreams anymore, constant nightmares
but....WHO....yes! WHO cares? !
you would never know, was it a curse or a bliss,
oddly enough, I informed you now all about this.
Now Paris for you is still a greatest bliss
you've never been in Paris before
we did enjoy, quarrelled and enjoyed more
for you and I Paris was the walhalla
our joy and happiness we never measure, and blah-blah-bla
God showed us the perfect view
from dusk till again the morning dew
to treasure and respect His Mighty Impact
that life He showed you, enjoy it and be correct!
please, honour His presence
be careful and love thy neighbours in mine absence....
