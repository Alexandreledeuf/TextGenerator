I  cant pretend that the long week end
That I spent in gay Parie
Though `twas great  left me in a state
Of very low degree.
The Mona Lisa smiled at me
And I smiled back at her
Went to Montmartre to study art
And take in the Sacre- Coeur
.
A bottle of wine when I went to dine
On the St Gernain des Pris
Drunk another lot in  les Deux Maggot
I should not have done;  I agree
Cognac went down well in the hotel
My friends I tried not to embarrass
But the carpet rose and hit my nose
I was completely  plastered in Paris
