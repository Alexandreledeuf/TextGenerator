WHEN THERE IS NO HOPE AND NOTHING TO HOPE FOR
When there is no hope and nothing to hope for
When no specific path presents itself
When there seems no way out
When one has already tried so much
And not succeeded
When one is older and weaker
And knows one cannot be as good
As one once was
When that too was not good enough
When the only way open
Seems a natural going down
When there is no hope and nothing to hope for
And when one begins to think of â€˜miracles'
In a way one has never done before
When there seems no way out
And nothing to hope for
And one in desperation tries to think and think
Look and find
A new way
That will succeed at last
And nothing appears and nothing comes
When there is no hope and nothing to hope for
And Desperation deepens
And one cannot find the way out.
