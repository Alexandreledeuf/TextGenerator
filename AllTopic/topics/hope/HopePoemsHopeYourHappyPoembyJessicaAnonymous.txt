I hope your happy with your life
I hope your happy with your wife
I hope you see what you have done
I hope you see that this is all wrong
I hope you realise that your not perfect
I hope you see that money's not worth it
I hope you realise that family comes first
I hope you see that my smile was rehearsed
I hope you see that your tearing me apart
I hope you someday grow a heart
I hope someday I will want to see you
I hope someday I wont have to see you
I hope you suffer, but I dont want that
I hope you die, but I dont mean that
I hope someday your 'love' will be real
I hope someday you will 'feel'
I hope you realise that money cant heal
I hope someday you'll feel, what I feel
I hope that before you die
I hope to tell you, I wont cry
I hoped you would be a good dad
I hoped you wouldnt make me mad
But all my hopes from before are gone
just like the love you had for their mom
I hope that I see you one last time
I hope I get to tell you this:
'I wish I never knew you
because of you....I wish I didnt exist....'
