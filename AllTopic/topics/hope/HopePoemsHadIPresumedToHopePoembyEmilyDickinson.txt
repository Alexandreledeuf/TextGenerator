Had I presumed to hope—
The loss had been to Me
A Value—for the Greatness' Sake—
As Giants—gone away—
Had I presumed to gain
A Favor so remote—
The failure but confirm the Grace
In further Infinite—
'Tis failure—not of Hope—
But Confident Despair—
Advancing on Celestial Lists—
With faint—Terrestial power—
'Tis Honor—though I die—
For That no Man obtain
Till He be justified by Death—
This—is the Second Gain—
