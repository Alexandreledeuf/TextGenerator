Endless dark - or so it seems,
life is shattered, with all our dreams
of joy and hope, the fading light,
and darkness, darkness for all in sight.
No words can speak of pain that's borne,
or fears unfounded, the sharpest thorn,
deserted mind, with heart and soul,
the wish of death, the bell will toll.
A mind of riddles, flesh we scorn,
and hope for day, the light of dawn.
The night is long, the darkness set,
the hope of morn, existing yet?
But morn will be, and dark will fade,
the light of hope, the desert shade,
the winter's comfort, summer's breeze,
as blooms of spring, the sun appears,
a welcome friend, the silence broke,
my soul returns, my demons choke,
faith and hope I once more find,
in shadows of my heart and mind.
Reason warped by darkness' might,
arights in friendship's glorious light,
survival comes from God's own power,
endurance through my darkest hour.
