If you only care about the ones
within your small arms reach
there's so much you will never know
and I could never teach.
Life will be your teacher
you'll see things we have known.
If closely you will listen
you'll never be alone.
But, if you choose to focus
on you and only yours
so much joy will be kept from you
through simple unlocked doors.
I hope you never need a stranger
someone you've never met
cause you have to remember...
what you give is what you get.
