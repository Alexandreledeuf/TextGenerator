The tears fall, but no one's there to heed them,
The heart it mourns, but no one sees the hurt.
An emptiness has seeped into the brainstem,
One's feeling dazed, and no longer alert.
Such desolation haunts one's whole persona,
What can one do, and just where can one go,
You feel as if you've now become a loner,
How droplets, when they're prompted, freely flow.
To cry can be a painful kind of action,
One weeps for someone one has loved so well,
Yet grieving gives release, if just a fraction,
Which heals the ache and lets sadness dispel.
Only time will ease such utter sorrow,
That comes from losing someone Oh, so dear,
But with the dawning of each new tomorrow,
With faith and hope you'll find a panacea.
