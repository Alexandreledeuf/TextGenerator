I hope
That a friend in need
Is a freind indeed
And i hope
That the skys stay blue
And my friends
Are the same friends that i knew
And i hope
That this earth is still round
And that i will be found
And i hope
That my dreams are so clear
And when i wake up my eyes have no tears
And i hope
That ur hand is in mine
And with love theirs no time
And i hope
That i will survive
A broken heart this time
And i hope
And i hope
