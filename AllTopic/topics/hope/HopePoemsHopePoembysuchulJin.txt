Keep hope in your heart,
Keep it there till there's more.
More of what many should have, but are just to afraid to hold.
Hope is like a crystal, rare precious & bold.
Hope is what makes us humans, hope is whats in our souls.
Each day that comes & goes.
Each night that passes by is just another step for our hopes to come alive.
We see what's in right and wrong.
We see what's in bad and good.
We see what other's and most don't see.
What beauty and wonder hope can hold.
