The hissing wind and the swishing sea
with a vengeance turns the wind to lee
Ragging sails, the ship is free
Seagull screams in the distance see
Distraught people in a ship at sway
Creaking stern and the ropes'll, fray
Vociferous sounds of the angry spray
To ghastly thoughts the heart a prey
Not a soul aboard that doth not pray
Rising hands against the wicked gray
O' Lord 'Save us from the swishing array'
Confusion mounting screams of dismay
Such was the scene and even yet
A man in white I cannot forget
Unaware of all the cold and wet
he sat eyes closed and face all set
He muttered to himself now and then
free from feelings of where and when
The calm of his face in darkness shown
with a majestic grandeur; he left his throne
Thus he spoke to the people aloud
'Brothers and sisters look at the cloud
The lord remembers his creation's plight
Through the crevice comes a ray of light
The rescue boats you need not fight
For yonder look the landâ€™s in sight'
