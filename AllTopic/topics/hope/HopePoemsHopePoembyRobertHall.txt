I'm writing you this poem,
For you being you,
I'm writing you this poem,
Because I wanted to.
I'm writing you this poem,
Cause I thought of you,
I'm writing you this poem,
For the wonderful things you do.
You have taught me right from wrong,
You taught me how to love and praise,
You taught me how to be hopeful,
And now to be amazed.
Now it's my turn,
to be like you,
To follow God,
and look up to.
