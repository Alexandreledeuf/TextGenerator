Just remember that hope goes a long way.
As long as you have a little you are still doing okay.
Everything will be alright, the sun will start to shine,
Spring brings more hope but you may just have to look harder for it sometimes.
So, do not fret and do not cry,
The warmth of the air, the blue of the sky
Will dry your tears most of the time.
