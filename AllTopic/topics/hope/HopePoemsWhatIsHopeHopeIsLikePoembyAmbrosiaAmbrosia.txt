Hope, a magical word of four letters
Although everyone struggle to hold fast, scared of loosing it,
Never vanishes from anyone’s life, well what is hope?
Hope is like morning sun
Although an hour late or early,
Never forgets to rise, to start lively life
Hope is like twinkling stars
Although for a while hide behind dark clouds,
Never stop emitting starlight, even in the darkest night
Hope is like enchanting moon
Although disappears for a fortnight,
Never fails to sooth us wherever, however, whatever we are
Hope is like tender grass root
Although gets crushed for few days
Never give up, peeps out beside the hardest rocks and tiles
Hope is like nature
Although attacked by miscreants, calamities
Never allow anyone to perish its infinite flora and fauna
Hope is like newborn baby
Although cry a bit after birth to proclaim its entry
Never get in the way of putting smile on anyone’s face
Hope is like tomorrow
Although comes with mixed bag of joy and sorrow
Never ignores anyone, its there for everyone
Hope is like faith in GOD
Although faints occasionally in difficult times
Never disappoints anyone in the end
RAY OF HOPE SHOULD NEVER GO OUT OF ANYBODY’S LIFE
