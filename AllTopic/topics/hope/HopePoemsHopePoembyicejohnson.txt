Im not crazy
Im not dreaming
I hope
hope hope hope
There has to be a way
Not the best way but a least a way
We have to run out of this place
We have to free ourselves from this masacre
Start from scratch from this disaster
We have to get out with the hope we have
Hope Hope Hope Hope
your all I got
