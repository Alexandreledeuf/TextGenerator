Hope
Hope and Faith go hand in hand.
Hope for the future.
Hope leads to a brighter future.
Hope for riches
Life would be different without hope.
The power of hope makes us hold on.
In the worst of times hope is there.
Hope fuels our courage.
It makes hearts stronger.
Hope doesn't just give up on us.
Hope is like faith one must have both.
