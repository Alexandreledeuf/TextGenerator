Switch off the TV, stop all sounds
Shut down the comp, turn off the lights
Let no one come calling
When I am alone.
Thoughts on the death row
Memories wheezing
like a worn away mono.
Emptiness is nothing
but a burnt away log
in the forest of impossibilities.
I didn’t hear you then,
I wouldn’t see you now
You are just an x-ray sheet
of soul painted in black.
You call me an escapist,
I only outran your lies.
I drank your tears
Cups of poison steeped in shame.
You are nothing but an effigy
Even ghosts fear to enter.
Come out of your own shadow
I ask you to face the mirror
Your image is nothing but pleasure
etched in horror.
Fade away into insignificance.
Please let me be me.
I can get real
With the vastness of time.
