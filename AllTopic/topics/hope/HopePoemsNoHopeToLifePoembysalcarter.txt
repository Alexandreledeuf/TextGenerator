Grey street corner
A frozen room
Lonely bed
A dying moon
Litter swept streets
And templed stars
Blurred rising sun
Hits burnt out cars.
Hate scrawled text
On bricked in walls
From cancered branch
A last leaf falls
The knife drawn streets
Barred with shops,
The downward wound
That never stops.
A Frostbitten tree
A pock marked road.
First morning truck
With a heavy load.
Gun ruled streets
Of bricks and knives
Discarded dreams
And shattered lives.
A world of pain
A world of snow
Nowhere to leave
No place to go
With no hope
To a world forlorn
No route to life
A child is born
