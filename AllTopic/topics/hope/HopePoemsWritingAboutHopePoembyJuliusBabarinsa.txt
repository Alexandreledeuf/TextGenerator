Every human being living on this earth hope for something

Several men hope for a wife who is as caring as their mother
Many women hope for husbands who is as loving as their father

While the police hope that every person will be law-abiding

Medical doctors hope their patients will recuperate faster
Careful drivers hope that other drivers will drive like them

While the students hope the teachers will give them easy exams
The colleges hope that all students will pay their tuition promptly
Farmers always hope for good and abundant harvest

All politicians hope to get elected and re-elected
Employers hope their workers will volunteer for overtime
Every architect always hope to design the best building in town

What are your personal hopes on this earth?
What are your hopes for your family?
What are your hopes for your country?
The day we humans stop hoping on this earth
Will be the day we cease to be members of this beautiful planet
Please remember to stay happy and cheerful
