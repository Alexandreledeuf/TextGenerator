Once in your lifetime,
You would have thought that
What am I doing with my life?
You might think that your future is blank.
You may think your career is in a crossroads.
You may think that you have made bad choices.
You may even think that life is full of shit.
But know this,
Whatever happens, happens for a reason.
You are here for a reason.
There is a purpose for your existence.
Think of this whenever you feel down, whenever you feel that that life sucks.
Everything happens for the Greater good,
Always think of this after every failure.
“HOPE IS LIFE.”
