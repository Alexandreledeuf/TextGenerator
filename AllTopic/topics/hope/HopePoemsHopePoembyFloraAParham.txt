AS I LOOK INTO THE FUTURE,
I HOPE FOR PEACE.
PEACE OF MIND
PEACE OF MAN
PEACE OF THE SPIRIT.
I HOPE FOR MORE LOVE OF GOD,
FOR IN THIS LIES THE HOPE OF MANKIND.
GOD IS LOVE
GOD IS EVERYTHING!
LIFE IS GOD'S GIFT TO MAN.
HOPE IS THE WANTING OF A BETTER FUTURE
OF A RICHER MEANING OF WHAT LOVE IS ALL
ABOUT.
I NEED YOU
YOU NEED ME
OUR NEED FOR EACH OTHER.
CHILDREN NEED HOPE
TO FEEL THERE IS A BETTER LIFE
FOR NOW, AND FOR THEIR FUTURE.
WE NEED HOPE TO SURVIVE
THE BLOWS OF LIFE!
