When the desperation hit
When the people cried in the streets
When everything felt at loss
Hope stayed, even though fleaing would be easier
When the eyes were full of tears.
When kids and families were torn apart
By that last desperate grasp
Hope tried
When all else gave up
When all else backed off
When people lost all they had
Hope flew
When they cried
When the world was shocked with desperation and dispair
When nothing seemed good
Hope worked
When those four planes crashed
When the buildings fell
When the lives were lost
Hope was there
Hope was only a tiny glimmer
Hope was still there
She ran to those who needed her
She worked to help
When all else failed
Hope didn't
She flew through us all
Letting us know, we still had her
We just needed to look hard enough
Hope was there
Hope remembers
