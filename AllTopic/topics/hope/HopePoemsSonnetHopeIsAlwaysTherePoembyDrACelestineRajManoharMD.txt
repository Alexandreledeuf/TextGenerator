There is a faint Rainbow in the night's Sky;
The scorching-Summer has not had mid-show'rs;
The air is hot and sultry, very dry;
The trees have scarcely any leaves or flow'rs.
In Life, things turn unbearable, so oft;
Our patience gets outlasted to its brink;
Who will say words that soothen every heart?
Our sinful souls thirst for a graceful drink.
Yet, miracles will happen although late;
The God of Love and kindness watches us;
There is nothing called destiny or fate;
God gives the tolerance for every stress.
So, wait with patience for times better , Man;
For things happen according to God's plan.
