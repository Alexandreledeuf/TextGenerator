Don't give up hope
Don't give up hope
There is still a whole slew of scope in hope
I know how you feel
Your predicament is unpleasant and real
Before you crumble and stumble
Like a lone wolf in your solitary struggles
I hear the sadness in your tongue
Realize that your suffering will pass
Its duration may be long
Hang in there, be strong
I know the words to your plightful song
You are not where you wish to belong
But giving up hope is forever wrong
A flower never fumbles and gives up hope
While waiting for its daily water
Hope is all to it that matters
Don't give up hope
Don't give up hope
Clutch on tight to all ropes
There is still a whole slew of scope in hope
