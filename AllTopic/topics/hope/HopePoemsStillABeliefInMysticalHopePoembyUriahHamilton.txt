I’m searching the expansive, azure sky
For a woman’s anodyne brown eyes
That escaped from her face
To watch this place,
Keep my heartbeats and breaths in view,
Saying enlightened prayers
Into the compassionate air
Of God’s loving universe.
Everything is going to work
And ease the hurt
From a thousand wounds
Inflicted by yesterday’s knife.
The future is a healing balm
And a good luck charm
Against the darkness and disaster
Still looming in childhood
Gloomy clouds and unhappy nightmares.
