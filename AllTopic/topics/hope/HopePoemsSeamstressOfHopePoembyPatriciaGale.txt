Angel of hope come to me
Mend my heart with golden thread
Weave your healing all around
In and out through my soul
Patches of love to cover the void
Made from the finest in the land
Tenderly spin me a new dream
One of love and hope in between
Cradle my heart
In finest silk
Softly and sensual to the touch
But strong for many years of wear
Show me with pride
Give me to one who will cherish
A slightly used but still useful heart
One that will keep them warm with love forever more
