The heart is a womb where hope is born
It is conceived in the mind
Believed to be blind
Hope is a quest to be free
An open door or key
-To a foreign place
A race that can be won
A belief in something strong
In things unseen or unheard
Hope sounds absurd
But we can live on hope and dreams
On schemes built on itself
Hope and dreams are our wealth!
