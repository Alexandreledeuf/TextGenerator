There was this hope
In one man's dream:
With all his heart,
Therein it seems...
Of memories gone
Of love and care,
For years go on
Those are so dear.
I felt it too
In dreams of mine,
Just like in yours,
They well on did shine.
And sometimes I found,
When I walked alone:
They kept me bound,
Though they had flown.
For life is a touch
Of those hidden things,
That we love so much
And to us again sings.
