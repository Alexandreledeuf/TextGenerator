Who hath constructed the elements
And their atoms' configuration?
Who hath designed every molecule
And shapes their chemical formation?
Who hath conceived the laws of nature
And completed their limitation?
Who hath set galaxies in motion
And did establish time's duration?
Who hath created every life form
And made conscious their domination?
Who hath set parameters on flesh
And gives spirit's continuation?
Who hath numbered the celestial stars
And sand of the sea computation?
Who hath multiplied Abraham's kin
And favored their many a nation?
It hath been Yehovah's creation
