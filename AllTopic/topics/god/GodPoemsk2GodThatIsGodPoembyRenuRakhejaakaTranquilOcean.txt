Waves of strength
Surging in You and Me
That is God, That is God
Stream of compassion
Flowing in You and Me
That is God, That is God
Trembling consciousness
Quivering in You and Me
That is God, That is God
Creative juices
Flowing in You and Me
That is God, That is God
Undying Spirit
Burning in You and Me
That is God, That is God
Throbbing Heart
Overflowing with love in You and Me
That is God, That is God
