Love is God and God is love
"Love is God and God is love" all may say
I found no name that actually professed these words to lay
I bow my head to preachers who really follow the spirit
And guide the masses to bow their head and touch the feet
It has become customary and now a show business
Visit temple, mosque or church in order to confess
It is good on the part of human being to obey
And learn the teachings by heart and pray
Many may be seriously praying for universal happiness
So many may be secretly donating for the serious cases
Yet the genuine concern occupies the religion centers
As they have to rush to the needy poor to cater
All said and not done in true essence
We swear by God but speak lies in his presence
We only object blasphemy but in real life act contrary
General awareness with staunch followers is necessary
I weep with tears when see the Christ on cross
What a feeling in mind with complete remorse
Why did we commit cruelty when He was our messiah?
I feel great when hear churches bell ring or hear the name of Allah
I may be illiterate in literally terms
It will be of no use to look at holy book to turn
The writing may cut little in my mind
Yet I know it is great message from him to find
What has he not done for mankind as whole?
Tolerated all cruelties and found body with holes
"Give them some sense not to repeat ills"
I shall not deviate from my path even if they kill
Such a saint or God is not among us
But his spirit prevails in form of trust
We believe each and every word
Cry with open mind and far of no sword
"He may guide us to nobility"
Make us capable and worthy
O supreme god and almighty
You are our savior, messiah or deity
