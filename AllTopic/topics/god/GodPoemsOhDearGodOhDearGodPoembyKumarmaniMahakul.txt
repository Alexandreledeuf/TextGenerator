Where are you? Our dear father,
We call you without sure bother.
Oh dear God you hear oh dear God,
Minds have gathered here to nod.
We observe everything is illusion,
Confusion takes us in mind fusion.
You are father you are true only,
In false streets we travel lonely.
Today we are here tomorrow we not
In lap of death sure life is caught.
We search you moving on here ever,
We go on working forget you never.
Oh God dear father you super light,
Spark soon in boon to make us bright.
