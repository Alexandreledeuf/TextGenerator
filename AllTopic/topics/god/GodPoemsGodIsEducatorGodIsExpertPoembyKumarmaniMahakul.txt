A degree is not a measure of writing,
A degree is not the knowledge,
Through degree a person gets a job
Through job he earns money,
A degree does not make a man
Educator or expert although we tell so,
Money does not make good human being.
Through money we can get only inventions.
Values and morality we cannot buy from market,
Righteousness cannot be purchased at all,
When we keep our mind in God and trust,
We receive his positive vibrations,
Through long spiritual perseverance
A man gains values and righteousness.
Educator is he, who is full of knowledge,
Boss is he, who has full control
Over this entire creation we feel,
Expert is he, who is very knowledgeable,
If people laugh billions of times
Truth is not going to change,
Fire never becomes water if people laugh
And water never becomes fire,
Force of Gravitation does not change
Even if people laugh or try to change,
Law of action does not change,
All laws of universe work perfectly.
God is boss of creation and poetry,
God is full of knowledge
He is the only educator and expert,
No one can be like him at all,
God's lovers know him very well,
You cannot defame God by any means
A son cannot defame his own father,
God is our and your eternal father,
If a son defames his own father
He falls in severe sin and hell,
But our father is very merciful
He redeems all from hell and sin!
Being educator God teaches us values,
Being expert he guides us in pure language,
Being boss of all things and poetry,
God commands us to have righteousness,
A right path we should chose always!
God's path is right path of knowledge.
