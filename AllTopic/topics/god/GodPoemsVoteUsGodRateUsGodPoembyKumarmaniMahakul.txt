Vote us oh God, dear God,
Rate us oh God, dear God,
Save us oh save us God,
Sprinkle thy mercy on us!
Rate us with resistance power,
Vote us with wonderful vaccine,
All atheists have turned,
They are planning to transform,
Atheists were running behind wealth,
Leaving you and your rules,
Atheists were planning to destroy
But you preserve your garden,
You rightly keep resources!
Corona has captured this Earth,
By your super power you throw,
Let Corona Virus leave this world,
Let all medicinal plants grow,
Reforming time and Earth,
You do wonder dear Master God,
Only you can save us at this time!
An appeal we do to you to vote us,
We know you rate us giving full point,
Getting ten we get delighting light,
You vote us and put us in power,
So that we can be victorious
And Corona will be defeated,
Corona has cut the throat,
Corona has thrown us out of
Five hundred planets,
Due to fear of death and the defeat,
Our friends are crying in agony,
You empower us bringing into top,
You save our civilization and lives!
