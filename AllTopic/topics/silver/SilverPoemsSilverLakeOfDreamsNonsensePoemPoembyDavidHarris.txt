Across the silver lake of dreams,
a malevolent pixie sits,
with rod in hand,
and line in water,
trying to catch the rainbow,
with its pot of gold.
His line of silver thread,
strung out and invisible,
against the water,
holds the magic of the world,
forgotten by mortal command.
Here we see a dragonfly,
of rainbow colours glide,
inches above the waters,
of the silver lake of dreams.
