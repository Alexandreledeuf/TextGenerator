Smile spread across features
As love traces a pathway
Finding itself inside my heart
Facades shatter as reality
Defrosts hopes left behind
Replacing with the heat
Of future grasped tightly
Eyes wide open in surprise
At the strength of this emotion
Uninvited but still welcomed
With abandoned pleasure
Whats gone cant be retrieved
But my eyes look to the horizon
Seeing that ripple of silver flowing
Forward to seek my soul out
