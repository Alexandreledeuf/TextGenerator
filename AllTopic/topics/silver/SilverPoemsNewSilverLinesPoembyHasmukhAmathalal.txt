Parliamentary democracy is shield to cheat
With smile on face when they collectively meet
Countless hours are wasted on stalling the business
The emergence of rowdy scene usually surface
It was one in million chances to succeed
The entire country is engulfed with cast and creed
No one has spared the Indian soil with their known greed
How could one stay aloof when country is still not freed?
People are disgruntled with such type of liberal democracy
It has firmly established people’s supremacy
Everything is done on the name of people’s welfare
In fact their interest is compromised as who takes care?
The pilferage and looting of public money is on large scale
The judiciary has almost become beyond reach and failed
Some of the selected cases only come in for public notice
It is really a sad show for world’s largest democracy of promises
No country can prosper if loop holes are applied
The public is not kept well informed and information is withheld
They have right to know what is going on in the holy land
Who is their real protector and stands as friend?
It is uncertain about effective diplomacy
Each party is consolidating its position and remains busy
National interest is not their concern but a compulsion
The whole of nation’s priority is utterly in confusion
We really hope that nations may survive
Some of the good steps are to be taken and revived
The country needs to protect poor and their interest
The politicians must come forward and serve to their best
