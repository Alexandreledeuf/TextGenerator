Nothing should be remembered
If that was not offered
Nothing should be thought over
If opportunity was denied ever
The past should not to be taken seriously
The present should be spent continuously
There has to be no break with on going process
All doors should be kept open for future access
The river water flows with no aim
The shore is knocked but nothing more is there to claim
The destination is never thought of
Still it flows with carved path and pass through
Let us be the last to think
Before ship gives way and starts to sink
No hope should be allowed to fade
Until there is silver line to find the shade
Think if we were to spend life in easy manner
There was no scope to learn for beginner
As it was providing everything in smooth way
What was left then in life to try hard way?
