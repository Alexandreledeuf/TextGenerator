A quarter century has gone,
Since we had become medicos!
We can't believe the fleeting time
That changed us, and the world around.
Those years when we had joined this place,
It was not full of comforts much;
But now our Alma Mater is
A med-city within city!
How time has changed the landscape past!
New blocks have sprung up very fast;
A few teachers who taught us here
Remain slogging for students dear!
The knowledge they had shared with us
Has made us whatever we are;
We thank our teachers dear from heart,
Who lit the lamps in our lives then.
The campus brings us ev'rgreen thoughts
Of days when we were students here;
Despite the toil and struggles past,
We are better than what we'd thought!
We see our teachers somewhat old;
Whatev'r they told us was like gold;
We see our batchmates' kith and kin;
Our life on earth has been a win!
Our hearts are filled with emotions
Of pleasant thoughts of our stay here;
Though we may change akin fashions,
Our love for Alma Mater's clear!
We thank the Management, Trustees,
Who did so much to make us, Docs;
We thank those who helped treat disease,
And God, who made us priceless rocks!
Our job on earth is just begun;
We love to serve our sick brethren;
There are more good things to be done;
We want to make our earth, heaven!
