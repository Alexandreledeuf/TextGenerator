My hair is laced with silver now
For time has seized my youth
I’ve lost the count of seasons passed -
The mirror shows the truth
With eyes that sleep in long repose
And limbs now void of tone -
The years have taken full their toll
As I am older grown
Yet in my heart there is a space
Where time does not accrue -
Where youthfulness does ever shine
And all the world is new
Where passion moves as much as when
My years were counted less -
And love does stir my weary soul
To sing with joyfulness
There too is set within my heart
A brightling star that shines -
And sweet the wine I’m sipping from
Fresh fruit upon the vines
So I will raise a glass to youth
And all the joy it brings -
Will sing a song to celebrate
The freedom of its wings
Oh, I will sing, yes I will sing
A song in praise of Spring
For Spring is ever in my heart
Such fortitude to bring
Then I will pray each morning that
Before I’m laid to rest
My soul shall ever be imbued
With youthful heart, so blessed
