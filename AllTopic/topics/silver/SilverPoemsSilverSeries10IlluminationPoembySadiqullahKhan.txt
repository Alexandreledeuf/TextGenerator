The Buddha
Illuminated
Or she has the illuminations
Of Buddha starving
Nirvana
Brings her eyes
And lips
Farewell the sage
Of the beauty of the world
Jesus crumbled
To the sensuality
Of senses
The fall of those majestic
Hips
On knees
To the phallic god
Illumination has different kinds
She knows
To breathe
The free spirit
