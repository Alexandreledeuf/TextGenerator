THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER
Those early Roman days, were not much
different,
When bribery, corruption and evil ways,
had also prevailed!
Politicians crossed the floor of the Senate, -
like politicians of our days!
Morality, human values, and actions and
deeds,
Had  price tags to satisfy human greed!
Both terrorists and traitors could be tempeted
by the devil,
To satisfy human lust and for the spread of
evil!
I often recall how Judas had betrayed,
By planting the traitors kiss on his Masters
face;
And sold Jesus to the Romans in a villanous
barter trade!
Thirty pieces of silver, became the price of
Judas soul,
For thirty pieces of silver, his Master he had
sold!
Thiry pieces of silver, was all that Judas got;
In exchange of hell fire and damnation as his
eternal lot!
