He not only listens but pays
Complete attention with silver rays
Make your path smooth and easy
So you don’t forget him despite being busy
Though you have different perception
God knows it from inception
Your needs and aspirations are all well known
Only you admit the faults and make it known
Why do you with all the helplessness?
Why you have to hide the feelings and face?
He is all the time there to take care
You have only to find him somewhere
You won’t find him at particular place
You must watch it with view to trace
If you fail in your attempt any case
It will be really bad time with critical phase
It has to be our regular prayer and feature
He has sealed our fate with signature
We got to obey Him and go to his shelter
It is with one aim to perform always better
