Moonlight shatters
The crystals disperse
Flakes of winter
Fright's curse
Grey clouds of nowhere
Silver world awakes
To the silver sun beams
To the silver birds of song
Silver world awakes not to pleasure
Not to rhyme
Silver world awakes to sorrow
To the silver tear drop, crying
And with every tear the color fades
And more silver becomes the day
Spindling more silver
The silver devils play
And in my castle I hear the cry
The sharp shrieks of broken delight
The blinding light
The shivering fright
And in my castle I hear the wind
That humbles the calls
That corrodes my walls
The silver hissing wind
Driving nails into my coffin
The silver hissing wind
A dead heart will never soften
Meaningless are my dreams
Evanescent dreams
Grey clouds
Silver world
Faded clockwork, clicks
The hour passes, the hand ticks
And I awake into my dreams
Decadent reality, bursting seams
The clock now stops and forever so
Till I return but I shall not go
