They bade you softly,
They bade you so -
'Do not go, do not go, '
To the pale and silver moon's blue silk and blossom
They fail you softly
Their words -
They fail you so
- To the pale and silver moon's blue silk and blossom
And in the snow
Yes - in the snow
Where words do pale, but justice do
The silver moon's blue silk and blossom
You trusted through
You trusted through
