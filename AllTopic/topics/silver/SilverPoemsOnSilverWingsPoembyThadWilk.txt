Somewhere over the rainbow
beyond the naked eye. There's
a place one day my soul shall go.
On silver wings there I shall fly...
~
A kingdom is there, 'tis a heaven so
divine. The beauty and it's splendor
are beyond the the realms of space
and time.
~
In this heavenly light, dark clouds are
never there. Only dazzling clouds of
snowy white;  you can feel His love,
flowing through the air.
~
Somewhere over the rainbow, there
in yonder ski. When I am called to
go one day I'll tell my friends good by.
I'll find my way to heaven then and on
silver wings there I shall fly...
