I bought a pair of silver sneakers
So I could run on God's golden road.
The laces were spun of shinny silver thread
And tipped with the purest of purest gold.
I could run faster than the speed of light
Everytime I placed them on my feet.
The feeling they gave me when I ran
Was a feeling noting could ever beat.
I joined in running Heaven's marathon
With my number placed on my back and chest.
To be viewed by all God's Angel's
Cheering me on to finish my spiritual quest.
I worked so hard to get to see this day
The one where I could run on God's golden streets.
And to hear the Angel's playing Heavenly music
While wearing those silver sneakers upon
My now Angelic feet.
