It's very hard to pronounce and the prince's name is Legerdemain.
His patchy wallet contains a picture of Madonna and full of rubbish.
He is not a cherub it seems.
The scars of his wrist a handiwork like tattoos of different handcuffs he wore.
His Pidgin English and the moisten heart
Does somebody could understand?
Then he will be surprised.
He is a pickpocket and one day he found his deceased mother's photo
In a stolen wallet and he said goodbye to his sorrowful career.
