Those were the days of toil, turmoil;
Those were the years of learning joy;
Those were the times of challenges;
Those were moments, we can’t forget!
Those were the happiest days in life;
Those were the times of great resolve;
Those were the years we loved the most;
Those were the dreams that came so true!
Our Management was great from start;
Our teachers taught ‘medical art’;
Our college then looked not so vast;
Oh, how we miss the life that’s past!
And we were just a little batch!
We turned out to be ‘prized a catch’!
Our college life can’t come again;
Our teachers put us in right lane.
We did not have much capital;
We did not have own hospital;
We saw few patients in the ward;
Nevertheless, we worked just hard.
And God had blessed us for His part!
We smile and laugh with good a heart;
We love our teachers who taught us;
They shared their knowledge without fuss!
God, bless our Doctor Teachers dear!
’Tis nice to see them still, so near;
They sacrificed in nobler ways;
God grant them health and peaceful days!
Fondly dedicated to the Management, Teachers
And students of the First Batch of Medicos of
PSGIMS&R, CBE, ‘Silver Jubilee Meet’
