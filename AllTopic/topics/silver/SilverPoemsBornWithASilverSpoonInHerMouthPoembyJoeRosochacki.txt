Margaret Daalman,52, a woman that is Dutch,
Margaret, outside her insatiable appetite, she didn't complain to much.
Ms. Daalman had an unusual  craving for many utensils.
She appeared to favor them just as the witch had,
To consume many Hansels and Gretels.
She had consumed flatware in her body, in all 78 pieces,
Enough to serve 34 settings without the knives, in her digestive tract.
In fact,
Doctors diagnosed her with pica disease.
The metals, such as iron zinc,
-had attributed to her hunger pangs for years.
Margaret tolerated her pain, I think,
Though it most likely brought her tears.
Finally, she couldn't take anymore and had to have surgery.
Among the flatware taken out of body were forks and spoons.
She ate some of them in morning, at lunch, at dinner,
During the day and quarter, half, three quarter, and new moons.
Lucky she didn't have them pass,
For it would be an Amsterdam it, pain in the ass.
