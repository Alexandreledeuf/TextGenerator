Silver Kisses of Moonlight
Chase The Shadows From Your Face
All Around Is Darkness
Except The Glow Of Your Embrace
And The Stargaze of Your Eyes
And Luminous Pearls Thru Smiling Lips
The Shimmery Mist of Your Sweet Breath
Cool Fires From Your Fingertips
The Glints of Whispers Heard
The Sparks Of Passions Stirred
A Silken Solar Power Beamed! …
Illumed Within – Emerged
Soared Up To Unite
Explosions, Hearts Ignite
To Celebrate The Cosmic Sight
Of Two Souls Waking Up The Night

Silver Kisses In Moonlight
As Sleep Shadows Your Face
All Around Is Darkness
Except The Glow Of Your Embrace
