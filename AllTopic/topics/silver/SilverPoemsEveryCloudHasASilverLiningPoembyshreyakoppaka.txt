There is darkness all around,
It’s only silence no sound,
In the black it looks like,
There won’t be day but only night,
But wait soon will come the sun’s rays,
As after the darkest of nights is the brightest of days.
All doors are tightly locked,
Can’t be heard when knocked,
No where to go,
Nowhere to run,
Only wait in silence,
For death to come,
But don’t let hope die,
For it comes only when you try,
One door does open when all are shut,
Look for the open door get up.
No water far far away in desert sand,
No sign of life but only bare land,
It’s a bluff of eye, water’s sight,
There is nothing there that can cause delight,
But don’t give up and don’t dismiss,
The chance of finding a desert oasis.
Lead life with faith and hope,
Only then you can with tensions cope,
Think always tomorrow is shinning,
And that every cloud has a silver lining! !
