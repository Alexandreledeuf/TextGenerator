In the dark
Dark clouds and tides
Revolving round
The epicentre
of stormy life
I can go to hate it
For thousand reasons
But for one thin line
I am alive
in silvery light
it writes on my forehead
‘’you will  not die before
deciphering the meaning
of meaninglessness of life
till you feel lifted
and continue your writes ‘’
