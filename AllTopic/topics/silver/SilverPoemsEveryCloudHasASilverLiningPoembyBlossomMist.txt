If the days are long and dark is the night, it is not worth crying
For, Every Cloud has a Silver Lining
If the faith is low, making you low
Stop wait a step or two, to get up and flow.
Soar as an eagle and spread your wings
Take in your stride wat life brings
Youâ€™re one in a million, keep your fire burning
For, Every Cloud has a Silver Lining.
