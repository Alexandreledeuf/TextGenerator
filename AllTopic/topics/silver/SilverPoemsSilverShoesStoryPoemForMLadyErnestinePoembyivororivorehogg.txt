Sometimes when the night is falling.
I can hear them softly calling.
Come and dance the night away
the moon is shining bright as day.
My fairy friends are gathering
to dance within the fairy ring.
I leave the comfort of my chair
and go outside to find them there.
Already to commence the dance.
I watch them as they skip and prance.
I am too big to join the dance
but gladly given half a chance.
I would discard my human guise
and dwindle down to be their size
Titania points her wand at me.
I find I am quite suddenly.
Much  smaller than I used to be.
The fairy maids all laugh with glee,
each one wants to dance with me
I gladly join the revelry.
We dance until the morning breaks.
A single word is all it takes
to restore me to my own size.
Titania is very wise.
She weaves another magic spell.
I can recall but cannot tell.
When I awake in my old chair
Gripped in my hand I find a pair
of tiny silken, silver shoon
the colour of a bright new moon.
A little keep sake it would seem
to prove to me it was no dream.
