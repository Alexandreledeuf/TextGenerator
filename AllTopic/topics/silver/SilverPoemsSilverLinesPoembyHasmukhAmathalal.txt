Sky was studded with dark clouds,
Rushing all over with big sounds,
Impeded danger of heavy down pour,
Adding of woes to already poor,
I never felt so poor and helpless,
Why He was using the goodness?
Tearing apart the dark clouds,
Who were waiting for flash pounds?
She was kept bonded behind the dark,
Would have been freed with little spark?
There were silver lines ready to burst,
I had full faith and bestowed trust,
Suddenly it took dramatic turn,
Sun rays were making complete return,
Sky was lit with bright sun shine,
She stood there smiling for the while,
I couldnâ€™t understand the simple massage,
Why clouds disappeared while making passage?
May be it was temporary phase?
I thanked God and took it with complete ease,
There was impeding danger like dark clouds,
I was slowly loosing my ground,
Love was HIS blessings and newly found,
All agreed for union and came round,
I wish it to happen with all my friends,
Who wished me success and flowers send?
My story was not success but had happy end,
Turning to HIM for success was not new but good trend
