The look in your eyes, often tries
And succeeds in showing
you care
The old loved smile, familiar now
A hint of the thoughts we share
Twenty five years, a long time once
Now folded in the immediate past
Who would have thought,
on our wedding day
A quarter century would go so fast
The champagne flows, as it has
so often before
I touch wood and silently call
The fates to ensure
That they be kind and destiny mind
Where we go and how
This journey is not half-way yet
As we look back now
Let us celebrate, by all means
Out life together this while
But the best is yet to be
Say your eyes, your smile
