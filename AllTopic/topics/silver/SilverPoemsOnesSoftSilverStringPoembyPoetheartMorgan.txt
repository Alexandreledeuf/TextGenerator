The well is full
but it not  overflows
a draining mechanism
Keeps it  Leveled
the seed of the desert
stored inside the chest
sleep, does not germinate
but is ready to sprout
Awaits the the well leak!
lost love, bad memories
their defenses, pain
perfectly filed and labeled
with all sorts of excuses
The desert awaits for ruling
The body sick  the killer mind
the lack of love for inhumanity
false kisses, false words
so kindly treasured by impunity
Await the excuses ending
Oh! So many waits and
i need a flood of water
One seed to sprout
before someone touch one's soft silver string
