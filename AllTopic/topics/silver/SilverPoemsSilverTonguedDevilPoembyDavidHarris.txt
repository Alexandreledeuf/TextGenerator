Everywhere you go
and no matter what you do,
you will find a silver-tongued devil
who will talk you into parting
with your hard earnt cash.
Theyâ€™ll promise you things
you have always thirsted for,
but only at a price
and once they have you hooked,
they will try and entice you more
at an additional cost
and so it goes on and on
until you are broke or get wise,
then the silver-tongued devil
just promptly disappears
before your eyes.
