It leaves behind
Impression so kind
To bear in heart
For life time as an art
Love in later stage
That affects complete age
But clearly defines too
The role of divine power true
No body hunger
No personal anger
But still something short
To feel and honestly report
Yes something is felt
Fragrance from flower is smelt
There emerges wish for alliance
Close acquaintance and presence
I think it makes perfect combination
With solid bond and relation
Where two soul long for each other
He wishes long life for her
Not her wish alone
But gentle wind is blown
From direction unknown
Yet love and affection is known
Think about His presence
In every gesture with essence
Love sparks some light
Where person feels it right
No where you may find
“Love is kind and blind”
There is no color or cast
Yet that emerges very fast
The creed matters less
Faith is no where to trace
Thee is bright sun shine
There is happiness in silver line
