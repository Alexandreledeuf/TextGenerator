I closed the door to my heart
threw the silver little key
into the great big rapied waves
of the pacific ocean
i went on my way out in
the world of unknown
never going to have the same heart again
He walked though the hot sand
leaveing foot prints for
the world to see swam out in the rapied waves of the ocean
to find the little silver key
to this day he is still seaching
for the little silver key
fighting to find it.
