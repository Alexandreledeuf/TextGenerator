Within the silver shadows
are locked our golden dreams
waiting patiently for us
to find the key and then set them free.
Dreams of love everlasting
to last us through our days,
dreams of happiness for evermore,
to let us smile through our lifeâ€™s troubles.
They lay within the silver shadows
locked away in the recesses of our mind,
those golden dreams we dream about
from time to time.
The meandering wasteland,
within our shell of eternity,
where our dreams sleep,
awaiting us to awake them to make their escape.
The key is in us to unlock them
from within the silver shadows
where our golden dreams await
to be free to come true.
