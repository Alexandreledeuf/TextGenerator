Silver spoon, or no food on the spoon,
Well to do, or merciless goon?
Noon day sun, or midnight gloom,
What spells success, or imminent doom?
We are all the same, yet, not the same,
Black and white, what's in a name?
Born to live, or born to die,
Why do some laugh, while others cry?
If, in his image, we all are made,
Why do some prosper, whlie others fade?
Why are some chained, while some are free,
Does he smile at you, and frown at me?
