Silver things are pretty things
they fill us with such delight.
Like the tinsel on a Christmas tree
all glittering in the light.
Silver things can be simple things
and very homely too, such as a silver
buckle that fastens up a shoe.
Silver things are Natures things
like the frost on an Autumn Morn.
When all the harvest is over and it's time
to scatter the corn.
Silver things are sacred things which are
very close to the heart. Like the blessing of
a couple who have been there for each other
right from the start.
This is ourTwenty Fifth Anniversary of our
Wedding Day. When on that day we took our vows
'To Love Honour and Obey!
