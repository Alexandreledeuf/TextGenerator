Do we have any option?
To play the part in relation
The role assigned is unknown
Mistakes are considered of your own
For any mischief you are blamed
For any misdeeds you are shamed
Not a single act brings an honor
You are condemned therefore
The life stage is of different type
You can not shout or hype
Over the success in open
As it comes all of sudden
Sometimes you are driven
To the extreme corner even
Sometimes you are raised high
Your wings are ready to fly
Not all people are born with silver spoon
So many struggle hard in afternoon under hot sun
They are subjected to hard for not good return
But joy and happiness is sweet in turn
It is good to be part of circus
Play as character with trust
It is with intense desire to prove successful
Life is projected as beautiful and wonderful
