Just look at that sweet thang
wearing that tight silver wrap!
At a table nearby, he sat, inhaling
and exhaling smoke rings
eyes sparing not a minute
off that sweet southern bell.
yet keeping
not his desire tightly
under his cap, or his
dazzling red eyes off her
bell-shape bottom, and
salavating like pavlo's dog.
He grabs and held her tight!
Peeled off her shiny wrap-
completely exposing her milk
chocolate body.
Extending his trembling hands
to meet her offer, beads of moisture rising
like the morning dew, cooling his forehead.
The hard-eating chocoholic
grabbed silver-bell off the table,
tossed It into his waiting mouth,
circled it with his tongue, the
milk chocolate flowing down his chin
He smacked his lips in delight...:
