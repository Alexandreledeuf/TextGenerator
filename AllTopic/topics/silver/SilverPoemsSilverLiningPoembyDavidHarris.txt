They say every cloud
has a silver lining
and every true friend
a heart of gold.
In some moments
of distress,
we do not often see
what is there before our eyes.
Our judgement is clouded
and our worries conceal
what others try to give us
in hope and unconditional love.
The silver lining in our friends
is not always visible
and sometimes we are too blind
to see it there.
