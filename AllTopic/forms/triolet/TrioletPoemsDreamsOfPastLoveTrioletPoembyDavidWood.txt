Every day I sit in the café and think of you
Over a glass of iced coffee and doughnut
Our love was so sweet gentle and true
Every day I sit in the café and think of you
You walked away out of my life making me blue
Now I watch young girls walk by flouncing their strut
Every day I sit in the café and think of you
Over a glass of iced coffee and doughnut
