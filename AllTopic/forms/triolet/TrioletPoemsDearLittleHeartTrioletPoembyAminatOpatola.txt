Dear little heart with dread and pain,
consider life a cheat and rise up like day,
wind up thy soul and freeze out the strain,
Dear little heart with dread and pain,
trod out thy burn and cast sorrows constrain,
linger with days and walk out with rays,
Dear little heart with dread and pain,
consider life a cheat and rise up like day.
