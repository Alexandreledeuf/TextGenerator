Summer season brings us very hot weather
But the days cool again when it departs
Hear the birds and all the butterflies stir
Summer season brings us very hot weather
There is fun and lots of sun and showers
We'll see sunshine very bright for most part
Summer season brings us very hot weather
But the days cool again when it departs.
