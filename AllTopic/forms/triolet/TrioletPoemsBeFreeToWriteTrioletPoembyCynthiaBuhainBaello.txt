Be free to write, and in writing,  express
The varied thoughts and feelings you keep.
Those lessons of wisdom, never suppress,
Be free to write, and in writing, express.
Writing's a gift,  paint with words images,
And the Art itself gives a joy you reap.
Be free to write, and in writing,  express
Varied thoughts and feelings you keep.
