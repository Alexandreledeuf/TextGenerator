I walked along a winding path through an ancient wood
Where a carpet of autumn leaves I trod crumpled underfoot
That squirrels who gathered winter nuts fully understood
I walked along a winding path through an ancient wood
Squirrels gather all their food and in secret were hidden good
With sparrows and nightingale’s watching wondering what’s afoot
I walked along a winding path through an ancient wood
Where a carpet of autumn leaves I trod crumpled underfoot
