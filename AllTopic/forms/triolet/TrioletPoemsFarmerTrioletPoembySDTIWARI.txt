We eat food daily not giving a thought
how grown in fields, who have sweated.
Get in kitchen simply think, have bought;
we eat food daily not giving a thought.
Farmers grow things by working so hard
just give everything to us, self bear fret.
We eat food daily not giving a thought
how grown in fields, who have sweated.
