I walk in loneliness through fields of corn
Caressing the corn with my hand as I stroll
Soft wind makes sway in the early morn
I walk in loneliness through fields of corn
For I lost my sweet love now love is forlorn
She has taken everything even my very soul
I walk in loneliness through fields of corn
Caressing the corn with my hand as I stroll
