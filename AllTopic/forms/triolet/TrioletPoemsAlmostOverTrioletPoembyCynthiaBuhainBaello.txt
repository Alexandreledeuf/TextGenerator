When life's been lived, almost over,
And dreams sought for, just gone and lost.
Regrets and sorrow we find there
When life's been lived, almost over
We grasp at them, try to recover
And those we loved hurt us the most.
When life's been lived, almost over,
And dreams sought for, just gone and lost.
