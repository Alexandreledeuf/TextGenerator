Exactly what are you fighting for?  I'd like to know.
For clearly your vicious actions are defined- 'blackmail'.
A distorted agenda that has blinded you so,
Exactly what are you fighting for?  I'd like to know.
That cause so vile, so idiotic,  my words fail to flow.
Your faces all covered,  too shamed,  in life did you fail?
Exactly what are you fighting for?  I'd like to know.
For clearly your vicious actions are defined- 'blackmail'.
