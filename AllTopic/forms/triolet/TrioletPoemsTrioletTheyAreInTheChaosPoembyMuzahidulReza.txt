Triolet: They Are In The Chaos
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
After birth I see them in the chaos
Many years passed, I am now young
No change is seen in them, any case;
After birth I see them in the chaos,
I am afraid whether they have sense
To them sometimes it is my question;
After birth I see them in the chaos
Many years passed, I am now young.
