As we grow older, we fear birthdays,
Days we would rather not remember.
It tells a nearing end we'll soon face,
As we grow older, we fear birthdays.
Time's pages fall like leaves in their ways,
And we know,  no one lives forever.
As we grow older, we fear birthdays.
Days we would rather not remember.
