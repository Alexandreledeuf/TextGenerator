These thoughts of you may come and go
But the past was easy to forget.
I'm free and happy, if you must know
These thoughts of you may come and go
At last I'm me, chose this life so
Unchained, unbound, with no regrets
These thoughts of you may come and go
But the past was easy to forget.
*A triolet is a poem of only 8 lines
with a rhyme scheme ab/aa/ab/ab
The first,  fourth and seventh lines
are the same exact line. The eighth line is
the same exact line as the second.
