Waiting quietly in the soft falling rain
Rose in my hand outside the cinema
My first date stomach in knots real pain
Waiting quietly in the soft falling rain
For an hour I stood Iâ€™ll not do it again
I saw you drive past with a man in a car
Waiting quietly in the soft falling rain
Rose in my hand outside the cinema
