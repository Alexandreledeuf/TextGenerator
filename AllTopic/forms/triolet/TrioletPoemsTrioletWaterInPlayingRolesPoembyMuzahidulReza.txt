Triolet: Water
- - - - - - - - - - - -
Water falls down from mountain
Makes spring, lake, pond and river;
Finally rushes to the ocean;
Water falls down from mountain
Flows through rough and plane
Supplying essence to human ever;
Water falls down from mountain
Makes spring, lake, pond and river.
