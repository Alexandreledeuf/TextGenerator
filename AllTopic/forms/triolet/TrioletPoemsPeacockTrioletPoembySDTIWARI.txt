Taken from rainbow colors of your wing,
silken feathers; symbol of pride and glory.
Fly with hop, can't stay long in the wind,
taken from rainbow colors of your wing.
Your dance inspires us but never you sing,
in your beautiful feathers, lies whole story.
Taken from rainbow colors of your wing,
silken feathers; symbol of pride and glory.
