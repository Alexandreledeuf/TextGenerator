So the steering wheel showed a ship
in my dad's coupe from years ago.
Cars in boys' mind-brakes just won't slip
so the steering wheel showed a ship.
The fresh-minted smell! Brewed-air sip!
Glow-flown style; blur-torn, roam-wild show!
So the steering wheel showed a ship
in my dad's coupe from years ago!
