I think we’ll need a tourniquet
to stem the weeping wounds of Schmaltz.
He’s fading Madame Rondelet;
I think we’ll need a tourniquet.
Vers Libre scribbles epithets
extolling improvised assaults!
I think we’ll need a tourniquet
to stem the weeping wounds of Schmaltz.
We’ll raise him yet
dear Triolet but first – a waltz!
We’ll raise him yet;
I’ve found a length of winceyette.
We’ll bind the gushes, splint the faults
and bring him round with smelling salts;
we’ll raise him yet!
