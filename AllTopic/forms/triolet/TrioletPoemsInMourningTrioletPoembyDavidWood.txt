Young widow stands at the foot of a grave
Her love taken in his prime by an awful disease
Now all alone in a world trying to be brave
Young widow stands at the foot of a grave
With tears overflowing sheâ€™s unable to save
And fatherly figure tries to put her at ease
Young widow stands at the foot of a grave
Her love taken in his prime by an awful disease
