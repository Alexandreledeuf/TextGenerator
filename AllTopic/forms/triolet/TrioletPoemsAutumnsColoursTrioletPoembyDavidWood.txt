Autumn’s colours of russet red and golden brown
Lying on country paths they carpet the floor
Greet people coming out from the town
Autumn’s colours of russet red and golden brown
The beauty of nature wearing a diamond crown
A final burst of glory for all to adore
Autumn’s colours of russet red and golden brown
Lying on country paths they carpet the floor
