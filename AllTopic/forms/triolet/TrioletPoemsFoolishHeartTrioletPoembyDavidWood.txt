Fair love what do you want with my poor heart
Have you come to taunt and play with me
To lead me on then quickly to depart
Fair love what do you want with my poor heart
Will you take my love then tear it apart
And leave making me fool for all to see
Fair love what do you want with my poor heart
Have you come to taunt and play with me
