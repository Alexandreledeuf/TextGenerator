Our youth has now faded with winged feet
And age has lined our weary face with sighs
The mirror does not lie nor does it cheat
Our youth has now faded with winged feet
Time ends and Death we will soon greet
And will take us by the hand to our demise
Our youth has now faded with winged feet
And age has lined our weary face with sighs
