Two doves at the well on Valentine's Day
Oh,  how she envied their sheer happiness!
They remind her of him who had gone away
Two doves at the well on Valentine's Day.
Promises and vows are easy to say,
A heart once broken just beats in distress.
Two doves at the well on Valentine's Day
Oh,  how she envied their sheer happiness!
