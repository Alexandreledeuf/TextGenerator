A festival of  brotherhood, love and joy,
Celebrating Christmas, everyone enjoy.
Angels come down, to inspect the fiesta,
A festival of  brotherhood, love and joy.
Jesus sends blessings, on his birthday,
Santa  brings gifts, coming all the way.
A festival of  brotherhood, love and joy,
Celebrating Christmas, everyone enjoy.
