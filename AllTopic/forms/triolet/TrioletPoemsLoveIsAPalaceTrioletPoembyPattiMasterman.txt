Love is a palace that's so far away,
We ride there on horses nobody has seen;
Leaped over their paddock and then went astray,
Love is a palace that's so far away.
Our hair streaming out, as forgotten the day,
On wild horses we go where we've never yet been;
Love is a palace that's so far away,
We ride there on horses nobody has seen.
