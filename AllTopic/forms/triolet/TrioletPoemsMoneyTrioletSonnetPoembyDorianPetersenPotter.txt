Money comes and money goes
And that is the way it is so
Be aware all the time that yes
Money comes and money goes
At times we have lots some times less
And with it just reap what we sow
Money comes and money goes
And that is the way it is so
So don't worry long toss your stress
Money comes and money goes
Keep life simple rid of excess
If you don't want more debts now
Money comes and money goes
And that is the way it is so.
