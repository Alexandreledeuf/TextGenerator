Care for the little children, strive to guide their way.
They are the future citizens of a country.
Like malleable clay molded by our hands today,
Care for the little children, strive to guide their way.
Be discrete,  let us choose the words we say,
All these registered and stored in their memory
Care for the little children, strive to guide their way.
They are the future citizens of a country.
