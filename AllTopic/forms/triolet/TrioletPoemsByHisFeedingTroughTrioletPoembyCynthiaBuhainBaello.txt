Joy of the world was born in the quiet of night
Hope for all men, LORD of this Earth!
When He came as man, God of Truth and Light,
Joy of the world was born in the quiet of night.
By His feeding trough He would give men sight
As Living Bread, feed hungry souls with rebirth
Joy of the world was born in the quiet of night
Hope for all men, LORD of this Earth!
