I looked through eyes, were never cruel;
O, but their looking long was naught!
Though people may have thought me fool,
I looked through eyes, were never cruel
All that for loneliness, was my school;
And by no friends, were ever sought:
I looked through eyes, were never cruel-
O, but their looking long was naught!
