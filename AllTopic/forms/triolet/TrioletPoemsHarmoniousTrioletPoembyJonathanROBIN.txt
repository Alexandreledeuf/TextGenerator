Who’d flow through harmony no rage
should know, nor need safe haven seek,
no anger [l]inking daily page.
Who’d flow through harmony no rage
should breed, enroll, fear soul in cage,
should heedless channel tension’s [s]peak.
Who’d flow through harmony no rage
should know, nor need safe haven seek.
