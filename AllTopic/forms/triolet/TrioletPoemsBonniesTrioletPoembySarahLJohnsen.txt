She was my Lily.  Of the morning dew
She was my fragrant rhapsody in spring.
In dancing dreams in springs too few
She was my Lily of the morning dew.
Waving in wispy winds and through
Her graceful dance and gentle soul I sing:
She was my Lily of the morning dew.
She was my fragrant rhapsody, in spring.
