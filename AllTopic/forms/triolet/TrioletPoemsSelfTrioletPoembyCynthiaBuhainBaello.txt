Self's the king that sits on the throne
Of the heart,  and rules Character.
Dictates the ways a man has known,
Self's the king that sits on the throne.
It is Ego, 'you' when alone,
And you choose to hold its power.
Self's the king that sits on the throne
Of the heart, and rules of character.
