I didn’t know when we married I married a shrew
That love would need many a sticking plaster
We argue and bicker and now love’s lost its glue
I didn’t know when we married I married a shrew
How can I change her I just don’t know what to do
Our marriage at present seems to be one big disaster
I didn’t know when we married I married a shrew
That love would need many a sticking plaster
