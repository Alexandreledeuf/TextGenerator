Like rainbows dissolving or love's end
We mourn the parting of friends
As the Sun travels East to West
Do we wonder where or when it will rest
In the Spring a world reborn
A child's first step this Summer's morn
Autumn's passing into Winter's night
Shows a glimmer of Heaven's light
And slowly ticks the clock and chimes
As in passing beats our time.
