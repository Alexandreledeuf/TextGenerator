The flowers are now shattered
Their thorns bleed the rose
A Basket full of withered Daisies
Where the wild sunflower still grows;
'Tis a backfall of listless last days
Oh, the grey simply swallows you
Gone are the blistering days of Summer
As Autumns amber breaks in anew;
The shadows growing e'er longer
Gold and russet leaves fly away
Surounded by temporary graves for the Tulip
No where for the Meadow Lark to play;
The morn ' air carries its crispness
While the dew, too soon, becomes frost
Woeful cries stir from all of Nature
In mourning, for Summer Days, now lost;
November 2,2011
