Deep down me,
Recedes a voice,
Gone with it's poise,
An echo of a knight,
A relentless warrior,
Fought peacfully on his will's behalf,
Thought gregariously to mend the world,
Feigned by the beauty,
Torn by the harsh reality,
Lost his eccentricity.
Oh! there recedes the voice,
Voice of the dumb,
Left with it's flesh and bone,
Borne to mourn,
Tears alone to drown the soul,
Receded the voice,
Dumped me heartless, painless,
To face the crooked world.
