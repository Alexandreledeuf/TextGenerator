You were my constant companion
You were my faultless friend
You were my unfailing guide
You were my timely whip!
You were thick and you were thin
You saw me in my thick and thin!
You were fed once a month
You fed me all through the month!
You helped many a friend of mine
You rushed to the unknown strangers too!
You have seen my days of light and dark
You have warned me lest I went astray!
Now you are gone where I do not know!
Is it I could not satisfy your thirst
Is it you could not see me burst
Is it because I did not obey your command
Is it because I did not satisfy your demand?
How nice you were to see
How lovely you were to me
How good you were to touch
How kind you were as such!
You taught me value of things
You taught me sense of thrift
You taught me nature of men
You taught me joy of life
Now you are gone to destination unknown!
How you chose to leave me alone
How you chose to be with anon?
What on earth can move without thee
Where  can I move sans thy company?
You were a part of my daily attire
You have left me desolate
Oh! I can not stand isolate!
Such is my love for my LOST PURSE
Much is to be said of what I nurse!
I stand in loss and agony
I look before and after
I pine for what is gone!
May be He wants me more careful
May be I stand compensated
When it will be one has to guess!
May you be of help wherever you are
May you be of guide with whosoever you are!
