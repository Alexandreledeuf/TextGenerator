When clouds cry it's not because they're sad
Rather it is because they are content
That most lovers have the right intent
When clouds cry it's not because they're sad
Rather it is because they are content
When clouds cry it's not because they're sad
Seeing lovers they realise things aren't bad
Rather it is because they are content
When clouds cry it's not because they're sad
Rather it is because they are content
That most lovers have the right intent
When clouds cry it's not because they're sad
