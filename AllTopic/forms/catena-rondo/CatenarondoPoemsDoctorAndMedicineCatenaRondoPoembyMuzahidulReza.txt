Doctor And Medicine - Catena Rondo
February 27, 2020
Take proper medicine and try to be cured
You are sick
You are weak
Take proper medicine and try to be cured,
Nowadays chemical is used everywhere
In food, in drink
In weapons, in link
Nowadays chemical is used everywhere,
Again a numbers of medicines are so fake
Can not cure disease
But worsen disease
Again a numbers of medicines are so fake,
The doctors prescribe wrong medicines
Having some bribe
Having some prize
The doctors prescribe wrong medicines,
Again doctors can't diagnose diseases
Prescribe wrong medicines
But take so much fees
Again doctors can't diagnose diseases,
Take proper medicine and try to be cured
You are sick
You are weak
Take proper medicine and try to be cured.
