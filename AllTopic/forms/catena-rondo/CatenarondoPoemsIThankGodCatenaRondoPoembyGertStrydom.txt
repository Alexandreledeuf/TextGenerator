I thank God for the infinite blue sky,
for every day that is truly amazing,
for tiny birds fluttering on a wing,
I thank God for the infinite blue sky,
for every day that is truly amazing
for living on this big old mother earth
where every day is to something a birth,
for every day that is truly amazing
for living on this big old mother earth,
for existing here and merely being
in times of winter and during the spring,
for living on this big old mother earth
for existing here and merely being
I thank God for the infinite blue sky
for the look of care and love in your eye,
for existing here and merely being,
I thank God for the infinite blue sky,
for every day that is truly amazing,
for tiny birds fluttering on a wing,
I thank God for the infinite blue sky.
