Every Day - Catena Rondo
February 26, 2020
Every day I need eat
I do work
I do walk
Every day I need eat,
Every day I need sleep
For some hours
For body restores
Every day I need sleep,
Without eating I can't live
Without working can't be fit
Without walking can't be fit
Without eating I can't live,
I live in society
Every day I meet
Every day I chat
I live in society,
I live in county
Every day I do duty
Have much responsibility
I live in county,
Every day I need eat
I do work
I do walk
Every day I need eat.
