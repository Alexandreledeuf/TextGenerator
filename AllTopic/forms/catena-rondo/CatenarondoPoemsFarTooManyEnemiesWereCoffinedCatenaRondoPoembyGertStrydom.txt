Far too many enemies were coffined in
battle tanks, armoured cars shot out
and in the roar I could not hear myself shout;
far too many enemies were coffined in
battle tanks, armoured cars shot out,
far too many enemies were coffined in
the endless din, in walls of steel and tin;
battle tanks, armoured cars shot out.
Far too many enemies were coffined in
battle tanks, armoured cars shot out
and in the roar I could not hear myself shout;
far too many enemies were coffined in.
