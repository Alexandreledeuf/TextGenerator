The sun does shine upon the reeds.
The lake glistens; a twinkling dance;
On the hills, we three entranced.
The sun does shine upon the reeds.
The lake glistens; a twinkling dance.
Under water breathes like air.
We dip our heels, submerged, we dare.
The lake glistens; a twinkling dance.
Under water breathes like air.
A silvery light consumes the sun.
Deeper down, search we as one.
Under water breathes like air.
A silvery light consumes the sun.
A cottage calls from another shore;
The dark inside, yawns from the door.
A silvery light consumes the sun.
A cottage calls from another shore.
Where is Seamus? We come poking-
Through the rafters smoke is choking.
A cottage calls from another shore.
Where is Seamus? We come poking-
Woman shrouds us with her stare
As she steps to here from there.
Where is Seamus? We come poking-
Woman shrouds us with her stare.
No words are spoken with her talk,
''Round the back, where shore meets loch.'
Woman shrouds us with her stare.
No words are spoken with her talk.
Through the door, again we flow.
Did she expect us? Did she know?
No words are spoken with her talk.
Through the door, again we flow;
On the rock, the old man spies.
His bearded portal not surprised,
Through the door, again we flow.
On the rock, the old man spies.
We blink for morsels from the deep-
He sweeps his hand without a peep.
On the rock the old man spies.
We blink for morsels from the deep-
'To that boat on yonder moor,
There we stand at vision's door.'
We blink for morsels from the deep-
To that boat on yonder moor,
There's a gift for us in hand;
A gift from him to our three hearts and
To that boat on yonder moor.
There's a gift for us in hand;
Rope with no start and no result;
As round as sunshine, without fault.
There's a gift for us in hand.
Rope with no start and no result.
We equal four, we grasp this ring-
A round abyss between us clings.
Rope with no start and no result.
We equal four, we grasp this ring.
The boat's adrift with vaporous girth;
We see below another earth!
We equal four, we grasp this ring.
The boat's adrift with vaporous girth.
What's this? So misty through the dream-
We fly above this patchwork scheme!
The boat's adrift with vaporous girth.
What's this? So misty through the dream.
The sky below with clouds and hence
What's up is down. It makes no sense!
What's this? So misty through the dream.
The sky below with clouds and hence
The old man smiles, three more mixed up!
This, perhaps, may be enough!
The sky below with clouds and hence
The old man smiles, three more mixed up.
At water's edge we dock and then
Our time with him is at an end.
The old man smiles, three more mixed up.
At water's edge, we dock and then
We three stretch legs upon the lands,
Back up the hills to familiar stands.
At water's edge, we dock and then
We three stretch legs upon the lands.
The sun is shining on the reeds.
Up through the silvery lake of seeds
We three stretch legs upon the lands.
The sun does shine upon the reeds.
The lake glistens; a twinkling dance;
On the hills, we three entranced.
The sun does shine upon the reeds.
