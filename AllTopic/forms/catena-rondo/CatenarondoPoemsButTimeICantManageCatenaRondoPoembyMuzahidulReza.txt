But Time I Can't Manage - Catena Rondo
February 26, 2020
You offer much talk time
But time I can't manage
Having works huge
You offer much talk time,
I start from early morn
I have Wash first
Prayers follow it
I start from early morn,
I have some food
In short time
In very short time
I have some food,
Then I start working
Full duties wait for me
Enough responsibility
Then I start working,
When I get free
I see dead of night
I see all at sleep
When I get free,
You offer much talk time
But time I can't manage
Having works a huge
You offer much talk time.
