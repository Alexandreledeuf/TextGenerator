Love is something that you cannot remove
quite suddenly you know, she knows it too
it is in everything that you say and do,
love is something that you cannot remove
quite suddenly you know, she knows it too,
it is the very quaintest kind of thing
that to you both is suddenly happening
quite suddenly you know, she knows it too,
it is the very quaintest kind of thing
when sense and sensibility brings
to your actions, thoughts and your feelings wings
it is the very quaintest kind of thing
when sense and sensibility brings
a secret understanding that is true,
sincerity that encompass both of you
when sense and sensibility brings
a secret understanding that is true,
when a look carries a message to both
that goes much further than any oath
a secret understanding that is true,
when a look carries a message to both
when the body reacts to a single touch
when pre-comprehension says very much
when a look carries a message to both
when the body reacts to a single touch
when life seems so much greater than it is,
when mere company is full of much bliss
when the body reacts to a single touch,
when life seems so much greater than it is,
when a bond develops around the divine,
selfless you loose the own me and mine
when life seems so much greater than it is,
when a bond develops around the divine
where although separate, you become one,
without each other hardly want to live on
when a bond develops around the divine
where although separate, you become one;
love is something that you cannot remove,
to each other you do not have to prove
where although separate, you become one,
love is something that you cannot remove
quite suddenly you know, she knows it too
it is in everything that you say and do,
love is something that you cannot remove.
