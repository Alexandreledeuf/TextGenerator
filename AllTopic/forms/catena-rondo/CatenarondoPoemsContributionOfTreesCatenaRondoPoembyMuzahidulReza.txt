The trees give much, more
Flower and fruit
Leaf and Wood
The trees give much, more;
Oxygen they breathe out
Elements for survival
On that live animals
Oxygen they breathe out,
They are causes of rain
More trees where
Much rain there
They are causes of rain,
The trees give much, more
Flower and fruit
Leaf and Wood
The trees give much, more.
