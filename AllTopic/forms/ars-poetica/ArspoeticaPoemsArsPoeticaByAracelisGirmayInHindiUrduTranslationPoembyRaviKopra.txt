Allah karay
nazmaiN ghongay ki pag-dandi bun jaaiN.
jahaN bhi main jaaooN,
har inch: chup-chaap patta cHod jaaiN
mere pairoN ki chaandi ki duaaiN.
main zinda tha ek baar.
aap ka baDa shukriya.
yahaan tha, yahaan tha main ek baar.

Ars Poetica
Aracelis Girmay
May the poems be
the little snail's trail.
Everywhere I go,
every inch: quiet record
of the foot's silver prayer.
I lived once.
Thank you.
It was here.
