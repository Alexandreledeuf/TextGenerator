(It's been done. That makes it harder to do.)
Don't lock yourself in a room with a word called 'Poetry' -
It will breathe all the Oxygen.
Instead, recognize that the word is the room.
And that room is the world.
Don't try to hunt it with bow and spear-point -
It will only laugh at you, escaping
as the air escapes the clapping man.
Instead, laugh with it -
and escape with it also.
In your anger, don't even try to step on it -
it will disappear, but not for the reasons you thought.
Do not follow it, neither let it follow you.
Instead, be with it.
And it will be where it belongs.
