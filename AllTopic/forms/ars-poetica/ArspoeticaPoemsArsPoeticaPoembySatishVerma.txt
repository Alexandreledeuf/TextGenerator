1.
You don't have to walk
in self-discipline
and abstention.
To transcend
the prying eyes and
rub off the naked shoulder
of moon.
2.
Would you come back
in dark to light the lamps
in my eyes?
I need no pain
to write the epitaph of
an undying poet
in jungle of wild screams.
3.
There was no beginning
no end. So from where
you will start reciting
the beautiful saga?
I don't think of your
luxury to pick up my craft
and hack me to hundred stanzas.
