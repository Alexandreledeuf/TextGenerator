Night, day, words work will's wondrous way,
translating into light
threads at play that more threads lay
seed phrases feed fresh flight.
Weaving in, weeding out,
follow authentic cue
avoiding shout, rant roundabout,
artificial glue,
Writer's violin underpins
emotions ringing true,
poetic string soon second skin
becomes, neâ€™er dumb, askew.
