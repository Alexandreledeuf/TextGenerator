I.
Poetry is taking a blind man
and trying to describe the rainbow to him
using no adjectives.
II.
The Poet walks into a dark room
and paints the air white...
or at least attempts to
while the whales eat him whole
and recreate him again.
III.
The muses and the poet,
locked in a game of baseball,
forget that the poet must die
and forever they linger,
haunting students
with a bigger picture.
