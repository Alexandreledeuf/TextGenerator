My eyes are in trance
whenever I am with you,
In you.
I float like a snowflake and I hit the cold water
We become one
I become none.
But whenever I think of you
with my mind,
I am above you,
far far away from the essence of you
I swim in the deep blue
of the sky
so enchanting
so ephemeral
so long lasting
the illusion
of knowing what is true.
I must close my eyes and try very hard
not to think
but to feel
