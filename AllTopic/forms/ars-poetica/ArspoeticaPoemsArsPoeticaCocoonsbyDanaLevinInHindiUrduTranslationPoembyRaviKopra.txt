monarch titli k cHay koyay
tumharay gallay main phansay huay hain -
tum un k sunheri kaanptay paankh
gallay main mehsoos kar rahey ho
Khof se bhar jaatay ho tum
lagata hai galla bhara hua hai koyoN se
seeDiyoN k neechay ghar k gusal khanay main
ghalla kholay tum unaiN nikaal rahay ho thooktay huay
sunaaee deti hai fir tum ko ek awaaz
kehti hui: nahin nahin, nikaalo tum in ko nahin -

Ars Poetica (cocoons)
Dana Levin
Six monarch butterfly cocoons
clinging to the back of your throat—
you could feel their gold wings trembling.
You were alarmed. You felt infested.
In the downstairs bathroom of the family home,
gagging to spit them out—
and a voice saying Don't, don't—
