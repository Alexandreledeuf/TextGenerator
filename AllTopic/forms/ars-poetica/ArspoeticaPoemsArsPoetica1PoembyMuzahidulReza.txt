Ars Poetica # 1

A poem should sound meditation
In my brain,
As I am standing in front of a pole
As a mole,
Top of which three hands of a clock
Whirling quick,
It is an ancient and only unit
Of counting it;
The time of this universe
Time of creatures;
One after another the three hands
Count of happening things,
When start a thing and a being
Again end in time,
When did I come in this earth?
Instantly it wrote;
How much time the earth takes
To move once,
Around itself and the sun
At how motion,
From the creation of this universe
Time has been prose and verse
To the creations and the creatures
To complete course.
