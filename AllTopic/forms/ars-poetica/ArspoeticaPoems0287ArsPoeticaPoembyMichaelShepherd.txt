A poem should be -
stop right there, chum. You’ve hit
the target in four words.
see it there? Like the
Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis,
like a simile,
flashing through the mind,
reshaping the heavens,
soaring merrily above
should-be-s and shouldn’t-be-s
and - not even like I’ve said.
like nothing else
except itself
poetica my ars
a poet should be
a poem should be.
