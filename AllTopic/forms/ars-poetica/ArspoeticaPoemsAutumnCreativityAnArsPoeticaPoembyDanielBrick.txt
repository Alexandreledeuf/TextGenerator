There is a tiredness in this hot
autumn air, a drift toward sleep
even in the daylight. But sleeping
is no solution. Is it the body crying
for healing, or the soul crying for comfort?
Or perhaps both body and soul, severed
from company with the mind, yearn to close
that gap and restore their three-fold unity.
Which cry should I answer first?
Shall I summon dreamless sleep
so that the body may curl into its own
comfort and in deep unconsciousness
regain its strength? Afterwards, I will
occupy that amorphous expanse within
where nocturnal currents fold and unfold
and define the contours of the invisible soul.
Words will pour forth from the mind
and coalesce into incipient poems, taking
place within body and soul, and be shaped
according to the soil of their origins,
those of body filled with the energy
of earth, those of soul imbued with the grace
of heaven. And the mind is the guardian
of this creativity in its three-fold unity.
