There's the marble bench halfway
down the Azalea Way, and nearby
in a white leaf magnolia, a single
silk veil was left as a love token.
Three sparrows perch high above,
they display no impatience
about the human drama yet
to unfold. A block away, at a busy
coffee shop, a man and a woman share
gleeful intimacies over espresso and cream.
