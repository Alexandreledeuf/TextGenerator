Poetry is a draught
The words of the mind
The feelings of the heart
Of awe, appreciation and others of it's kind
All mixed together
To form a potion of words
It's been here forever
More powerful than guns and swords
The quill has a power
That stems from the mind
To make readers smile or glower
It can bring war or peace or other such impact-full times
Aye, that is the power of poetry
So beware, respect and appreciate
Tis not something learnt merely from coachery
For it stems from emotions, like love or hate
