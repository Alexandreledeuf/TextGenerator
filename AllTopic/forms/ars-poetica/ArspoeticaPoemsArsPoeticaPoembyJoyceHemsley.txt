We greet a spring-like dawning
Leading to a distinctive day.
Sonnets are having their say.
Lyrical prose brings forth the red rose
And memories of love start to sway
To the rhythm of birdsong in May.
Ars Poetica showing the way.
I'll hear you whisper in rhyme
As long as pretty bells chime
For I know you simply adore me.
You are the one in rain or sun
You are life's spiritual story
Steeped in lyrical glory.
With sweetness of birdsong in May
Ars Poetica is showing the way.
