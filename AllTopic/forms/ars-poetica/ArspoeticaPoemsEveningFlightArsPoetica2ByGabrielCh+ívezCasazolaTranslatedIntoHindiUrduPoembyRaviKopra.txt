aaj duniya ka axis muD gaya hai
saat centimeter tak
baaeN ya daaeN kis ko pata hai is ka
lakin aaj raat shaaer log baDay bechain se hain
aur jootay apne nikal kar dariya main ghusay hue hain
aur paani main taroN ko pakaD rehay hain.

Evening Flight / Ars Poetica 2
Gabriel Ch√°vez Casazola
Translated from the Spanish by Morgan Harden
Today the axis of the world has moved ten centimeters
to the left or right who knows
but tonight the poets wander unsettled
and throw off their shoes
and enter the river
and lay themselves out
to capture
the splendor
of the stars
to capture them
with their hands
in the water.
