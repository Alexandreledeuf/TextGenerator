I met my Muse
In last night's dream!
It's not a 'he' or a 'she'
Seems it's a team!
I always thought it was some dead poet
With a yen to express....
...With artistic sensibilities........
And a need to still show it.
But what I dreamed was....
A baseball team, (9) ,
Even some back benchers,
Second stringers, relief pitchers,
In short, a small crowd.
A motley crew, (laugh out loud) ,
Tossing out suggestions.
Still dreaming, I took them for a test drive:
I asked, How shall I say, 'You are a sight for sore eyes? '
'Northern Lights, ' came the pitch,
'Compared to grey skies.'
(Not Aurora Borealis, we were all in agreement,
Too grand for the emotion of
'I'm happy to see you.')
So...... do they hang around
Waiting for my mind to settle
On wanting to communicate
Some idea I've just thought of.......?
Or, are they the ones
Who direct my attention
To the idea itself?
A guidance from above?
And I wonder what's the best way
To engage with my team.
Oh! ! ! ! ......I guess that's actually an easy call,
I'll simply announce
In a stentorian voice:
Plaaaaaaay......... ball! !
