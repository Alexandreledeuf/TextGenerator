no rhyme
no rhythm
just fragmented thoughts
caught mid air in a net
and bottled up in a cage
where the circus ringmaster
with a whip of whimsical arbitariness
tames them down
and parades them in a somewhat meaningful pattern
disciplined unruly curs
hoping that the camouflage is good enough
for them to be considered
deceptive enough to be called a poem or
something
ars poetica
an experiment at taming down
unwanted thoughts
a mere experiment into verbalising scattered
nightmares
no metre
no syllable counts     or forms
just words   meaningless horrible words
that contradict each other
laid down upon a white sheet of paper
one that might have been more useful
in making at least twelve cigarette joints
souren mondal
