Then finishing my third form I came upon words Ars Poetica
I looked to the sky with its gathering clouds and say to myself
Yes the infinite blue is good for inspiration
I feel the cool morning breeze before heat
Yes that is good to drive the imagination
I remember things that strike me throughout the day
Some memories long some short
Yes they are good topics to write about
I wonder if I will succeed in this new to me form and remember
The hardest step is the first one
Putting the pencil to the paper
