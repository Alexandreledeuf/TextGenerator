Woven words, cascading
down slopes of rhyme,
through jungles of cadence
and blanketing the atmosphere
of the voluptuous mind;
it is with these colors
I paint my opalescence
and become translucent
phosphorescent
celestial and lyrical
and eternal
immortal
Every keystroke fires
across webs of wire
fiber optic fantasy
burning nocturnes
and arias
and odes
tears, and collapse
into the radiant world
of relentless wonder,
ineffable realm of lucidity,
of pageantry,
of swooning possibility
that we call
'the internet'.
