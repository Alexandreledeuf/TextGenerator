Daily our love does somehow increase
with some gentle ease you charmingly smile
and a while feelings linger and do not cease
and I have peace as I travel mile by mile
while nothing can beguile the joy you bring
as love is happening and you become part of me
and I am free as the birds that happily sing
free from every sting as life is what it has to be.
