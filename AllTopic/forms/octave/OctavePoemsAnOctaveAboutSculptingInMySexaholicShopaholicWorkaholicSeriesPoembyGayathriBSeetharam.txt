An Octave about sculpting in my Sexaholic Shopaholic Workaholic series

Expressing my sexual ardour in different ways, I sculpted and baked an edible man with an aroused male organ
For in my boudoir as a Sexaholic, I have chosen privacy but openness of heart
My and my husband's bete noir is being surprised at the wrong time by our son
Besides, I have said Au Revoir to my husband's playing hard to get-act;
As a Shopaholic, I love to focus on my attire
But also lay bare my purse a little shopping for artistic and sculpting materials
For lots and lots and lots of the same thing bores me
And I did acquire as a Workaholic, by dint of hard work,6 good sculptures made by myself.
