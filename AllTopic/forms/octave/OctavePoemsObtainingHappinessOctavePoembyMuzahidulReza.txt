(Obtaining Happiness: Octave)
Our mortal bodies seek happiness
With which the earth is connected less,
Happiness is concerned with immortality
And so it is heavenly,
In immortal life it may be gained
For that first here must be signed
And the conditions must be followed
Then there it can be obtained.
