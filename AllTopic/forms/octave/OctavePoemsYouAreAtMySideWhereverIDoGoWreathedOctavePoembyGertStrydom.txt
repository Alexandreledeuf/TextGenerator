You are at my side wherever I do go,
in times of woe and of great bliss,
in each kiss of our love I do know
and we do glow in the way that it is,
I do miss you when you are gone,
as you are the one that brings me joy,
as a boy and a girl daily we do atone
as life goes on, we love without any ploy.
