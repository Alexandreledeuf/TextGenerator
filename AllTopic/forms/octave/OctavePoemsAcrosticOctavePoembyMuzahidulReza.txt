A-crostic, a great form of writing poems
C-onsidering all forms, it seems to be easy
R-eaders and writers that both know,
O-nly the order of the letters of taken word
S-oundly and suitably writers will take words
T-echniques, to say are no more;
I-mportance should be given on that
C-ritical comments can be written on it.
