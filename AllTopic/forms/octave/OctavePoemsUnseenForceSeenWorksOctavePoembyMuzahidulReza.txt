Unseen air comes in and gets out of us
Doing some seen internal vital works
Supplying oxygen and removing poisons
Are among those life saving necessaries
Without causing problems but leaving thoughts
That catch the brain, swell heart and veins
With every entering and getting out breaths
Which a general brain can hardly guess.
