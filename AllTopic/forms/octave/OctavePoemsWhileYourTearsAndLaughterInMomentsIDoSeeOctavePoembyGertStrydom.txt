Love is like the air that we breathe in invisible
but always around us it does maintain life,
where the effects of it is visible
in words and acts and in all that we do strive
and distance is something that does rob you from me,
where longing is something straight from hell,
while your tears and laughter in moments I do see
that does about the depth of your feelings tell.
