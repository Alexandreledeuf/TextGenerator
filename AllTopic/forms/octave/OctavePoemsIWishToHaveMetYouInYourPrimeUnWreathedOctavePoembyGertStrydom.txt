I wish to have met you in your youth and prime,
at a time when the things we do
are true as is reason to rhyme,
as now I see great qualities in you
as life takes its course, as to life we bow,
and kindness you do bestow and as my wife,
you make me alive and in happiness you do glow
in a world that is at times full of strive.
