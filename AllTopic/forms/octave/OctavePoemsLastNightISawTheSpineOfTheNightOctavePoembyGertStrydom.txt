Last night I saw the spine of the night,
I saw stars glow, glitter and jump far away
I did wonder about a God, who creates pure light,
who comes with deliverance to those who stray.
Still the earth revolves on a set orbit
and He is preparing to come back again
while to utter sin the world falls bit by bit
and the day of His judgement does remain.
