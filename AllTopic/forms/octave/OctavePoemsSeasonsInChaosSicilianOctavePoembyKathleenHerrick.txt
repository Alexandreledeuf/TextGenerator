Season of chaos now comes to my world
Wandering through dusty days, rainy nights,
Changes from green to gold, quick unfurled
Buds now dropping in death before my sight,
Soon chaos cocoons the earth in it's pearl
Blanket of frozen tears, blindingly light,
Even at dusk all is a twinkle twirl
Delight, for tulips pink await sun's bright.
