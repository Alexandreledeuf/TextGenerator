A coherent blab packed
Within a matured mind
Seeking a genuine reason
All, remoted for a season
Attempt to make a tune
Results in a pure distune
Psyche of chracteristic inferiority
Affects the dame of superiority
Tale of historics reiterates a relic
Of a damsel hitting for the cosmic.
There was a rapture
Later resulted in rupture
In a giant school of thought
Where great ants were taught
Experts a tension observed
Professionals, a  novice reserved
One without a tonic will suffer
Like song without a tonic sofa
One who wants to be first lady
Shoud first learn to be a lady.
