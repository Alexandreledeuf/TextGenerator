I try to penetrate your pleasant guise
without a bruise to be the hero,
but feel like a zero while I act somewhat wise,
without surprise the sun is hot on my sombrero
as it does glow and still you make me feel tall
and as my all in all, life has to be like this,
this is the way that it is even when I do fall,
when life makes me small and you still do me kiss.
