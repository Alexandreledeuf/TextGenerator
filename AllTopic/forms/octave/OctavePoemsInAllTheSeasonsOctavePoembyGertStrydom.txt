Throughout all the seasons of my life
my love burns like a flame in the snow
where years pass with you as my wife
and in a modern age we do come and go,
where our summer does become something holy,
even when destiny comes with utter pain,
God pours out His blessing on you and me
in days where totally speechless we do remain.
