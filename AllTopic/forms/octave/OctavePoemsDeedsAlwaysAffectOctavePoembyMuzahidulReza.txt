Deeds Always Affect (Octave)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The earth is a vast garden
In it humans are children,
Some are playing well game
But most are committing wrong,
So they are not same in acts
They are different for deeds,
So, as their positions vary here
After this period shall vary there.
