In bliss your white body glows in the dark
where streched out you lie in your sleep
as if in another world you do embark
while an arm do me close to you keep.
When the rays of the moon do over your face fall
your eyes do open slowly where in silence you look at me
in this time and place in the universe, it's you and me in it all,
while moments linger do become a kind of eternity.
