Daily I do know that you do love me
as our feelings ought to be and it does show
as you do glow as if alight constantly
and without pretence even when tears do flow
you are mine, you are in every sense,
in innocence like sparkling pure whine
you constantly shine with great competence
with a kind of love that is hard to define.
