Sometimes you seem collected and meek,
later in the week suddenly you do change
and life feels strange while I do seek
you out. With cheek, my life you do rearrange,
as we do exchange kisses and embraces,
draw funny faces, are in bliss again and again,
and without pain my heart constantly races,
as I skip to new paces and our love does remain.
