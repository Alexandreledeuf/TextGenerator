On the soil in the garden rose is a flower
As, in the royal tower is a dynastic queen
In highly royal sphere
Where princes and princesses are living
With royal softness, fragrance and color
As the butterflies flying,
Royal ladies and gentle men are moving
As drones, bees, humble bees rounding.
