Millennium developments are nothing
But some dreadful weapons inventing
Like male bomb, female bomb for the first time
To give birth bastard bombs for all the times
Loosing mere pride and anarchy
Every nook and cranny
To loose curse committing wars illegally
To finish selves finishing others awfully.
