(after Petra Müller)
I see you with the light radiating around you,
that bright glare with you hair silky-fine
in the summer-sun the rays do almost pierce through
where it looks as if it shines from you, from every line.
So innocent and holy this moment is
that in my mind the image does remain
where no mortal person can resist this
when love comes in glory, brightness and in pain.
