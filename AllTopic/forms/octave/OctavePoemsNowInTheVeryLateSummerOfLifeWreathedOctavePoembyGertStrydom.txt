Now in the very late summer of life,
you are my wife after many years
and without fears in tranquillity and strive
I am truly alive in happiness and tears
as if in arrears our true love catches on,
all heartaches are gone while without fright
our love seems right, as if set in stone,
as you are the one in every day and night.
