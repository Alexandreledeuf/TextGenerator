If we do look at things in history
no kind of rescue comes from history
and that was just another old story.
.
Peace, the government had promised me
but to war, to death they had then sent me
to set mankind from all kinds of war free.
It was bad, I was under sniper fire
saw howitzer guns open deadly fire
and we moved constantly did then tire.
Every place looked the very same
the weather, the veldt just stayed the same
but to the generals it was a game
and soldiers were sacrificed as mere pawns
in the hearts of great men where evil spawns.
