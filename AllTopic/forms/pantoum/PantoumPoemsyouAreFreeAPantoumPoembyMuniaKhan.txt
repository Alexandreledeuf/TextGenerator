I have to slay my heart’s desire
As long as your love’s far away
My love is burning in your fire
And I shall not beg you to stay
As long as your love’s far away
I need to hide my tears from you
And I shall not beg you to stay
You’re free to start a life anew
I need to hide my tears from you
For it fails to bring your love now
You’re free to start a life anew
In time you will forget your vow
For it fails to bring your love now
My love is burning in your fire
In time you will forget your vow
I have to slay my heart’s desire
