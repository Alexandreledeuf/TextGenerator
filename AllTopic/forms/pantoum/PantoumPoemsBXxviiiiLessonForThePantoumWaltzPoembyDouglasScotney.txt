The second of the first
goes to the first of the second,
the fourth of the first,
to the third.
The second of the second
goes to the first of the third,
the fourth, to the third
of the third.
The second of the third
goes to the first of the fourth,
and the fourth
goes to the third.
There are four lots of four.
To complete the waltz
of the The Irregular Pantoum
you need to know no more.
