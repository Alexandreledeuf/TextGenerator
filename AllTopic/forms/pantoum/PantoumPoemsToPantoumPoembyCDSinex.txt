I've never felt the ground swell under me
(though many times confusing love and lust)
swept off my feet, as if swept out to sea,
to lose control to feelings I don't trust.
Though many times confusing love and lust
I've wondered what it's like to not be free,
to lose control to feelings I don't trust,
and laying bare my soul for you to see.
I've wondered what it's like to not be free,
to show you all the things I fear I must,
and laying bare my soul for you to see,
or leaving all of this to turn to dust.
To show you all the things I fear I must,
swept off my feet, as if swept out to sea,
or leaving all of this to turn to dust—
I've never felt the ground swell under me.
