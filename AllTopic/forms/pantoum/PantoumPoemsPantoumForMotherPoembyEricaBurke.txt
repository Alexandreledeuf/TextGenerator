My mother, always a gentle woman,
As far as I have known,
Loves her children, loves herself,
Worked herself to the bone.
As far as I have known,
She never cheated me,
Working herself to the bone,
My mother taught to me.
She never cheated me,
Of money or life or love,
My mother has taught to me,
The best gifts are up above.
Of money or life or love,
Is what the world shall see,
Are not my gifts, for they’re above,
And that’s what my mother taught to me.
