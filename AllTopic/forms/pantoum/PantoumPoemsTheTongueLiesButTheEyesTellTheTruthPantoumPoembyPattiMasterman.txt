The tongue lies but the eyes tell the truth;
Never comes the day, that you could believe
The odd flowers, all growing from one root:
She says she'll stay, but anyway she leaves.
Never comes the day that you could believe
How different plants grow, from the same-sown seed:
She says she'll stay but anyway she leaves;
Your heart says flower, but your mind says weed.
How different plants grow from the same-sown seed,
In the bloodied pact you made, her blood was fake:
Your heart says flower but your mind says weed;
You know you still want her, though she makes you ache.
In the bloodied pact you made her blood was fake;
There's no more trust, just the carcass of lust,
You know you still want her though she makes you ache,
She says she's yours, but her words are more rust.
There's no more trust just the carcass of lust;
The odd flowers, all growing from one root
She says she's yours but her words are more rust:
The tongue lies, but the eyes tell the truth.
