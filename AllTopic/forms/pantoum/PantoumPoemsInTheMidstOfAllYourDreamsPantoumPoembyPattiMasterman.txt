In the midst of all your dreams
I tiptoe through your heart
While the stars about us gleam
I put to work my art
I tiptoe through your heart
The stars alone can see
I put to work my art
To bring your love to me
The stars alone can see
How I cast my sovereign spell
To bring your love to me
For nobody can tell
How I cast my sovereign spell
And I wrap your dreams with mine
For nobody can tell
And I do it every night
And I wrap your dreams with mine
While the stars about us gleam
And I do it every night
In the midst of all your dreams
