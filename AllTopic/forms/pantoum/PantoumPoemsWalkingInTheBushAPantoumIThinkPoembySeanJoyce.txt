Is this not beautiful, she said
this colonnade of greenery
Cicadas sing and Bellbirds ring
Above about and in between
This colonnade of greenery
Where Fantails skit and skite
Above about and in between
And water softens every sight
Where Fantails skit and skite
Delighting in our company
And water softens every sight
Yes this is beautiful indeed
Delighting in our company
Our togetherness together
Yes this is beautiful indeed
It may be paradise, she said
Our togetherness together
Cicadas sing and Bellbirds ring
It may be paradise, she said
this colonnade of greenery
