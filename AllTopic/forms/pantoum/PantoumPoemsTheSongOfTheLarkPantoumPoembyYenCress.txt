Alone, alone, I listened to a song,
The lovely, floating warble of a lark.
I heard the notes come drifting, clear and strong,
Until the daylight faded into dark.
The lovely, floating warble of a lark-
Its melody caressed my troubled soul
Until the daylight faded into dark
And velvet night concealed the gentle knoll.
Its melody caressed my troubled soul
While yet I lingered, charmed by peace and grace,
And velvet night concealed the gentle knoll
Before I left that sweet, enchanted place.
While yet I lingered, charmed by peace and grace,
I memorized each shimmering, silvery tone,
Before I left that sweet, enchanted place-
Then I was once again alone, alone.
I memorized each shimmering, silvery tone;
I heard the notes come drifting, clear and strong,
Then I was once again alone, alone.
Alone, alone, I listened to a song.
