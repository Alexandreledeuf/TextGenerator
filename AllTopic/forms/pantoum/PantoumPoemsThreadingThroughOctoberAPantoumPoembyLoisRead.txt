New England autumn shouts out loud:
Arachne goes wild with natural dyed yarns.
Brash goldenrod has gone sedate.
What shall we do when winter comes?
Arachne goes wild with natural dyed yarns
her tapestry evolving daily.
What shall we do when winter comes
with silence out companion?
Her tapestry evolving daily
she weaves with leaves and branches.
With silence our companion
we watch and wait in wonder.
She weaves with leaves and branches
a symphony of autumn.
We watch and wait in wonder
what last great chord will strike.
A symphony of autumn
threading through October
what last great chord will strike
when all the weft is spent?
Threading through October
brash goldenrod has gone sedate.
When all the weft is spent
New England autumn shouts out loud.
