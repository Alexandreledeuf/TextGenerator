It takes my breath -
your hands tangled in my hair,
the salt taste of your skin,
in candle light and clean sheets.
Your hands tangled in my hair
feel rhythms older than time,
in candlelight and clean sheets
the very force of Creation
Feel rhythms older than time -
pull me as Moon pulls the tide;
The very force of Creation
gently, hungrily, urgently
Pull me as Moon pulls tide,
with the strength of the universe
gently, hungrily, urgently
with feather touch and fire
With the strength of the universe
it takes my breath -
with feather touch and fire,
the salt taste of your skin.
