You are the only one for me,
I wrap my pillow in my arms,
When memories invade my spiritual infinity,
I start remembering those days.
I wrap my pillow in my arms,
Your face was there in moonlight,
I start remembering those days,
When your magnetic eyes were watching me.
Your face was there in moonlight,
Each every single day i lived,
When your magnertic eyes were watching me,
My heart felt safe and rich.
Each every single day i lived,
When memories invade my spiritual infinity,
My heart felt safe and rich,
You are the only one for me.
