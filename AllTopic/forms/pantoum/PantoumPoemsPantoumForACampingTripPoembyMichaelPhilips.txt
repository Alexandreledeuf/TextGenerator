I forgot the bug spray
So mosquitoes keep attacking me
Some guy brought a blender for Happy Hour
And some people even bring their TVs
So mosquitoes keep attacking me
There are too many man-made noises
And some people even bring their TVs
Which I don’t understand.
There are too many man-made noises.
The nature walk is closed
Which I don’t understand
Even though it’s not my favorite activity
.
The nature walk is closed
So I commune with the panhandling squirrels
Even though it’s not my favorite activity.
We pitched the tent next to our beloved car
So I commune with the panhandling squirrels
Someone’s bug zapper keeps me up all night
We pitched the tent next to our beloved car
Which makes camping sort of surreal.
Someone’s bug zapper keeps me up all night
That guy with the blender never went to sleep
Which makes camping sort of surreal.
The bathrooms are the real adventure.
