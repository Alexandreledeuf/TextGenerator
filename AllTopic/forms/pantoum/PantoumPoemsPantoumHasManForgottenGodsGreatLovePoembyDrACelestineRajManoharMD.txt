God’s love made man the best of all
Creatures on earth, made from same soil;
Blame sin and misery for fall
Of Adam, Eve, and Satan’s spoil!
Creatures on earth, made from same soil,
Were handed o’er to man’s control;
Of Adam, Eve, and Satan’s spoil,
Was born all evil, in man’s role!
Were handed o’er to man’s control,
Dominion o’er each creature;
Was born all evil, in man’s role,
When devils changed human nature.
Dominion o’er each creature,
God gave to man to show His love;
When devils changed human nature,
By luring man from God above.
God gave to man to show His love,
His only Son for death on cross;
By luring man from God above,
The devils bring about souls’ loss.
His only Son for death on cross
was Jesus Christ, born man on earth;
The devils bring about souls’ loss,
By tempting man to sin from birth.
Was Jesus Christ, born man on earth?
Yes, but He was Himself too, God;
By tempting man to sin from birth,
The devils bring on man, God’s rod.
Yes, but He was Himself too, God –
Redeemer of the human race;
The devils bring on man, God’s rod,
And Jesus restores man’s soul’s grace.
Redeemer of the human race,
Christ’s precious blood has paid sin’s price;
And Jesus restores man’s soul’s grace,
Now heaven is our home – Rejoice!
Christ’s precious blood has paid sin’s price;
Blame sin and misery for fall;
Now heaven is our home – Rejoice!
God’s love made man, the best of all.
