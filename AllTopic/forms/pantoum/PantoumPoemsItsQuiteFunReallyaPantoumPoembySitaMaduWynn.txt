Its quite fun really,
To pen this down,
Am writing a pantoum,
You’re reading it as well.
To pen this down,
Is not hard at all,
You’re reading it as well,
You should know what I mean
Is not hard at all,
It’s got a unique style,
You should know what I mean,
Like writing in circles.
It’s got a unique style,
With a rhythmic pattern,
Like writing in circles,
Repeating lines often.
Now sitting in my study,
Am writing a pantoum,
And I just have to say -
Its quite fun really!
