Insistent heavy throb of daylight passed
The sweated flora scented sunburnt air
The clarity of night transpired at last
The hunter shunned the radiating glare
The sweated flora scented sunburnt air
He watched the flickered furtiveness of night
The hunter shunned the radiating glare
A tissued wisp of wing eclipsed soft light
He watched the flickered furtiveness of night
Across the hanging moon's reflective gaze
A tissued wisp of wing eclipsed soft light
He felt an angel's fluctuating phrase
Across the hanging moon's reflective gaze
A hint of pink in bone-white watered silk
He felt an angel's fluctuating phrase
He felt enfolding hands as smooth as milk
A hint of pink in bone-white watered silk
A reflex startle soothed by calm embrace
He felt enfolding hands as smooth as milk
The pain was brief and bright as lightning's trace
A reflex startle soothed by calm embrace
The needle teeth released the dunnart's spark
The pain was brief and bright as lightning's trace
The ghost bat fed and wheeled to caverned dark
The needle teeth released the dunnart's spark
The clarity of night transpired at last
The ghost bat fed and wheeled to caverned dark
Insistent heavy throb of daylight passed
