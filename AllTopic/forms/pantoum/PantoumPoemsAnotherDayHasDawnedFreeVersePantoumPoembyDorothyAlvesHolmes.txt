The sea had shown me mercy
Purple twilight hid my angry, heart-break tears.
The pink horizon shimmered across my dreams.
Dreams lay abandoned on an island of woeful fears.
Purple twilight hid my angry, heart-break tears.
My heart ached to paint paisley waters of love again.
Dreams lay abandoned on an island of woeful fears.
Perfumed passion waned; I was marooned, without you.
My heart ached to paint paisley waters of love again.
I stood looking out at the sea as her waves frolicked.
Perfumed passion waned; I was marooned, without you
Roar of the sea echoed your laughter; your smile haunted me.
I stood, looking out at the sea as her waves frolicked,
All around me, I saw shadows of your perfect face.
Roar of the sea echoed your laughter; your smile haunted me.
Clouds of loneliness invaded my space at nightfall.
All around me, I saw shadows of your pefect face
Why was I abandoned, on this island of desolate longing?
Clouds of loneliness invaded my space at nightfall.
Who will find me, lost here, within this pitty-full shell?
Why was I abandoned, on this island of desolate longing?
I was awakened by an invasive early bright orange sunrise!
Who will find me, lost here, within this pitty-full shell?
I turned to run away from the intrusion of sunrise screaming!
I was awakened by an invasive early bright orange sunrise!
A smile from within me cracked the walls of dismay.
I turned to run away from the intrusion of sunrise screaming!
Upon the shore a precious pearl spilled, resting at my feet.
A smile from within me cracked the walls of dismay.
The pink horizon shimmered across my dreams.
Upon the shore a precious pearl spilled, resting at my feet.
The sea had shown me mercy.
