Winter's long days are almost done
Though furrowed fields lie dormant still
Overhead shines a gentle sun
Its promise of spring yet to fill
Though furrowed fields lie dormant still
Waiting for that warmth from above
Its promise of spring yet to fill
The young buds are forced from their glove
Waiting for that warmth from above
Tender shoots of green now appear
The young buds are forced from their glove
Assured that spring is almost here
Tender shoots of green now appear
Overhead shines a gentle sun
Heralding spring - now so near
Winter's long days are almost done.
