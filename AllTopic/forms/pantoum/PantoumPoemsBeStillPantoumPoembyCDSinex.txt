We watch the day fade slowly into night,
in silence standing by this open gate.
Afraid, as if to speak would chase the light.
I have to go; you know it's getting late.
In silence standing by this open gate
your head pressed ever softly on my chest.
I have to go; you know it's getting late.
Why are sad things so often for the best?
Your head pressed ever softly on my chest
we both pretend that neither one can hear.
Why are sad things so often for the best?
The time for me to leave is growing near.
We both pretend that neither one can hear
afraid, as if to speak would chase the light.
The time for me to leave is growing near.
We watch the day fade slowly into night.
