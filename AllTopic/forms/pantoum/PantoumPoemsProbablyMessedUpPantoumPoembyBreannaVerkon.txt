We can work it out
Please don’t shout
Maybe its not meant to be
You’re everything to me
Please don’t shout
that’s not what this is about
You’re everything to me
Why cant you see
that’s not what this is about
Get the hell out
Why cant you see
You’re driving me crazy
Get the hell out
I’m sorry come out
You’re driving me crazy
This is insanity
I’m sorry come out
don’t be crazy
This is insanity
You’re wearing me out
don’t be crazy
You’re making me shout
You’re wearing me out
This cant be reality
don’t be crazy
Maybe its not meant to be
This cant be reality
We can work it out
