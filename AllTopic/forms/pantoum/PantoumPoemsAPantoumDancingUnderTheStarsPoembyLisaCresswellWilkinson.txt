As she dances under the moonlit stars
Feeling the adrenalin rushing through her veins
For now she is alone, but not lonely
She makes her own music as her heart beats in time
Feeling the adrenalin rushing through her veins
Passers by shoot a glance as her aura reflects
She makes her own music as her heart beats in time
She loves to perform, dancing is her life
Passers by shoot a glance as her aura reflects
For now she is alone, but not lonely
She loves to perform, dancing is her life
As she dances under the moonlit stars
