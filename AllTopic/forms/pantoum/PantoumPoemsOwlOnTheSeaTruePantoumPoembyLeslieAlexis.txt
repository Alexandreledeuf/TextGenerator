An owl soars over open sea
The fat blind bird in open range
Soars like eagles – incredibly!
He makes a scene, for he’s estranged.
The fat blind bird in open range.
The owl in the pacific air;
He makes a scene, for he’s estranged
He conquers every passing fear.
The owl in the pacific air.
The harsh sun and her seeping light;
He conquers every passing fear,
He travels both in day and night.
The harsh sun and her seeping light
Through the osprey and birds of prey
He travels both in day and night,
The fire for an all owl buffet
Through the osprey and birds of prey
An owl soars over open sea:
The fire for an all owl buffet,
Soars like eagles – incredibly!
