I dream often.
All wildly and different ideas.
All senses, feeling real.
Where reality and fantasy meet.
All wildly and different ideas,
In a scary world that I do not know.
Where reality and fantasy meet,
Creeping cautiously in this foreign land.
In a scary world that I do not know,
My body is asleep; my mind is in control,
Creeping cautiously in this foreign land,
Eventually finding pure bliss.
My body is asleep; my mind is in control,
I see the future clearly.
Eventually finding pure bliss.
Succeeding to the fullest.
I see the future clearly,
Although overcoming my fears fogged my path for awhile,
Succeeding to the fullest.
That’s what I’m going to do.
Although overcoming my fears fogged my path for awhile,
I’m back on track, right where I want to be.
That’s what I’m going to do.
Take on the world. 
I’m back on track, right where I want to be.
I dream often,
Take on the world,
All senses, feeling real.
