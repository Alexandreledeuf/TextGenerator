The bougainvillea weeps petals on the street,
cobblestones are red with tears.
Much care is needed treading cobblestones
more now that I may murder tears.
Cobblestones are red with tears:
I know not where to put my foot,
more now that I may murder tears.
Would the weeper feel pain?
I know not where to put my foot
for fear of stepping on the petals.
Would the weeper feel pain
were I to crush just one?
For fear of stepping on the petals
I walk home the long way round.
Were I to crush just one,
my heart would weep red too.
I walk home the long way round-
if I crush this crimson carpet
my heart would weep red too,
fallen flowers' blood my own.
If I crush this crimson carpet
much care is needed treading cobbles.
Fallen flowers' blood my own,
the bougainvillea weeps petals on the street.
