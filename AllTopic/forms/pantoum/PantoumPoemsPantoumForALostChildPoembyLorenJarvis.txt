You in the cold and wrapped in winter lace,
The wind with grace moves down the cheerless field.
I cannot send you sun except my heart.
My tears impede the vision of your face.
The wind with grace moves down the cheerless field.
The stones lie still as children fast asleep.
My tears impede the vision of your face.
Perhaps what was will in the spring be healed.
The stones lie still as children fast asleep.
The distance now is kept by cool embrace.
Perhaps what was will in the spring be healed,
A watering of tears can heal where love lies deep.
The distance now is kept by cool embrace.
I cannot send you sun except my heart.
A watering of tears can heal where love lies deep,
You in the cold and wrapped in winter lace.
