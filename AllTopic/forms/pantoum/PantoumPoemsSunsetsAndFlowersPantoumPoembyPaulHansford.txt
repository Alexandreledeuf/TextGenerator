('I hate sunsets and flowers. I loathe the sea; the sea is formless.' - WH Auden.
I hate sunsets and flowers;
I loathe the rolling sea.
What matter sunshine or showers?
None of it matters to me.
I loathe the rolling sea,
Where once we used to roam.
None of it matters to me.
No colours, no waves, no foam.
Where once we used to roam
It's formless now and bare.
No colours, no waves, no foam,
Because you are not there.
It's formless now and bare
Everywhere I go.
Because you are not there
Your garden's full of snow.
Everywhere I go,
What matter sunshine or showers?
Your garden's full of snow.
I hate sunsets and flowers.
