...The midnight train is coming, wailing and trailing its plaintive whistle again
...Down through all the forlorn years and down through all the midnight tears
...I hear its call come burning through the miles, come yearning down the tracks
...And I'm wondering where it's going and wondering where it's been
.
...Down through all the forlorn years and down through all the midnight tears
...I hear it calling me, galling me, following me
...And I'm wondering where it's going and wondering where it's been
...And I'm wondering should I follow or should I stay where I am
.
...I hear it calling me. galling me, following me
...Its secrets and its mysteries keep whispering in my restless dreams
...And I'm wondering should I follow or should I stay where I am
...Stay where all is known and safe or do I go a-wandering where all is unknown
.
...Its secrets and its mysteries keep whispering in my restless dreams
...Calling me to go rambling and roaming and vagabonding or stay
...Stay where all is known and safe or do I go a-wandering where all is unknown
...Train on a long lonesome journey calling me in the long wistful midnight hours
.
...Long and low the whistle comes seeking, winding through the long dark night
...I hear its call come burning through the miles, come yearning down the tracks
...Long and low it comes mourning, crying through the dark dark night
...The midnight train is coming, wailing and trailing its plaintive whistle again.
