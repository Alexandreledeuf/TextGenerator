Follow me child
Past the stillness of this land
Chase me beyond the rainbow
Farther than the eye can see
Past the stillness of this land
There lies a truth in every pain
Farther than they eye can see
The horizon stretches beyond pale
There lies a truth in every pain
A child in every soul
The horizon stretches beyond pale
Beyond the knowledge of this world
A child in every soul
Seeking answers in their quest
Beyond the knowledge of this world
Follow me child
