Sunlight bleeds through forest canopy
Slipping between my fingers
The daisies glare at me with sympathy
When crushed their scent still lingers
Slipping between my fingers
White petals soft caress
When crushed their scent still lingers
Care free, I could care less
White petals soft caress
Green blades tickle my feet
Care free, I could care less
It's nearing summer's heat
Green blades tickle my feet
Content, yet all alone
It's nearing summer's heat
Reaching for a home
Content, yet all alone
Desperately searching for what I won't find
Reaching for a home
Each breath awkwardly timed
Desperately searching for what I won't find
Sunlight bleeds through forest canopy
Each breath awkwardly timed
The daisies glare at me with sympathy
