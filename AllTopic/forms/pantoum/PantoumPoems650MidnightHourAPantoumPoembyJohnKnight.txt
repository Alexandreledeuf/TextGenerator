How precious is the midnight hour
when from our daily task we rest
sometimes refreshed by cooling shower
with starlit darkness we are blessed.
When from our daily task we rest
birds silent rest with folded wings
with starlit darkness we are blessed
the wind a sweet soft dream song sings.
Birds silent rest with folded wings
the air is filled with fragrance scent
the wind a sweet soft dream song sings
to aid our sleep is her intent.
The air is filled with fragrant scent
in slumber sweet we close our eyes
to aid our sleep is her intent
we sleep in peace 'til warm sunrise.
In slumber sweet we close our eyes
sometimes refreshed by cooling shower
we sleep in peace 'til warm sunrise
how precious is the midnight hour.
