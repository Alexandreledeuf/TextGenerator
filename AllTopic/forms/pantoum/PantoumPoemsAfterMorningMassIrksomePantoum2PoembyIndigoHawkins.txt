Be a dear, would you,
and pass an old lady her gin.
I'm tired of men, of old age and sinâ€¦
that's your cue to grin
and pass an old lady her gin.
I'll be gone before Christ comes again:
that's your cue to grin
and ask derisively, When?
I'll be gone, before. Christ comes again,
tell him I'm severely disappointed
and ask derisively, When
were you planning to inform me?
Tell him I'm severely disappointed;
I'm tired of men, of old age and sin.
Were you planning to inform me?
Be a dear. Would you?
