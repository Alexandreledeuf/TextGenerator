My mind is always going where it's not supposed to be;
I parachute through memories, that take me where they will,
And jump around through time, as though there were no history-
It's like a memory leads me right to what I used to feel.
I parachute through memories, that take me where they will;
It does no good to try and stay here safe inside the now,
It's like a memory leads me right to what I used to feel-
And staying in the present's what my mind will not allow.
It does no good to try and stay here safe inside the now.
My face is blank, I'm drooling, and can't even tell you why;
It's like a memory leads me right to what I used to feel,
One thought makes another one, and soon it is goodbye.
My face is blank, I'm drooling, and can't even tell you why.
It's always somewhere where I've been a hundred times at least;
One thought makes another one, and soon it is goodbye.
My brain is mapped in thought-forms, I know it will never cease.
It's always somewhere where I've been a hundred times at least,
And jump around through time, as though there were no history.
My brain is mapped in thought-forms, I know it will never cease;
My mind is always going where it's not supposed to be.
