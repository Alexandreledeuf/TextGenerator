i think i can see it now clear as the day
i thought and prayed he'd  love me
i wished and hoped he'd stay
now i realize that it was never meant to be.
i thought and prayed he'd love me
in the end im always alone
now i realize that it was never meant to be
my bodies chilled im frozen to the bone
in the end im always alone
tortured and broken i lay down to die
my bodies chilled, im frozen to the bone
does he even realize he's the reason i cry
tortured and broken i lay down to die
i wished and hoped he'd stay
does he even realize that he's the reason i cry
i think i can see it now as clear as day
