There's magic in the air
When Cinderella dreams;
Glass slippers may appear,
As odd as it may seem.
When Cinderella dreams
Of jaunty men on horses;
As odd as it may seem
For magic reigns, of courses
Of jaunty men on horses,
She dreams, in her little bed,
For magic reigns, of courses;
And it dances through her head.
She dreams, in her little bed
He has come to take her hand,
And it dances through her head;
She'll be Queen of the little land.
He has come to take her hand,
Glass slippers may appear;
She'll be Queen of the little land:
There's magic in the air
