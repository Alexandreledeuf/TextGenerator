When folks are mean, just let it go
In silence forgive, then move on
Sometimes is best to go with flow
Anger brings pain none good to show.
In silence forgive, then move on
Not easy, but right thing to do
Anger brings pain none good to show
Allow no one to turn your day blue.
Not easy, but right thing to do
Sometimes is best to go with flow
Allow no one to turn your day blue
When folks are mean, just let it go.
