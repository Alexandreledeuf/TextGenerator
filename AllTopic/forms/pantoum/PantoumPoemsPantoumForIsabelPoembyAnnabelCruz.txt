Isabel, so fair and sweet
Worry not your pretty head
Clap your hands and dance your feet
Flowers will grow wherever you tread
Worry not your pretty head
Laugh and sing all through the day
Flowers will grow wherever you tread
Angels will guide you if you pray
Laugh and sing all through the day
Worry not of things undone
Angels will guide you if you pray
Be not afraid of what will come
Worry not of things undone
Clap your hands and dance your feet
Be not afraid of what will come
Isabel, so fair and sweet
