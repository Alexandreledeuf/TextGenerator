The rainbow'sribbons still stretching in the blue rain
Are like snakes waking up at the tune of the jazz flutes.
Butterflies chase bumble bees singing duets in vain.
Summer dances around some red roses and green fruits.
When the snakes wake up at the tune of the jazz flutes,
Summer slips over the meadow her dream of green.
She dances around some red roses and green fruits.
The moon rises from the cloud's fence like a queen.
Summer slips over the meadow like a dream of green
In a fall sky having puffy winds and a dim light.
The moon rises from the cloud's fence like a queen.
With green shadows, the sprites appear all around the sight.
The fall sky has puffs of clouds and a floating light.
Butterflies chase bumble bees singing duets in vain.
With green shadows, the sprites appear all around the sight.
Summer rainbow's ribbon still stretches in the blue rain.
