I had two rats, to fill my days
Through spines of books and bed clothes
They chewed their lazy way
And when they saw you, froze
Through spines of books and bed clothes
Released out of their cage
And when they saw you, froze
For chewing was their rage
Released out of their cage
And when they saw you, froze
For chewing was their rage
Their pile of booty grows
And when they saw you, froze
They lurked behind the dresser
Their pile of booty grows
The cage mess is the lesser
They lurked behind the dresser
They chewed their lazy way
The cage mess is the lesser
I had two rats, to fill my days
