********************************************* ************************************
I check my electronic schedule -
Technology calls -
Notifying my teammates,
I leave my desk.
Technology calls
My hard copies in hand:
I leave my desk
My mind checking off details.
My hard copies in hand,
The box open on the table,
My mind checking off details -
Missing cord needed
The box open on the table
Back-tracking locations finds
Missing cord needed;
Connection completed.
Back tracking locations finds
Human assumptions are wrong:
Connection completed
And then released to new demands.
Human assumptions are wrong,
Must be modified, alternates quickly found
And then released to new demands,
New connections are found
Must be modified, alternates quickly found
IP addresses dictated and fed
New connections are found
True communication begins
IP addresses dictated and fed,
The telephone facilitates as
True communication begins
As video and digital merge
The telephone facilitates as
Technology calls
As video and digital merge
I leave my desk.
