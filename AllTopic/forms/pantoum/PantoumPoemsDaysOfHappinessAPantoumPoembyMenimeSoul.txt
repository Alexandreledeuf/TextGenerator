Oh return me my days of happiness
Before I finally close my eyes
Take my soul back to that special place
And I'll show you where all my secret lies
Before I finally close my eyes
Let the clock tick slow for a while
And I'll show you where all my secret lies
A place far beyond the thousand mile
Let the clock tick slow for a while
For I am running out of time
A place far beyond the thousand mile
Waiting there is the love of mine
For I am running out of time
Take my soul back to that special place
Waiting there is the love of mine
Oh return me my days of happiness
