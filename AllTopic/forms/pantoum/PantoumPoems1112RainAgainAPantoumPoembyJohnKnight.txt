Horrible - It's raining once again today
Relentless and unstoppable the rain
Skies so heavy - leaden and so grey
Pouring down from roof and window pane.
Relentless and unstoppable the rain
Pouring  roaring down as from a dam
Pouring down from roof and window pane
Force far greater than a battering ram!
Pouring roaring down as from a dam
Pouring down to rivers from the streams
Force far greater than a battering ram
Rain is never gentle as it seems.
Pouring down to rivers from the streams
Skies so heavy - leaden and so grey
Rain is never gentle as it seems
Horrible - It's raining once again today!
