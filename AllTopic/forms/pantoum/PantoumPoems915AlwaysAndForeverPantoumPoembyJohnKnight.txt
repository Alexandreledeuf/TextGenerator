I feel the warmness of your smile

Your presence makes my heart rejoice.

Please with me - always will you stay?

You share my daily joy and pain
Your guidence makes me what I am

You are my Shepherd - I'm your Lamb.
Your guidence makes me what I am
You are my 'Bride' and I'm your 'Groom'
You are my Shepherd - I'm your Lamb
With you my love will grow and bloom.
You are my 'Bride' and I'm your 'Groom'
We'll share our lives each hour each day
With you my love will grow and bloom
Our love will never fade away.
I love your oh so witty style
