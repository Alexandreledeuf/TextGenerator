When nightime comes in pale dark hues
I wonder why it brings the blues
Like shadows falling from the sky
You feed my doubts, I sob and cry
I wonder why it brings the blues
Your love turned cold, I'm now confused
You feed my doubts, I sob and cry
It hurts to say that eyes don't lie
Your love turned cold,  I'm now confused
In velvet haze, the fiery fire defused
It hurts to say that eyes don't lie
In coldest nights, the more I die
In velvet haze, the fiery fire defused
When nightime comes in pale dark hues
In coldest nights, the more I die
Like shadows falling from the sky
