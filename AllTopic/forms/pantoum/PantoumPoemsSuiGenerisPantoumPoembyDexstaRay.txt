I did respect her passion for the arts
Neigh that riverbed reflecting soothing
Light that called her eyes another measure
With her scarf arresting minds constantly
Neigh that riverbed reflecting soothing
Vibes of something deeper than the skies up
Her painting trumps the ink within the time
I heard the colors answer back to
Vibes of something deeper than the skies up
And higher than the sea above it's floor
Where the vines brushed to symbolize the dove
As descriptive as it was flying
Higher than the sea above it's floor as
It was shining even though the purples
Met the oranges and it blended well
The brush of hope of faith. Adjusting more
Where the vines brushed to symbolize the dove
And olive branches showed the proof of hope
A magnet or a nail into attraction
Leaving lines crushed from all the abstract stuff
That was shining even though the purples
Blended with the brighter area's shaping's
Neigh that riverbed imagined from the shards
I did respect her passion for the arts
