What flower do i want to be?
I ask myself in garden of the world,
In front of it i humble contemplate,
Amazed by beautiness that lies in it.

A rose with seductive suave fragrance i feel,
Amazed by beautiness that lies in it,
So romantic feelings the velvet rose petals awakes in me.

Such a worthy tulip rising up like a pray towards the sun.
