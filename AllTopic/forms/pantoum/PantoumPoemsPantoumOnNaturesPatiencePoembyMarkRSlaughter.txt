Surviving all to seize the hour;
A firm reward: a solitary flower.
With pinch of time to propagate -
Of seed and chance, it must await.
A firm reward: a solitary flower,
But motionless, the dainty tower.
Of seed and chance, it must await
And not by dreams or wishing fate.
But motionless, the dainty tower -
Completion lies in gusty power,
And not by dreams or wishing fate.
Unmindful patience; whither date?
Completion lies in gusty power
To cast its genes by seed in shower.
Unmindful patience; whither date? -
To dance in wind, from taut and straight.
The bantam form remains sedate.
With pinch of time to propagate:
An airy blow it must devour,
Surviving all to seize the hour.
