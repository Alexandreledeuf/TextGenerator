Clearing the obstacles that line his path,
she dances between shadows in his mind.
Although she is the object of his wrath,
at times he speaks of her as being kind.
She dances between shadows in his mind,
illuminating corners that are dark.
At times he speaks of her as being kind,
while her love registers to find its mark.
Illuminating corners that are dark,
she whispers words that speak to him alone.
While her love registers to find its mark,
she lives and blooms where nothing else has grown.
She whispers words that speak to him alone.
A pearl which hangs upon a jeweled strand.
She lives and blooms where nothing else has grown,
an orchid in the barren desert sand.
A pearl which hangs upon a jeweled strand,
reflecting love that bathes his soul in light.
An orchid in the barren desert sand,
she fills his blinded eye with treasured sight.
Reflecting love that bathes his soul in light,
his slate skies are transformed to azure hue.
She fills his blinded eye with treasured sight,
her love touched with the grace of floral dew.
His slate skies are transformed to azure hue,
although she is the object of his wrath.
Her love touched with the grace of floral dew,
clearing the obstacles that line his path.
