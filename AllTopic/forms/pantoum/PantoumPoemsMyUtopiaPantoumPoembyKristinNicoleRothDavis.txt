A slumber did my spirit seal
In the dark recesses of my mind;
To a planet far more surreal
Where a Dali clock tells the time.
In the dark recesses of my mind
I’ve built an oasis within my isolation;
Where a Dali clock tells the time
Melting eagerly in each idyllic hallucination.
I’ve built an oasis within my isolation
My mind’s eye has limitless space;
Melting eagerly in each idyllic hallucination
Until I’ve forgotten my own face.
My mind’s eye has limitless space
Imagination will take me far from this cell;
Until I’ve forgotten my own face
I float far above my body’s shell.
Imagination will take me far from this cell
To a planet more surreal;
I float far above my body’s shell
A slumber did my spirit seal.
