The horseman of red
Rides today.
He is war and puts people to bed,
While some don't deserve doomsday.
Rides today,
The horseman of black.
While some don't deserve doomsday,
The food he does not give back.
The horseman of black
Is nothing to that of disease.
The food he does not give back,
While pestilence infects who he please
Is nothing to that of disease,
Death follows the other horseman.
While pestilence infects who he please,
Death finishes what the others began.
Death follows the other horseman,
On the earth now.
Death finishes what the others began.
The horseman are starting to rule and we bow.
