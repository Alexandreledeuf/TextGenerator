Not to  see the sadness in your eyes,
I’m trapped between  forgiveness and your spite
I see the way your shoulders shut me out,
a battle in a war of hidden lies
I’m trapped between  forgiveness and your spite
and you don’t seem to see me where I stand.
A battle in a war of hidden lies.
Let’s talk again to end this cruel fight
And you don’t seem to see me where I stand.
I’m trapped between forgiveness and your spite,
let’s talk again and end this cruel fight.
It would be wonderful to hear you laugh again.
I‘m trapped between  forgiveness and your spite.
I’m nowhere,  now you are not to be found
It would be wonderful to hear you laugh again,
it would be my relief  to know you’ll  turn around
I’m nowhere now, you are not to be found.
I see the way your shoulders shut me out.
It would be my relief to know you’ll turn around
not  to see the sadness in your eyes
