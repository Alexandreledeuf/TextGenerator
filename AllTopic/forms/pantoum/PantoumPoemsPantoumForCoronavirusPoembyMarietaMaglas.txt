Transparent windows in the light,
Trees losing their offspring and leaves,
Aged men and women in the sight,
Tales that coronavirus weaves,
Woodland losing its broods and leaves~
Static life as in a fast train,
Fears that the new virus weaves,
The breaths in the torrential rain,
Steady life as in a night train,
The hues' reverse into the past,
Stones in the sharp, pouring rain,
Stressed winds and waves seeming so vast,
Blue poppies and birds fixing the sky,
Aged, wrinkled couples in the sight,
Starved infants and angels to fly,
Pellucid windows in the light.
