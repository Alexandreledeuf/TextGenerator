Come with me to the 'Land of the Free'
Where never a cross word is spoken
Come with me and you will see
Joy and peace and no heart broken.
Where never a cross word is spoken
Where all is sweetness and light
Joy and peace and no heart broken
And the moon will shine brightly each night.
Where all is sweetness and light
Where love for each neighbour is shown
And the moon will shine brightly each night
Where we speak face-to-face not by phone.
Where love for each neighbour is shown
Come with me and you will see
Where we speak face-to-face not by phone
Come with me to the 'Land of the Free'.
