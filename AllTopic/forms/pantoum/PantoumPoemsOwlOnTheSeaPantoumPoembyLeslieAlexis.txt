An owl soars over open sea
The fat blind bird in open range
Soars like eagles – incredibly!
He makes a scene, for he’s estranged.
He makes a scene, for he’s estranged
This owl in the pacific air;
The fat blind bird in open range.
He conquers every passing fear.
He conquers every passing fear.
The harsh sun and her seeping light.
This owl in the pacific air;
He travels both in day and night.
He travels both in day and night,
Through the osprey and birds of prey
The harsh sun and her seeping light
The fires for an all owl buffet
The fires for an all owl buffet.
An owl soars over open sea
Through the osprey and birds of prey
Soars like eagles – incredibly!
