When youthful zest sits down to dine with age
The wizened one consumes exotic fare
As youth becomes seduced by thyme and sage
One hopes they will enjoy the meal they share
The wizened one consumes exotic fare
While listening to youth describe today
One hopes they will enjoy the meal they share
As wisdom tells the tales of yesterday
While listening to youth describe today
Perhaps the meal will teach age something new
As wisdom tells the tales of yesterday
Will youth consume the words of wisdom too
Perhaps the meal will teach age something new
As youth becomes seduced by thyme and sage
Will youth consume the words of wisdom too
When youthful zest sits down to dine with age
