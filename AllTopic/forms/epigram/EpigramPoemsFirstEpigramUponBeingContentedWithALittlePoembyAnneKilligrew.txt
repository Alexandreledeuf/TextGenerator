1   We deem them moderate, but Enough implore,
2   What barely will suffice, and ask no more:
3   Who say, (O Jove) a competency give,
4   Neither in Luxury, or Want we'd live.
5   But what is that, which these Enough do call?
6   If both theIndies unto some should fall,
7   Such Wealth would yet Enough but onely be,
8   And what they'd term not Want, or Luxury.
9       Among the Suits, O Jove, my humbler take;
10     A little give, I that Enough will make.
