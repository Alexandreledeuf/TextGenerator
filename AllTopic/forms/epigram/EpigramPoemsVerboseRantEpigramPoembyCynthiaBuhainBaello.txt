Oh, he tried to write but he knew he can't
So with prosaic words meaning nothing,
He scribbled and typed a verbose rant
And pretended to call it 'writing.'

An Epigram is a clever and witty statement expressed in just a few lines, pointing out foibles and truths of mankind. This is very common in poetry, but we also find it in prose, film, fiction writing, politics and everyday speeches. Epigrams serve the same purpose as do maxims and proverbs. However, the main purpose of using such statements is to leave a positive impression on the audience, as they demonstrate pure humor coupled with wisdom.
