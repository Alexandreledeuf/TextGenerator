O Love, though Virgil's lays ascribe
Resistless power to thee,
Yet still I thought the happy tribe
Of Dulness, ever free;
Potent I deem'd her ample shield
Her favorite sons to save,
Though to thy soft dominion yield
The virtuous, wise, and brave:
But since I see, thy votary grown,
Even Paridel obey,
I find myself compell'd to own
Thy universal sway.
