1. The breeze jiggles, the leaves jiggle
The leaves jiggle, the tree jiggles
The tree jiggles, the shadow on the wall
In silence jiggles..the wall says
"Don't tickle me of and on"
2.Sleeping under a tree wearied a wayfarer
Bitten by a battalion of ants screamed
Said in giggling tone the rustling leaves
"Hosted with acupuncture"
