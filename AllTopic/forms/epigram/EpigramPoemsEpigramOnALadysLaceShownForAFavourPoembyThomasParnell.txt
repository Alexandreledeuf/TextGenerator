As Nelly to a chamber got
To take her leave of Ned
She loosd her lace & Cast a knot
(Ah why unlacd the maid.).
Now pull the further end she cryd
The Youth obeyd commands
And still the knot ye faster tyd
The more they parted hands
This fancy by the lover seen
She gave the silken braid
And with a kiss or two between
The parting posy said
When this you see remember me
And love me more & more
This knot when you at distance drew
Came closer than before.
