"I love you" obviously great words are kept
If I really love you;
Otherwise, those utterances vainly try
To cover my hypocrisy;
What is practically seen?
I have bomb
You have no food and no home;
Pushing you in severe chaos
I stay in my hypocritical peace
Yet my words go on, love you, love you.
