My Brazil Trip
I went to Brazil and boy was I excited sleeping in youth hostels and walking the beach in Rio holding on to my Christian values and not looking at the lovely ladies in their barely there bikinis. The German guy I shared a room with at one hostel was kind of a creep lying around all day smoking dope but I did not let it get me to sin. I took a charter boat up the Amazon and I felt how small I was on that mighty wide river, symbol of God's power, but I didn't catch sight of any piranha flesh eating fish that symbolize Satan. Back in Rio Christ on the mountain reminded me of how I am of the Lord and by faith I am promised immortality.
