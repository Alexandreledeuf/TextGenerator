Eyebrows are caterpillars with their own agenda, wiggling and arching like accent marks; they ooze innuendo; they twitch like bait for a hypothethical fool. They dart between the limits of outrage and astonishment. They are preposterous highlights decentered from the message of an expression. There is a Chinese expression for an exaggerated leer...眉飞色舞 (MEIFEI-SEWU) , literally "eyebrows flying and looks fluttering."
