Admiring my serviceberry, yes for now it's my serviceberry.  Standing beside me through the shhhh of a warm breeze.  My sitting here frees me.  I'm clothed and still but you are swaying with your auburn limbs holding onto the cotton candy colored pink petals which have been dampled with drops of merlot.  Dancing that way since it began its stay beside the reflectionary pond to this angelic spring day.   The colorful face of Nature in the blossoming month of April when the rains have not begun to dampen the spirit of sprouting souls.  Skies open up and Heaven reveals the glowing sun of glorious light and promised life.  Lo, listening to the winds with gentle discerning ears the clouds move on and the rays radiant splendor and power will begin to shower down on an undeserving host, where women and men wonder what the Truth is.
Unlike up above those clouds where Truth is the constant that rises and sets everyday in the same place, in their hearts, with Grace and Faith guiding these events, and only this temporary serviceberry endures the whole night through.  It really could be me or you or who knows? Maybe Him.  And again the word of majesty spoken in the wind calls for a return to the beginning.  Babies and old men all alike, longing for a real home where love is grown from fertile grounds and wine and honey and milk flows from every heart and mouth and mind to nourish and flourish like this serviceberry.
