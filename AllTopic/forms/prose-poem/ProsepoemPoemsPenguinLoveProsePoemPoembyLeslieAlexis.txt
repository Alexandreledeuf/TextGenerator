Though the sun sets only once a year where we’re from, I miss it when it’s gone, and it seems that the night is prolonged until she rises again -lasting beyond eternity, and then beauty I cannot see. The rainbow does not show in the dark, and stars lose their allure after 100; you cannot count them all and that, is no mystery. It is so cold that hips forget their dance and legs cross to keep their warmth, lips chap, and food loses appeal.
To ensure sun never sets again, daily I’ll waddle the wilderness of fortune until I find a suitable rock that I shall lay at your feet and cross for approval. And I will look to sun for its setting and if it were to begin descent, I will follow it and it shall not rid of me. I shall stay. Home will be comfort and you will have my trust, even when you leave me in the cold.
