Call it Devi Mahatyam, Durga Saptasati or Chandi Patha is one of those classic texts of Devi-mahatyama which really exalt and enthrall us taking to a higher plane of consciousness and purging through highly pitched mantric, syllabic, rhetoricrhythmic verses with the stress and accent taking a turn, rising high and falling during the spur of the moments of poetic recitation, commemorative of and written in the glory and praise of the Mother Divine, the Motherly Consciousness and as one of the treatises of Shaktism glorifying the victory of dharma over the asuric and satanic forces which lie they within in man in as such ego, hypocrisy, pride, lust, temptation and sinaggravated and accumulated busting, which we are blind to and unaware of while drunken with pelf and pride and muscle prowess and power. The kaash grassy flowers blooming, the cchatim trees in blossom with the bunches of blossoms hanging over, the seuli plants with the seuli tiny bloom specks fallen and littered around soaked in dew and moisture welcome and greet the arrival of the Devi during the autumnal time as if it were the Mother is coming, coming, coming, Bhagabati, Devi Durga is coming, coming, coming. The nights blanketed under the starry galaxy hearing the mystical mantras welcome the arrival of the deity under the shroud of mist and dew.
