Don't bother the earth spirit. She
Loves writing delicate changing stories.
She will invite you for a coffee, if you so will
She will give you warm bread so you stay to listen
You will have to endure earthquakes, lightenings, hurricanes
And the death of those you love, the most blinding beauty
That's how she traps you, the spirit of the earth
That's why you never ever want to leave her
See that stone finger over there?
That is the only one who ever escaped.
