I arise early from sweet sleep dreaming of you all night. The winds are soft and the stars are still shining bright in the sky. I arise after dreaming of you with springs under my feet. O sweet darling! I do not know how, but I arrive below your bedroom window.
The wandering airs are slowing down. The stream is silent and the scent of pine trees is everywhere like thoughts in a dream. The nightingale has stopped complaining in her heart. O my beloved! let my heart be upon yours for me to stop complaining.
O darling! lift me up from the grass below your bedroom window. I die! I faint! I fail! Let your kisses of love rain on my lips, and on my pale eyelids. My cheeks are getting cold and white. My heart is beating loud and fast. O sweetheart! press my heart against yours once again. It is going to break there, at last.
