I’m scared to sleep tight
as nightmares come and haunt
petrified
I’m staying out of the day light
as my chest is pounding hard
terrified
For so many years I’ve lived
now I know nothing could replace
the grace we waste
Yes, life is wasted on defeats
that come and go
too quick
And I’ve prayed to the lord
to let this ends and gives us
joy
Let me live this somber night
standing guard watching you
asleep
So my soul can feel the love
and be a spell that dissolves
the tears.
