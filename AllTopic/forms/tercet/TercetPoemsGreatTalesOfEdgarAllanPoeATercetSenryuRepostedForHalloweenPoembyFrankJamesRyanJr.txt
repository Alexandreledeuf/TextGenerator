Inspiration: ''The Black Cat'' / August,1843
Published thirty-four months after his death.
Black Cat In The Wall
Let Out A Hideous Cry
Followed By Silence...
Behind Old Red Bricks
Lay The Feline...smothering
With One Eye Missing...
Wretched Cat, Said He
He Owned This Monstrosity
Its Death Was His Peace.
