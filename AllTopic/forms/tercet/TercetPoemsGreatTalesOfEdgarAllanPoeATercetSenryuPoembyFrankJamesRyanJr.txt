Inspiration: ''The Black Cat'' / August,1843
Published thirty-four months after his death.
Black Cat In The Wall,
It's Hideous Screeching fades,
Followed By Silence...
Behind Old Red Bricks
Lay The Smothering Feline,
With One Eye Missing...
Wretched Cat, Said He
He Owned This Monstrosity
Its Death Was His Peace.
