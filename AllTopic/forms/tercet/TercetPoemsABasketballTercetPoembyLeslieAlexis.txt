Yes, everyone must have a basketball.
It's the gift that must be given to all,
Because with it, everyone can have a ball.
You can bump it to touch the sky;
Something all want to do before they die.
Best of all, it is very easy to dry.
You can use just one sheet of bounty;
Water runs off it like pretty girls run from me;
By the way, that is something you ought to see!
Just pump it and you will have a best friend,
A classy one, if you are willing to spend;
You can get a warranty that does not end.
Spalding is the brand used by the NBA,
It makes for one hell of a play,
But you do not have to take what I say.
Try it for yourself and you will see,
A basketball is a friend without animosity.
Get one! If I were you, I would do so quickly.
