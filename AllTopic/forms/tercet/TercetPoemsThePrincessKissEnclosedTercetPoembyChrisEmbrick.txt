A noble Knight like all the rest
Although well bred, he'll die today
"Tell me, Wizard surely there's another way
Must love this poor Knight's honor slay
From distant lands, I've kissed the best
To watch them wither, ashes fall
Oh, cursed this spell that I'm under
With dreams of love no peaceful slumber
That I'm still a virgin, is it any wonder
To reverse the magic why do you stall?
Your father's greed paid all too well
He used your beauty all for spite
To destroy the Kingdom's rival Knights
And so with this spell, this senseless fight
All to win a kiss and ring the wedding bell
You know the rest, but one small kiss
From the knight who's heart is pure
Will break the curse and bring the cure
For love my Lady, one must endure
And for your hand all lust resist
Soon there'll be no brave Knights left
The yard lies full of youthful bones
In many beds the maidens moan
Their lovers lie beneath cold stones
For fame and wealth, they challenged death
Indeed, the royal blood is poisoned dark
Though innocent it's all the same
You've not had your fill, these bloody games
Your soul it too must share the blame
Look in the mirror that sees the heart
You're next in line for the royal ring
You must decide, I will not sway
Consider well this other way
But for this too, your heart must pay
To end the madness, kiss the King
At last, peace to the Kingdom bring
His ashes scatter in the wind
Then choose your Knight, the curse will end.
