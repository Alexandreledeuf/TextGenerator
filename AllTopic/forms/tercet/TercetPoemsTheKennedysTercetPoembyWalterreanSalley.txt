(In Memories of Kara Kennedy
2/27/1960 –9/16/2011)
The Kennedys are a family
That—in display of unity—
Has done much for their country
A family that has paid the price
And never would have thought twice
In face of their great sacrifice.
Tho’ time has passed and some are dead,
They’ll be remembered in the thread
Of history, e’er memories tread.
And for its enduring plot,
The whole clan of Camelot
Shall be remembered, more than not.
