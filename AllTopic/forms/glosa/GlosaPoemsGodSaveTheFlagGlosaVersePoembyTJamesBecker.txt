**Glosa Verse Poem using:
God save the flag / Oliver Wendell Holmes
Last line in each stanza is from God Save the Flag the rest is my work**
Justice that reddens the sky with her terrors,
Mercy that comes with her white-handed train,
Soothing all passions, redeeming all errors,
Sheathing the saber and breaking the chain.

Soldiers are deployed to some far off shore
Willingly they give their lives and much more
March into battle in cold and in rain
Knowing their lives are never the same
Again dear god is this all done in error?
Just how many good men will be the bearer
Writing home for their fallen brother
Watching them fall one after another
Fighting for what? we ask is it  error
Justice that reddens the sky with her terrors,
With might they carry their guns and their packs
Messages to God that they will come back
Remembering family the tears start to fall
Go under the wire on their bellies crawl
Far in the distance you see the flames
Of bombed out places with out any name
Who is in charge and who is to blame
No one here wants fortune or fame
With high hopes going home is the aim
Mercy that comes with her white-handed train,
Love ones are protected deep in their hearts
Then comes the night and the loneliness starts
One more dead body a passage of  time
Many a marine has crumpled and cried
As darkness takes over and the night they do share
Hoping tomorrow the day will be fairer
Back to back they’re  watching the line
Humming a song in silent minds
Making amends for fighting this terror
Soothing all passions, redeeming all errors,
At last their endeavors have ended the fight
Time to go home their excitement ignites
Tough and rugged and mighty these men
Hearts that are breaking but hold it within
Looking out the window  it starts to rain
Thinking of all the ones that have been slain
And how all the lost have been such a shame
Finding their seats as they board the train
Then at the airport they’ll board their home plane
Sheathing the saber and breaking the chain
