Cento:  a literary work made up of parts from other works
He showered the audience with obsenities
The scribe D'esparbe's wrote of his distain
I cant for the love of me
The boy who daily cast his brazon cannon
For this side of our known world esteem'd him
I lent down planted a kiss, on her cheek
Felt there way in the erriely fantastic world
When i gaze upone your hairy continence
Down to missisippy to the lake of mexico
And wether you are Indonesion-
Son if you mastabate
A kind of yesty collection, of winnowed opinions
Just spectres and manifestations of lost pysicality
The above cento is comprised of the work of the honorable, esteemed poet Mr. Allan Saywell, Poemhunter's self appointed Guardian of Good Spelling
