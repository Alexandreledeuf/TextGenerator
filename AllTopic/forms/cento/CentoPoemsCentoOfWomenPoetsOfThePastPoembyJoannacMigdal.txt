Goodnight,  Noises Everywhere 1
(A collage poem)
Someone, I tell you, will remember us.    - Sappho
It's 4 in the afternoon, time still for a poem.2
I lift my lamp beside the golden door.3
A silence opens,  4
And I shall stand here like a shadow under the great balanced day.5
My room is so small that the days sneak in, humiliated.6
I remember rooms that that have had their part in the steady slowing of the heart.7
Why there is still all this space inside me, I don't know.8
I cannot say what loves have come and gone.9
Tonight as always there is no one to share my thoughts.10
I am a woman sick for passion,11
But barely daring to breathe or achoo   12
In my congested cosmos of agony,13
Pang after pang again and again,14
Old as if ready to die.15
Mere dust, a corpse, a shadow, a nothingness.16
I hear dire threats everywhere.17
A woman who writes feels too much.18
I have gone out, a possessed witch.19
I eat men like air.20
Many things are better flavored with bacon.  21
There's just no accounting for happiness.  22
But the mind is an enchanting thing.23
And I am a smiling woman.24
Now for a while I have fed on loneliness,25
But I am completely nourished.26
I have wanted other things more than lovers.27
To get a rare jewel is easy, to get a good man is harder.28
Ah, no, I dare not lose myself in dreams.29
What a world of awkwardness.30
I will try to be non-violent one more day.31
Make a note of this:   32
The heart asks more than life can give.  33
Today is always gone tomorrow.34
Everything passes even the sigh and the signature.  35
After all, ecstasy can't be constant.  36
I dwell in Possibility.37
Yes, for that most of all.  38
This is not verse, of course, I'm sure of this.   39
It may look like...disaster.40
Thank you for hurrying through.41
I too dislike it,  42
This ill-formed offspring of my feeble brain,43
Helpless in the desire to be completed.  44
I'd like to fit the words right, but I'm disabled; that's a fact.45
I wanted to choose words that even you would have to be changed by,46
Words that are luminous in the dark.  47
But even Dante couldn't get it right.  48
There is no salvage.49
Weeping I come to my heart's destination,   50
And I'm a child again in a night that may be the last.51
I lift my heavy heart up solemnly.52
Life, believe me, is not a dream so dark as sages say;  53
It gives a lovely light,  54
Leaving my shadow still to be with you.  55
Somebody loves us all.  56
Let evening come,57
With the damn wonder of it.  58
The only sanity is a cup of tea.  59
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet…tea.  60
