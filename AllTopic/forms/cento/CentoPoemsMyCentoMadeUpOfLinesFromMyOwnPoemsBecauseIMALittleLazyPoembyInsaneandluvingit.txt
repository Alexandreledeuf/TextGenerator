I tried giving depth,
slipping on the sky
they bawl, missing me by millimetres as they
stampede
And understand
And sail the Break of Day at last
He loveth to tease me.
Upturn with his shoe.
And when he gets boring, will you dust him clean,
Smooth and cheerful besides
Arrays of hidden treasures
Are evil,
wordy and leaf-like
