The criminal act of
these church organs
spewing
from doors half hinged
all untamed
all peeled open
all revealed
the ever static change
the buzz. the heat. the same.
in far back rows
elders rattle and bob
crisply ironed,
lightly greased and
pressed in the seats
hungry,
gnawing at the bone
