I heard
The dead
When the wind
Cut apart the heat
Only an attitude remains
Of the song, and timeless
Wind in these ears
Your bones burning in the fire
A white skull
A good skeleton
Skeleton
You are dead now
And perfectly divine
In gentleman’s attire
Friend, I want to die
Locked and frozen in each eye
I think I see you
Sitting on the porch
I’m stone, I’m flesh
I am, a shadow
Within a dream
Imagine!
Tireless traveler
Deserts of vast Eternity
Of your dry silence
Without the silence changing
You may forever tarry
It’s a puzzle
Far off from me it is taken
My heart
But I am no more
And now my heart is sore
Like a chain on a bicycle
Among the rain
Hearts go bad
The riotous glass houses built on rock
The houses are haunted
Traced in the shadow
They resemble nothing else
Though I am old with wandering
I stared and stared
Dreaming in a softened brain
Karma demands
Prepare for it
When the full moon rises
Under thick autumn stars
The wind is watching over it
The ship upon the sea
Tosses me helplessly
Into the world we share
A ghost’s endeavor
There is no other life
The street is deserted
And its full of sadness
My words
Quick little splinters of life
I love you still among these cold things
The mood
The wind The wind
It is the hour of departure. Oh abandoned one!
Six o’clock
And daytime is dead
And so the night became
And in parting from you now
With the certainty of tides
Stirring away from something hot
I go from loving to not loving you
I say
(I think I made you up inside my head)
I thought that love would last forever; I was wrong
The art of losing isn’t hard to master
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Life, believe, is not a dream
I lift my lids and all is born again
We share life’s joys when sober
I shall go on living
The heart has not stopped
I must not allow myself to disappear
In a wasteland of thorns
Alone in your lonesome dynasty
I want to be looking at them when they come
The doors of life
Lights,
Which will one day find
Everything
Very quietly
Give me truths,
While I am I, and you are you,
Because I love to live
And sing and laugh, and deny nothing
So winter closed its fist
To the waters. But I’m sure
A cold glitter of souls
Shinning like a wet stone in the rain
Will open wide the gates of her high palace hall.
Into the future, let what will be, be.
Till someone really finds us out.
I smell the earth, I smell the bruised plant
Thy leaves have ripened to the fall;
And dead wings carried like a paper kite.
