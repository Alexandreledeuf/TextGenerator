Beware oh teachers and also professors
You both must have to always remember
That by saction xx of our constitution
We have made knowledge's nationalization.
We are storing it now in bank Reserve
We warn you dears that you will deserve
A penalty for govt orders' contempt
In 3 days your knowledge you 've to deposit.
In the metropolitan knowledge godown
And with it you will give an affidavit
That you will accept death as penal action
If from syllabi your teaching deviates.
