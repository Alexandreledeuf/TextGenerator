Beware of artists sons of imagery
Here we appoint a team of juries.
To judge your art in a new balance
With nationalization as it's fence.
So beware oh artists, bear in mind
Produce art pieces with specialization,
Not insulting the laws of the nation.
The ideals for art pieces you have to find
With the consent of high power commtt,
Which will contain specialized people,
Who will be defamed sons of brutality
Who can destroy you with a browbit only.
