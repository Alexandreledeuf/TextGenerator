i can't think of anything
More boring, stupifying and soul deadening
Than wasting one's time
Watching hardcore pornography
But Burlesque
Done tastefully
With good acessories
That gets down to the nitty
But not all the way
To the gritty
Can be entertaining
While still leaving something
For the imagination
Maybe I'm old-fashioned
But I still think that's important.
