When I was young
Choices were  quite easy,
Vague was Right and Wrong,
Mistakes were many.
Pain gave me lessons,
Some tough and severe.
Each fall had a reason,
Now Age made it clear.
I learned to endure,
Learned caution in friendship,
Faith was a good cure
It's what Good reaps.
But I found with Light,
I can see much better,
Weigh the Wrong and Right
Walk straight and not falter.

"He who walks with the wise grows wise,
but a companion of fools suffers harm."
Proverbs (Proverbs 13: 20)
