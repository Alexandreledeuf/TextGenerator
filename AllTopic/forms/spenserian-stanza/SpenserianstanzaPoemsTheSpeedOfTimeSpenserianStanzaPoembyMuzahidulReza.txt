I can remember so clearly the day
As a tiny boy in the primary school,
A class mate told a short story one day:
"To have a cable time is not able, "
Made us much laughed and funny but less fool
As some little playful, mindless children,
Even in college we were unable
To guess the message of that great maxim,
Now time has enabled us to be enough sane.
