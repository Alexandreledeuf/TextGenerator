I dreamed the most amazing dream today.
A plane flew in the heavens with ten bombs.
It flew right over troops who knelt to pray;
Who prayed, “The Lord of David; Lord of  Psalms
Let this plane bring not hurt, instead bring alms
So that no more our precious children die
And no more children grow without their moms.
Good God of David, let none say goodbye.
O Lord God, we don't wish to kill or cry.”
With mighty voices they all shouted, Amen!
But as the sound went up, the first bomb fell.
It Whistled, coming down above the men,
Who with unwavering type faith just yelled:
“Lord let this bring no harm o sweet, sweet Noel,
We trust and know in you it will be done.”
With this, they joined each hand as one, but then,
A bright light flashed -  as brilliant as the sun -
With such a copious force that they did run.
But looking back they were  shocked by the view,
For where they thought all would become but naught,
Miraculously greenest of grass grew.
They asked the Lord for help, he laid a plot,
In  doing this he is the God of Lot.
But just as they rejoiced the next bomb fell;
This time within fear's place, faith stood in lieu.
They were at war, but no, not one could tell,
It's as if gems were hidden in the bombshells.
They fell, and what a sight it was to see,
As giants grew in  Gardens so, so green,
It were as if all Eden’s fruits filled trees.
The once deserted land became a scene,
In which the rivers counted were umpteen.
Big smiles streaked happiness across each face,
band made this the most striking sight to see!
All arms were lifted in joyous embrace,
All people praised  the Lord for bounteous grace.
