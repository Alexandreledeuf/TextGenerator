Oh fate! One blunder by a lecher vile;
one vengeful fiend's reckless and blind gamble,
how turned a paradise of wealth and style
into a hell of pyres and foul shambles.
Once arrogant Lanka now looked servile
with spilled treasures; lost charm and tortured face.
Once muscled demon race now looked senile
with tarnished pride and heart-wrenching disgrace.
How fatal, sudden, swift and grim is fate's embrace!
