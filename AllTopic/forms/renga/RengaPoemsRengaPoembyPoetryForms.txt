1-
Some snow still remains
as haze moves low on the slopes
toward evening
2-
Flowing water, far away—
and a plum-scented village.
3-
Wind off the river
blows through a clump of willows—
and spring appears.
4-
A boat being poled along,
sounding clear at the break of day.
5-
Still there, somewhere:
the moon off behind the mist
traversing the night.
6-
Out on frost-laden fields
autumn has come to its end.
7-
With no care at all
for the insects crying out,
grasses wither away.
8-
Pay a visit, and by the fence—
a path standing in the open.
