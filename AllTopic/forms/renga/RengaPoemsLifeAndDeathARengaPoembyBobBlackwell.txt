Faces, fluffy white clouds
hang still on mountain tops.
A brown dirt road meanders.
Surprised, still being alive,
stunted grasses fight to grow.
Struggling, holding back,
sun rises slowly in the east.
An emerging scene.
Flower, slowly opening,
with a glow of morning light.
Hidden places lighten
magical spaces surface.
moments come alive.
Eggs crack, and new life appears.
Stimulating changes to come.
Life, keeps moving on;
Sun sets happen every day,
a shooting star; dies.
Moon rises on a darker world,
So much goes unexplained.
