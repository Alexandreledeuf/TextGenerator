Sunday afternoon
Why can't grass rest for one day
Like the Bible says
Evil Kentucky Bluegrass
My yard knows no religion
If I was a lawn
I would be crab grass for sure
You'd know about it
But I'm not, I'm just a man
in charge of cutting the grass
No football for me
No hammock under the tree
No chips and cold beer
I have to find my work boots
then drive through traffic again
My lawnmower knew
long before I ever did
what I had not planned
Internal combustion needs
what is not in my gas can
