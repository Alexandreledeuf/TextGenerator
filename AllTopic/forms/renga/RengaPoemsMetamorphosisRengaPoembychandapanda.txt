A heart’s sacred trust
Fragile and easily bruised
Murder of the soul
Sheltered by walls of numbness
Condemned to a living death
A life with no soul
The pained motion of living
No one understands
A beggar at mercy’s door
Heart and soul long to be healed
Child of innocence
No longer is the soul pure
Desperately seeking
Fervently searching for soul
Seeking warm sanctuary
Longing for answers
Shell of what was once living
Utter emptiness
Hiding from the sight of God
Yearning for a safe haven
Child of the shadows
Seeking ways out of darkness
Starving for the light
Darkness is more familiar
Invisible from our sight
Bruises unnoticed
Such tormented innocence
Self is shamed away
Tainted by the sins of man
God's love will never falter
Accepting God's light
Shame begins to melt away
Innocence reborn
True healing comes from within
By the grace of God
Shining in the light
Through Him all things possible
Innocence reborn
A new path lit by God's love
Loved unconditionally
Out of the shadows
Behold, the new child of God
Sacred trust restored
A new measure of balance
New path of truth, love, and light
Welcome this new day
Divine child shines with the light
Safe haven is found
Deep love from salvation’s hand
Rendered to this world in peace
