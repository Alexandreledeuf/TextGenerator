Renga With Richard - Poem by GORDON GILHULY
the blue of twilight
like a soft unspoken hope:
the singed moon waiting
lucid dreams now revealing
the mysteries of one's life
we are the Moirai:
singing souls of the journey's
eternal circle
we are the mystical three
spinning mother thread of life
no one may alter
the destinies we ordain -
not even the gods
Zeus our god and leader
Like man must submit to us
I, Clotho, sing all
things that are, spin the thread of
life that marks your days
I, Lachesis, ration life
I, Atropos, Shadow Death
hear us, mortals, sing
in terrible unison,
of your destiny
I, Lachesis, belt out past
I, Clotho intone present
now the end days draw
near: the gods amuse themselves
with death, fire and rain
the mortals' days are numbered
Planet Earth in turmoil
your children fed to
the guns of madmen - caissons
stand at the school door
ready for Armageddon
Jesus and Satan at war

Poet's Notes about The Poem
This is a co-operative renga written with Richard W. I wrote the 5-7-5 hokku and Richard wrote the 7-7 waki. I would send one hokku and he would build on that with a waki. Then my next hokku had to connect with waki etc. This was fun and we recommend that other PH users try it.
