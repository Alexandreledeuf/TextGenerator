a royal rider
high on horse-
a love hunt
a girl of charm
with a wink-
a man enticed
in search for a man
in search of a wife
married all too soon
mother bore a son
bitch bore a pup
the dog is who?
day by day
scared pup
bearing teeth
begged of husband
kill the pup-
no decision
mortar cabin snacks
growl of pursuit
fear formed vixen
a husbands love
open invitation
to a vixen
then on named
kitsune
come love sleep
in a skirt
color of dawnâ€”
vanished
with a heavy heart
a poem written
everyday sung
