Should you be moved to speak in anger dear
I ask that first you test your words alone.
If meaning's very clear, then is it fair?
Unleashed, harsh words will travel like a spear,
If anger stems from blunder of my own
You know I'll be contrite and seek repair.
Why not delay, so anger can abate?
Is it essential now that blame be found?
Attack invokes defense without much thought.
There's nothing risked delaying words that grate.
With calmer words we'll both seek common ground.
Use dulcet tones to reap the goal now sought.
My love, use whispers closely late tonight.
I love you, honey; I will make it right.
