She said she would leave the light on outside
Just in case he decided to turn back
And it was a good thing she did; he did
He parked his ride, climbed the porch, snuck inside
Helped himself to a little midnight snack
Gazed in wonder at his- their- sleeping kid
"I found your light," he whispered in her ear
"And that boy, he looks like us"- she slept on
He climbed in bed as he was: found, not lost
And drank her in like she would disappear
"When I wake up, I daydream that I'm gone
But then it's night and day's well worth the cost"
Morning finds her dressed in black; it's her rite
For she's turned off ev'rything but the light
