Today's another king tide, and we'll soon find out
If the last few days rain, will cause floods again.
The streets are clean, and all the mud removed,
The weather proves the ending of the drought,
As mother nature treats us with so much distain,
And once again her might is easily proved.
The eleventh hour has passed, we ease our breath.
As I walk towards the river I see her full.
There is no flood, yet there is still anger there
But will not cause another untimely death.
Black clouds gather again, the outlooks dull,
And once again feel familiar splashes on my hair.
As I walk back to work I revel in the rain,
Who would want to see the drought remain?
