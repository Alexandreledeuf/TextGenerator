We live in a world where war, disasters and destruction
are continually harassing us as if destiny is pursuing us,
as if everything in this world is out of control,
as if the portals of hell are standing wide open
and sometimes we become ill without any chance of being healed
and sometimes we loose loved ones to death
and it feels as if we are living on the edge of the abyss
but still the hope remains that life will become better,
that deliverance will come with the new tomorrow
as if a happier future is only waiting on us.
