and with you brought a myriad of memories,
of happy times, of sad times,
of events that we did experience together
and at times we were in bliss
and it felt like only yesterday
that we did kiss for the very fist time
and in your presence life held a special kind of promise
as if there was something great to come
in every new tomorrow.
