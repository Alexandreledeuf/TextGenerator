I have often wondered about grasping men,
I have wondered about the way that the world goes
under the people that were elected to lead the way
and about their desire for fortune and fame,
about Presidents that do not waver to tell a lie,
about leaders that sent soldiers off to war
and wondered if they do consider the consequences
or is there something evil that besets each great good man
a corruption that power does always bring?
