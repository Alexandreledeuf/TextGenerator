The bell
Tied to every body's pole,
Every ceremony's pile
To do a vital thing;
It knells
And reminds,
Times to come
And times to go;
Times to start
And times to end,
Times of birth
And times of death;
Greets the new welcome
And says the old adieu,
Some take it as friend
And some take as opponent.
