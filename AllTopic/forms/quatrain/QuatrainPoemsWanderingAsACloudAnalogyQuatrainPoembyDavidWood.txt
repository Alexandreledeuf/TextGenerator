Our lives are but clouds wandering across a sky
Restlessly drifting along with a tempestuous wind
Sometimes billowing puffed up sometimes thinned
Or grey with darkened streaks of lightning flashing by
They speed with no mercy in the jet stream high above
Or labouring they shed their heavy load upon the soil
With cymbals’ of crashing thunder they bubble and boil
Yet with ageless beauty they’re looked on with love
Like clouds our lives are full of wandering thoughts
Those times we feel happy or pain or laugh or we weep
We play and we work and make appointments we can’t keep
Of winning the lottery a cheque ending one and six noughts
And have dreams of wielding power prestige or of love
But spare a thought for those with monotonous dread
We all drift through this mortal life until we are dead
And live in memories and history that once we were part of
We are those wandering clouds in the heat of the day
We start out as nothing just a few gentle wisps that grow
Shaped by the wheel of fortune as fate takes a throw
Then when our cloud evaporates we simply fade away
