What hand cast stardust into the void abyss
Thrust into the dark emptiness of eternity
And whose breath cast them adrift with a kiss
What source of Glory started this maternity
When the radiant glow of creation broke
And tiny myriads of stardust start to glow
The point when from nothingness time awoke
Where glowing beauty of spheres did grow
Those youthful orbs then sped away
Through the inky darkness they sung
In glorious splendour of colour they play
The symphony of their choir then rung
Oh Cosmic Dawn when did you start
In the vast empty wideness of space
Before time started to play his part
Where is the Glory of your Divine face
Now you dance such glowing orbs
You continue to expand in space
Drunk with your charm our minds absorb
The infinity of your ageless grace
