Come on and grab my hand
Be the first quatrain of my poem
You just start with a simile
I shall finish with a metaphor
Come on and lay down like lines
Without any comma, dot or semi-colon
I shall blow like a gust of wind
You just need to sing with perfect rhythm
Come on and burn me out
With all the fired up emotions
I shall sweep like a downy flake
You just need to bind them in new, new epithets
