She floated gracefully like a Holly Blue
And brightened the lives of all she knew
Her wit and charm seduced all beaus
Spreading kindness wherever she goes
My heart burns like a raging fire
She is everything that I desire
My eyes have such passion for her love
Cherubs dancing from heaven above
Oh how can I win a love so fair
We would make a beautiful pair
Can I tell her of my love so true
That she could make my life so new
She is my Holly Blue sweet butterfly
For her sweet love I would surely die
My poor heart beats for her alone
But all I can do is sigh and groan
Oh romance for us will never be
She has another for all to see
I will never know her love of bliss
All I can do is blow her a kiss
