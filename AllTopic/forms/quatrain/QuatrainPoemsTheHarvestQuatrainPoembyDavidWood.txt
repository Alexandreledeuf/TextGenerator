September brings a final burst of sun
The harvest is in stacked in barn or shed
Mice feed fat faces before they go to bed
Or play in the barn to have some fun
Cattle are still in the field grazing
Calves suckling to get their fill
The twilight evening all calm and still
Stars coming out truly amazing
Sheep huddle together in the night
Keeping warm in the chilly night air
Over a Welsh landscape kind and fair
When dawn breaks in soft glorious light
Wisps of grey smoke stirs from a farmhouse
Men with flat caps emerge from their sleep
The cold of the dawn makes their eyes weep
Enter the barn where scurries a mouse
The day starts as it always had done
Cattle on the hill calves at their side
Sheep in the field roaming far and wide
And mice in the barn all having fun
Nature is a wonderful charmer
We can do without most things in life
But it would indeed be full of strife
As we canâ€™t do without a farmer
