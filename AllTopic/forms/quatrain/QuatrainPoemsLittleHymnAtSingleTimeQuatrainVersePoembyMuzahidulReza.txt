A little hymn
At my single time
I sang for You, God!
You accept!
I can perceive that
You have accepted
As I am no more in wrongs
No more in corruptions;
I am no more in greed
No more in envy
No more in guilty
No more in cruelty
You are the Great
To lead me to the right path
To recover me from sins
To recover me from ruins.
