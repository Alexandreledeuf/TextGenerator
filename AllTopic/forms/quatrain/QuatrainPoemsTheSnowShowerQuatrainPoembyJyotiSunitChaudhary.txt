The sky is scattered and fallen down,
The earth is no more brown,
Winter has bidden good bye to the fall.
Snow flakes have woven the white gown.
Very soon they have started to crawl,
On the bare trees standing tall,
With Christmas trees, when they abide
Each looks like a cotton candy ball.
With stored food, having feasted inside,
In their nests, the squirrels like to hide.
Sun is too mild to dissolve the warmth,
Earth is dressed like a wedding bride.
