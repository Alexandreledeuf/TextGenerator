In rainy season rain I bear
I work in this rain
I get drenched here
I feel no pain;
In summer rain is expected
I am in heat weather
To overcome heat
Often goes my prayer;
In spring rain I feel boring
It troubles to enjoy
The season of the king
Sweet nature's envoy;
In winter rain sometimes pains
As I hardly use
Warm clothes chains
It compels me to use.
