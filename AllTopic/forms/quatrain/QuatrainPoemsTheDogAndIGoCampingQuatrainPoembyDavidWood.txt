The dog and I went camping
On a cold wet July day
We couldnâ€™t find the camp site
Because sat-nav lost our way
We pitched the tent in the rain
And got inside to huddle
Everything damp Oh what a pain
A complete and utter muddle
I then put fresh dry clothes out
And laid them in the tent
A wet dog then shook all about
So my anger I did vent
I unpacked our stove to cook
Beans and sausage were nowt to scoff
A girl walked by I had to look
With the sausages the dog ran off
I bedded down for the night
With the dog I was still sore
Sleep eluded me nothing was right
As the dog continued to snore
This went on the whole of the week
The rain did not stop or relent
We packed out gear and did not speak
Our energy all but spent
This is what camping is all about
We drove home dreaming of a beer
Just as the darn sun came out
Holiday over for another year
