He always was a courageous young man;
From his youth he proved himself very brave.
His zeal made him not see the corrupt plan,
One concocted to send him to the grave.
At her every call he jumped into his steed,
Shifted the gears, and went the fastest pace.
To him he was saving a dame in need,
But he was running his own death race.
For when she called, she was in comfort’s chair,
But pretended to be battered and bruised.
She only wanted him caught in her snare,
and told tales of times she was abused.
This enraged him, and made him seek vengeance.
He doubted God, love, and all things good.
He picked up hate and lost all reverence.
His death began - rooted in her falsehood.
Hate was nurtured by this most naïve love.
He opted to taste the snake’s venom.
He died when he stopped looking above.
In death, he stunk like a rotting possum.
He became an impassive zombie,
Who forgot all he treasured while he grew.
This young man desperately sought for glee;
What he really needed was life brand new.
For his good, he had favor with Angels,
Who watched down on him every day.
The secret of hope they gladly did tell.
It said, “Brother, never forget to pray.
It is that which gives divine reason,
Allowing you to tell truth from a lie.
When you meet with He who made the seasons
You gain endless life, and shall never die.”
In his lows, Love saw and remembered him,
The worms and stench did not cause Love to scorn.
Love came and gave again life and a hymn.
Love came and gave him hope for the morn.
