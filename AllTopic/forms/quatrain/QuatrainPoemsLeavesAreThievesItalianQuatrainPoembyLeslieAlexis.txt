The Sun shines on all, including the leaves,
From waking to the time it goes to sleep.
But leaves rob Sun, who is a sleeping sheep,
They pretend to play, but are really thieves!
Leaves take from the rich to give to the poor;
Gaining escape by changing currency,
Masking trails - making the heist seem easy.
And each day, leaves continue to rob more.
