Come now
and hold my hand
wrap yourself around my heart
as we walk through life together
and no matter what the world throws before us
we will always be together
Come now
and touch me
as no-one has ever touched me before
because when you touch me
you don't touch my flesh
you feel my very soul
Come now
and love me
as I love you
deeply
sincerly
as we live in a world that only you and I
will ever know
God you can take my hands because I still have my heart to feel her
You take my sight because the things I see are only malicious memories or her
You take my legs because I will stand taller than any man because she once loved me
But leave my arms
I beg
So that I might hold her one more time
So that I might love her one more time
Tonight I sleep with tears
the friend that I know so well
Tonight I sleep with loves lost lies
whispering the prosperity that I so much want
that I so much can't have
Tonight I sleep in the void that her heart left me
wondering what time has left for me now that
she's gone
But time will pass and I will sleep forever.
