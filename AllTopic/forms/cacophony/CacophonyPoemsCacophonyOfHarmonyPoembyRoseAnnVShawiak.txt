Peaceful serenity falls upon my mind, giving me food for thought as I fondle ideas with precision in grammatical order.
Letting go entirely of life, traipsing into forests of freedom, being led by inner independence acquired when just a child.
Honing in on a cacophony of harmony, keeping pace with it's awesome ability to participate subconsciously and entirely in my intellectual abilities.
Accolades of strident triumphs giving me moments of inspired tones, guiding me through tangled jungles of brain cells, tumbling out into many exacting rhymes of verse.
Lifting my spirits, taking me away from earthly pursuits just to become the music I was born to make through words and compositions.
