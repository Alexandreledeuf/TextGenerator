when i walk alone Colon
i remember being treated for free barbecue
by my sister during her student days,
(it may not be important to you but it is
to me, for it was the first time that i have
had a free barbecue
with white rice wrapped by coconut leaves)
nothing significant really like it is an ordinary day
but there is one thing that i cannot tell you
i have seen stars there,
people who shine ordinarily without anybody knowing
that they are stars in their own right,
ordinariness felt
something that pleases you when you walk
and no one knows you
independent, open, nothing significant
you become real.
