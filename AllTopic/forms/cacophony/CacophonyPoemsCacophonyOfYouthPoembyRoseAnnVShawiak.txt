Awake, alert, writing, having no urges to fall asleep just
yet, mind wandering down hapless lanes of hope and promise,
wanting to find directions in which to now go.
Spider-like, falling into ravines, catching hold, grasping
all that is good for another even now, forever preserving
the cacophony of youth.
