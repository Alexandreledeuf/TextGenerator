The deafening sound
Where every joy every fear
Comes to life
There is talk and talk of
Broken promises empty dreams
Beautiful hopes and petty wishes
I do not hear them
These faint whispers are saying nothing
To me
I cast these notions aside
Still they persist to drag me in
To their arms
To their embrace
I cry out
'I am a changed man'
Only to realize
I am the same man
A tiger growls inside my soul
Hungry for the days past
Days when I slept
In dreamless bliss
Alone
