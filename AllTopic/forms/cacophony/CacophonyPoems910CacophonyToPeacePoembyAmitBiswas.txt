I had strayed into cacophony from routine,
The din sounded like music to my ears,
Wasn’t long, the blare consumed my attention,
I wasn’t listening anymore, confused,
I was pushed from cacophony to silence,
I spent time, do not know how long,
I recovered from silence to hearing,
With the help of a lot of tender caring,
Every journey leaves you learned,
Few learning are hard earned,
Every learning has a cost,
Few learning leave you lost,
When I regained myself,
I looked around to assess,
My surroundings had changed,
I live in a different world now,
It’s a lot of peace out here,
I can hear birds chirping,
I can see children in the park playing,
I have started working and thinking.
