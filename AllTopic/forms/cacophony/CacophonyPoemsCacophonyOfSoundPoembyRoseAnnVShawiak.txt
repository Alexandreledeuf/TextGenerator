Cacophony of sound, delivering sounds quickly and quietly to inner pages of books, long since written and foretold.
Seasons taking me away into summer heat and winter frost, stirring the mixtures of unbegotten silence.
Tapping life into poetry as words fly into my mind, not leaving any of them behind to belabor the chances of never being heard.
