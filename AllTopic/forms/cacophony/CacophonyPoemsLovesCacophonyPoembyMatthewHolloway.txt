For a love which seems so simple
That with quiet ease it must ring true
A rousing chorus does sound
Which deafens the calls of sanity
Should love be an illness of the mind
A sick note to the heart
Let it play and be sung in my own
That I am maddened by the sounds
The words of love which speak
Make no sense but to themselves
The song of which this word does sing
Let me be lost in their melody
Confused in their chorus
And drawn to their verse
Oh the words and sounds of love
How simple they claim to be
I find myself happily lost
In loves cacophony
