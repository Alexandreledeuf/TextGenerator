Better a broken heart
Than a shattered soul
For shards of a heart
Only quake the mind
And break the dam of tears
But a spoilt soul
Massacres optimism
Brings about somberness
Pushes one to consider
Themselves worthless
And attract suicidal thoughts
And once the spell
Is cast it's almost
Impossible to dispel
Better a be abacinated
Than have a sighting of doom
A taste of perdition
Soul cacophonies
Inner man conflictions
Collapsed soul
Reeking, leaking
Drowning
The heart, the mind
Corroding one's identity
Effacing confidence
What can the hands do?
If not to witness the body
Drown, submerged
In a corrosive body of soul
