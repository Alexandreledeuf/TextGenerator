Spare me the cacophony of your caws, Mr. Crow
I am not a bit enamored of you, don't you know?
Why are you bent on stealing my precious serenity
Cawing away from the branches of the neem tree?
To the koel's melodious notes, let me listen
And admire the dewdrops that sparkle and glisten.
Let its magical music drive away my midnight blues
Before they return with some gory morning news.
Grand is the morning, grand the fragrant flowers
Grander the luscious fruit hanging from the bowers.
Let me be drenched in the magic of twilight dews
Before my blues return with gory morning news.
Trills she, "Koohoo, get up, you laggards lazy.
Go inject some sense in a world gone crazy."
Your off-key cawing does nothing but confuse
More depressing it is than the gory morning news.
There is nothing but senseless gore, ah so chilling
None wants to listen to the koel's soothing trilling.
Spare me the raucosity of your caws, Mr. Crow
Honestly, I'm not enamored of you, don't you know?
