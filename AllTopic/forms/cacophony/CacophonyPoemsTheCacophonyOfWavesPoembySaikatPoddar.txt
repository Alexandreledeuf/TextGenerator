When you venture
Alone
Into the unknown,
The ripples
Quiet and rhythmic
Create a gentle flutter
On the surface
With each tread;
But the calm deep down
Notes the unrest;
And the contours of the shores
Reflect
Multiple cross waves
Smearing you with a refresh
With their precious touch;
And as you venture deep
To create more ripples
Absorbing and giving-in,
The cacophony
Of the dance of thoughts
And the waves
In your mind
And the surface
Know no limits.
Do you want to step out? !
