Disturbance is uncouth
You do not prize your drums
You are in soup again
With this your healing band
There were two fellowships
Already in that house
What spirit possessed you
To begin your own club?
You talk of latter rain
Now in this dry season
But dust and faded grass
Are all we see around
You say you know Jesus
But we as well know him
Witnesses gave us books
And taught us how to pray
Not with loud enchanting
Not too with drums and pipes
But quiet song and talk
We all as well did sob
We did not fall at all
No one was slain in Spirit
Who was it that told them
To kick you out of town?
