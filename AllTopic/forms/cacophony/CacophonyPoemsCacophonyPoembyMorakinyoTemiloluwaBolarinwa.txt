Hollow,
tide of the world has swept to me,
washing my thoughts, washing my mind.
This barage of opinion is vexatious,
the dumb, the daft, the dubious,
daring and dashing t'rite bay.
Truth is planted by the tip,
roots concealed in the clouds of heaven,
sweet tongues, sweet words,
vast as the oceans,
as the oceans, unswallowable,
or swallow the waters;
the desert cannot be more deserted,
save for the blinding sandstorm,
drowning, obstructing the journey north,
we journey not.
The wand of one is brutish,
same so see the word of many.
