A sudden bird cacophony
Came to me like a symphony:
They each played their part; majors and minors,
Piping their art; well skilled and first timers.
And none were afraid, of the part which they played
As some flew around, and some sat in the shade
Of the trees in the glen, where they sang to the men
Of how time makes away, with the best of our days
And how bird song outlasts both our future and past.
