THE CUCKOO'S  CACOPHONY.
A lone cuckoo utters  Cacophony anguished
Of being lonely, the crowded crows' ambushed.
Looks hither and thither for comfort
Calling some to extend safe  escort.
'Come some one, to my escape, where You
Are, who you are, how you do, mind not yaar! '
Life's  precious, priceless that yarns survival
Sings heart's sorrow expecting urgent arrival.
Other of its kind tweets in  symphony,
Exerting  friendship above disharmony,
ready, for the heart's unison, deep aspired,
Awaiting, determined, searching sanguine.
#(Based on the the touching  scene of suffering in real life.)
