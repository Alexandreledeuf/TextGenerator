My ink bleeds with a burning desire to tell the unspoken story that goes on in my head.
If only I could think of a sweet symphony to quench this raging cacophony in my pregnant mind.
I lay expectant in my pink pyjamas staring at the unperturbed Moon, for answers she refused to give.
The stars will not wink so my curiosity be tamed.
The link between the realm of uncertainty and reality is severed.
If I will but drink from the pot of Athena, I may send my anxiety to sleep.
I am at the brink of walking away from all I have toiled for.
If only the heavens can blink and give me a sign.
I fear I may sink in my cocoon till I find the answers I seek.
