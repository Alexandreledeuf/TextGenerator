Suddenly, he jumped into the river
Suddenly, he managed to jump into the river
Suddenly, at that devastating moment,
he jumped into the river
Suddenly, at that fearsome, devastating moment,
he jumped into the river
Suddenly, with a horrible wound, at that fearsome, bloody,
devastating moment,
he jumped into the river
The surging waves turned red with his blood
The cacophony of the clattering gunfire
was still vibrating in the airâ€”
and the constant cry of the wounded and dying.
Translated from the Bengali by the poet
