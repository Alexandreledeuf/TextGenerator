Screaming, screeching, restless,
The cacophony disturbing..
The sound deafening to drown the senses...
The tranquility crashing down.
The walls echoing with vibrations
The cacophony troubling my mind...
Longing..seeking for a peaceful bower,
Like cool drops of rain on a scorching summer day.
to quieten the raging torrents inside...
A wish deep from heart...
