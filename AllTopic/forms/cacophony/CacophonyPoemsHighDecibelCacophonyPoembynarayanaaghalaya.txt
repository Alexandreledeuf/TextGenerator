HIGH DECIBEL CACOPHONY
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
time for elections
blackmailers are in a queue
for fresh equations
season has begun anew
bravado is much in view
sharpening their knives
rehearsals for.Brutuses
dire, ominous.times
Shylocks demand pounds -don't fuss
Shotgun's potshots - resurface
demand for soothsayers
astrology - much in news
havans and prayers
some to get victorious
some.crush others- bit vicious
promises galore
to the gullible voters
jobs, seats, much much more
one-up-man-ship -no fetters
the trick: 'rob Paul, pay Peter'
it is a numbers game
hectic talks.with.match makers
what caste sells- just name
'secular' has huge.takers
'hindutva' also rakes-in
fundless go.in smoke
lots and lots to stay in race
principles are jokes
funds should only have black face
else ED one has to face
this democracy
with its warts has come to stay
it is much noisy
sad-no other cards to play
'Jockey or nothing' ! no way
