Pinning chests like puffins to project
fuzzy assertion,
huddled, brave foragers
chase the crumbs along the
stained ground,
flapping feathers of civility during
auspicious climbs and
daft plummets, swooping in
massive waves of perplexed flesh
until frenzied,
shifting and undulating in rage like a
storm of hungry nerves
all darting with beaks coiled
in panicked alarm: no longer just a
severe warning.
