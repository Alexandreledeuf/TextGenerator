Tyburn verse para about my physical attributes in my Sexaholic Shopaholic Workaholic series
-Gayathri B. Seetharam
Forward Poetry had a beautiful example.
Talking to my soul
Locking in my heart
Rocking in my sea of love
Speaking of desire
Seeking new pastures
Making headway in life, talking, rocking, speaking me;
Discovering the delights of nudity after marriage (Sexaholic)
Uncovering the joys of more shopping with lingerie (Shopaholic)
Flowering beautifully with love
Showering kisses on my husband
Hovering over my son
Action-driving to keep my figure (Workaholic) , discovering, uncovering, flowering me.
