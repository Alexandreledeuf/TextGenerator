Coming
Going
Doing
Nothing;
The idle are coming and going
Only wasting time doing nothing.

Rules Of Writing Tyburn:
A six line poem
consisting of 2,2,2,2,9,9 syllables;
The first four lines rhyme
And are all descriptive words;
The last two lines rhyme
And incorporate the 1st,2nd,3rd,
And 4th lines as the 5th to 8th syllables.
