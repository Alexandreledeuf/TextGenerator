They should take them to the Tyburn tree, is what my father said to me,
would be that judicial ignorant drunk who swings his hammer for the code,
and here was I thinking that the code had shed its blood. They should take them
to the Tyburn, is what my brother said to me, would you make them todays
garrotter thug who strangles the money from your wallets in the night, your
goat of sacrifice or should that be the dragon. They should take them to the Tyburn tree is what my friend said to
me, would you have them atop the Tyburn, canâ€™t you see the injustice of that
tree, you could when the blood reigned, but it reigns still. They should take
them to the Tyburn tree, is what my neighbour said to me, love thy neighbour
does not existed from what I can see, their just rulers encapsulated by theatre,
and if you are a Wakefield hang man it is no comfort to those condemned.
They should take them to the Tyburn tree, another victim of ill society.
