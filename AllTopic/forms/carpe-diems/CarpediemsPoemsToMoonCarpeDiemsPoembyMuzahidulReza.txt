To Moon Carpe-diems
February 22, 2020
O, Moon! remember
Truth will happen soon,
This message is very rare
The elements around,
The living beings,
As you see your forefathers,
Planted trees,
Made houses, furniture; where?
Your deeds will make you fit
And unfit,
Good deeds and bad deeds
Are quite opposite,
Which are always recorded
Can you see the wind?
But truth
Can you see your soul? But truth.
