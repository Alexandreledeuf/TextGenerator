Your Message - Carpe-diems Poems
February 20, 2020
Some days you will cross my grave
But tears you do not shed,
Because, you will also die
So ask other, as you are alive, not to cry;
Why cry?
As long as you are a lively tree
Live honestly
Do correctly,
Offer
Your fruits and flowers
To other,
And message of this tower;
What you do
And what you do not do
All are yours
But, think you are for others'.
