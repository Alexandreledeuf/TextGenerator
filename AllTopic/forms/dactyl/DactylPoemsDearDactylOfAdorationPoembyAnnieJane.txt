I'll say them every day you know.
Those three well-known monosyllables...
When I'm curled up to your contours in the carriage of a train,
When I wake and I sense you before I've opened my eyes,
When we're staring skywards a long way from home and mapping the stars,
When we're carefree and tossing pebble after pebble into the dusk-dressed sea,
When you're lost to your music, and don't hear my words,
When you finally sleep here and can rest in the calm...
Those three well-known, well-used, but well-loved monosyllables,
Which now mean much more than they have done before.
