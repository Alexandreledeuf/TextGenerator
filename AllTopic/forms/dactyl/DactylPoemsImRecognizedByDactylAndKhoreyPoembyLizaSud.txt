I'm recognized by Dactyl and Khorey!
although I never was Adonis' priest.
Why should I wait for praises of you, men?
when we will go to the court of Jesus!
Oh, I was loved by Dactyl and Khorey,
Anapaest, Yamb and Amphibrachiy.
What more to want from simply men?
The voice of rhythms was salutary-utmost!
