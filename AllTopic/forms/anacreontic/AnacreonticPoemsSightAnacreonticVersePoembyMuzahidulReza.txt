Sight: Anacreontic Verse
Color of the eyes
Is marvelous
And quite nice,
Some eyes look black
Some look blue
Some look yellow
And some look white,
But all see
The same sun
The same moon
Shine and reflect
On the oceans
All see blowing air
Helps to survive life
But suddenly
It raises storm;
Flowing water makes
Spring, lake, river, seas
Again suddenly
It causes fatal
Flood, tidal surge
Dangerous overflow.
