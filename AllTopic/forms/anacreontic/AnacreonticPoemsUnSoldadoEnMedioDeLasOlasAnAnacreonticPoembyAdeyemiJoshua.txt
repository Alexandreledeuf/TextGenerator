A soldier
tottered towards the
path of the sea
searching for
only what heaven
can discern.
He's meant to
be at the battle
field kissing blood
spilted out of fury.
But here is he
ravaging like
a savage in his
own stranded land.
The turtle looked
beyond to get the
view of whose feet she
heard and discern his
motive.So did she
saw the soldier
clothed with
distress, looking like
an octupus,
swathed in fear
and unseen threats.
He had retreated
from the battle,
And sook to find
comfort in
the rages of waves.
