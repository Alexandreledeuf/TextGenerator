Love for beauties
Love for knowledge
Love for nature
Love for creatures
Love for creations
For universe;
Love for humans
Love for human rights
Love for equity
Love for right
Love for justice
For democracy;
Love for republic
Love for freedom
Love for country
Love for settlement
Love for progress
For patriotism;
Love for One God
Love for believe
Love for virtue
Love for right path
Love for life and
For its true triumph;
I wrote all these
In the verse of
Anacreontic,
Hope you all will like
You all will love
For the sake of truth.
