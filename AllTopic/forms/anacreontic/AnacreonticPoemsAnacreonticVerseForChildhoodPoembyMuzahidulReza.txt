The childhood is
Early part of lives
From two to
Eighteen years old,
Fully romantic life
Much talkative
To know and imagine
Of common and
Uncommon things,
Listening to ghost
Fairy, giant, soul
Fire dragon and
Surprising, laughing
Detective story;
Catching the birds
Kitten and puppy
The grasshopper
Colored butterfly
Lizards and spiders;
Playing with toys
The daisy chain
Hide and seek
Cutting and making
Jokes, funs, riddles
Mixing with girls, boys;
Collecting stamps
Coin and old things
Planting seedlings
And watering them
Much interesting.
