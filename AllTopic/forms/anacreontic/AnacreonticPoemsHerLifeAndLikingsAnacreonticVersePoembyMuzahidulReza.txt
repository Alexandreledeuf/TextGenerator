Her Life And Likings - Anacreontic Verse
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
She was born
In March 2015
In May 17, she
Came out of home;
Unusually
If she is
On the sea beach
Likes surfing
Sometimes at home
Likes harping,
But usually
She does sing
With birds in times,
Shares the meals
And drinks milk
On dining table
But plays ball alone,
Does some duties
Killing harmful flies
Rats and insects
Cleaning spider nets,
These she enjoys much
She is my pet Tom
Much I love whom.
