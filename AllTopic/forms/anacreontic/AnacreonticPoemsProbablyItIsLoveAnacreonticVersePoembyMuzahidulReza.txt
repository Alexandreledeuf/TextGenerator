He is no more
She is no more
You are no more
Your shadows appear
In our eyes
In our mind,
Your memories haunt
The soft heart
And the brain,
Your words echo
In the ears
In brain and mind,
Your images appear
In memories
In nature
In life, in manners;
Your touches
Your memories
Touch our existence
Here, there and
In life everywhere;
We seek you
Obliviously,
What is this?
Is it love?
Probably is.
