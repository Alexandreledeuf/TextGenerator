Happy And Unhappy - Anacreontic Verse
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Happy is
No future whose
In life's stages;
Only do, eat, sleep
No much thoughts,
As the animals
That are lower
One time life
No anxiety,
No fear, care;
But I am human
I have large future
After worldly life
That is the major
Concerns give me no
Single happiness;
As I believe
Hereafter;
So I simply
Lead my life here
Try to avoid all
Vices and chaos
Like greed, hatred, wrath
Enmity, envy
Bestiality
Which can cause great sins
To damn my future.
