Meet you want
And have chat
Before the sunset;
After the sunset
I am not, coz
Dead horse arum
Lily around
Just blooms then
That spread the
Foulest smells out
As rotten flesh,
Only some flies
Fly and hum
So horribly
That frightens
Any being around
Let alone human
Sophisticated
Race in the world;
So don't come
After the sunset.
