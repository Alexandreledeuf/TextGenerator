Fill, fill your lips with honey,
You will be off on a journey;
The journey of life, filled with love,
And your soul mate is waiting,
To toast with your lips,
And fill his heart's desires,
Love, friendship, will develop soon
All the pleasures of life will boon.
Beat, beat your heart so fast,
To build enduring relations with a sweetheart;
Why leave the matter to destiny?
When you can make, own path.
