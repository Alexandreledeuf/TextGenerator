Ramadan In Anacreontic Verse
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Ramadan is
Day long starvation
In certain systems
For the month
Of whole Ramadan;
It is to Strengthen
Spirituality,
Removing sins
Being far from
All wrong doings;
Holy Ramadan is
As children
At blessed dawn
In the garden
Fully innocent;
Ramadan itself
Is quite sacred
And makes people
Such innocent
On some conditions;
If they are firm
And determined
On not to do
More wrongs, sins
In future life;
So, I call upon
All the Muslims;
Let's destroy all sins
Establishing the
Great Ramadan.
