Your gift is special to me,
It filled me with profound ecstasy;
No money on this earth can buy it,
It's costlier than the costliest jewellery.
It's a symbol of your love,
I sealed it in my  heart;
Your gift is precious to me,
With it I will never part.
Your love is bright as the sun,
Your heart soft like marmalade;
Your love shall always remain,
From my heart it will never fade.
I think of you day and night,
Your love is always a pleasure;
I shall always love you, my Prince,
Your love is a lifelong treasure!
