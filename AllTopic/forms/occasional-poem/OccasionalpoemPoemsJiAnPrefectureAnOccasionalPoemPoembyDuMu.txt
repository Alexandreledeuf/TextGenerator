Two poles set sun stream bridge on
Half thread light must willow reflection in
How much green lotus mutual support hatred
Instant turn head back west wind
Two poles of bamboo in the setting sun on the bridge over the stream,
Half a thread of light mist among the reflected willows.
How many green lotuses hatefully supporting each other,
Instantly I turn my head, my back to the western wind.
