That’s a superb picture captured in ink.
The artist confines his heart in the brush,
So much one misses each time his eyes blink;
The art as continuous as rivers rush.
His darling color- the one of life—green,
With it, he draws environments serene.
In this piece, green is the color of his sons,
And the shade of all heaven’s splendid lights.
“Shining suns, yet his intents were no puns?
But, green makes for endless and eerie nights.
He made the eyes of a forensic scene;
And makes this a case for detective Bean! ”
This is what viewers like me said. Subtly,
They became weary of the artist’s view.
His green meant life, but that they did not see,
And thought him a lunatic gone askew.
A couple saw as the artist had planned,
The rest, with puckered brows, believed him bland.
Just look upon this most wonderful hue.
See how the color darkens at the stream;
And the blades of grass are big as bamboo,
Making them the belongings of a dream?
Also the rain that falls is a lovely green
And not one person drawn is sketched lean.
His earth, he portrays as free of deserts,
It's filled with stars and a sense of peace;
Though lacking rails, the ambiance comforts;
The artist wishes for divine release.
Ah! That’s it! He yearns for unending life;
A world without all the worries or strife.
Look closer, he did not distort the sky.
All things lacking he patented with green,
But not heaven’s milieu… do you know why?
He is pleased one stays as its always been.
I love his visions; the magic they do.
In fact, I think they make a stunning view.
