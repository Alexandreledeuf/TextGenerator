At a time I did truly love,
as if it comes from God above
with something in every kiss,
something that I cannot explain,
and I longed for you again,
longed for happiness and bliss.
Memory brought me to this place
to your words, to your smiling face
the kisses from your glowing lips
and all of this comes back to me
as if I can once again be
between your loving tender hips
but life cannot be as before,
time we cannot turn back, once more
and sometimes we do love in vain
and although we know to forgive
the words, all that I then did give,
brought nothing to me but sheer pain
and time now does move somewhat on,
years and some feelings are now gone
and at a time love meant something,
to some it stays through a lifespan
and now I am another man,
who finds life and love amazing.
