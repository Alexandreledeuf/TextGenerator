ditional Zen style Haiku.Hope you enjoy.
The Hangman in Black
Amorphously Eyes The Thief
Sweating Profusely-
Through The Hood He Wears
His Knees Begin To Weaken
Toe Tapping The Wood-
Of The Plank Below
Hear The Murmur of The Crowd
Come To See The Show.
Hangman Breaks Silence
"God Hath Mercy on Your Soul"
A Hush From The Crowd,
The Plank's Chain is Pulled
To The Sound of Loud Thunder
Cracking Thick Oak Bark.
The Thief Now A Soul
Is Buried In Yonder Field
The Show is Over.
