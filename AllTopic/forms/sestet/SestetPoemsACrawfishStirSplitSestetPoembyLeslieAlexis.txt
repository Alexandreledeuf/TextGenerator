The black stripy crayfish,
makes my favorite dish:
'Crayfish-Spice! '
Which sautéed with radish,
with peppers as garnish,
is quite nice!
Mix in chives and parsley
With thyme and celery,
Salt for taste,
Some nutmeg, but sparsely,
And a little curry
To make chased!
Crawfish – a pound to pan
Simmer as in the plan
-you'll be fed-
Keep stirring till it’s tan.
Then gathering each man.
Serve with bread.
