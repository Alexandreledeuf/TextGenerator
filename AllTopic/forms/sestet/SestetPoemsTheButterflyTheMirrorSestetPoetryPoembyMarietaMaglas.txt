Delight adorns butterfly's fluttering wings in flight,
Flight is his beauty and the anemones' delight.
Wings flutter freely and the fragile spring can swing,
Swing dances he teaches the white flowers with his wing.
Breeze finds him out among the blooming red buckeye trees,
Trees push his innocent pure spirit into the breeze.
Dance nurtures the flower to put her into a  trance,
Trance is his way to gather pollen freely to dance.
Dreams fiery rise in crimson, when the sweet flower gleams,
Gleams of dawn in the sky are his love powerful dreams.
Charms are her powers to fling herself into his arms.
Arms are his wings when he searches for some different charms.
