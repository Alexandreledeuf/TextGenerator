Lies from you in the sweetest guise,
guise you were, spilling lies.
Tears on my pillow with all my fears,
fears of drowning in all my tears.
Pained with truth, my heart is stained,
stained with lies, my soul is pained.
'I love you' you say, your greatest lie,
lie about love between you and I.
True, you spoke it and I said it to you,
you said it as words, I said it as true.
With him you are not, that was a myth,
myth filled with lies, it's me you're not with.
