As I sat as the sea shore,
A man of ill state i did saw:
His eyes,
Have cries
That nature had lent him.
Battered and shartered beside the sea was he,
Laying helpless with the last breath
Striving to leave for death.
Torn attire: as that of a king-
The sea indeed pierce him with her sting.
Hair washed white in misery,
Body baked in sorry.
But, yet despite his state,
With his glottis he did say:
'Why marvel at me though lad?
Why think over me and thus sad?
I'm a man of a clan,
With plans in span.
Though i may be here in death,
But qoute me, the sea cannot fear my breath!
Only if i'll give in to her alone,
Then alone will my life in her flown".
