Counting spaces between the notes,
the music came alive
The melody deepened, the band on fire,
all bees have left the hive
Breathing in one fast refrain,
my lungs too full to stop
An Angel melts his pearl baton,
the Sirens blazing hot
New sounds created, harp destroyed,
the clouds all push apart
As heaven waits for one last riff,
â€”to claim my beating heart
(Villanova Pennsylvania: February,2018)
