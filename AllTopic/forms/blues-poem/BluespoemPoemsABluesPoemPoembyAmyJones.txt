Seems all my days of late
Are spent in doubt
Regrettin’ what I done
Wonderin’ how to get out
Y’see a while ago
I made a big mistake
Now I’m wishing it’s a dream
Please Lord, let me wake
This awful thing I done
Was while my beau was gone
I started to forget him
And had myself some fun
I met this hot distraction
Things started getting’ hot
Before I cleared my head
This man has got me caught
So I made my bed with him
He rubbed me right and how
Until my beau got home
What I gonna tell him now?
I told my beau the truth
He dumped me and fast
So I stayed with the hottie
But the love didn’t last
I was missing my beau
The worse things got
I tried to get him back
But my beau he told me off
Seems all my days of late
Are spent in doubt
Regrettin’ what I done
Wonderin’ how to get out.
