It's better to let her…
keep those fancy shoes and bags
if she comes to bed each night
It's better to let her…
have the house worn and ragged
if the trim stays fresh and light
It's better to let her…
whine and constantly bemoan
if she smells like summer rain
It's better to let her…
cash the checks you bring home
—if she'll whisper those words again
