My days and nights
death in between
trouble in front—behind
The devil hijacking my
fondest dream
trouble in front—behind
She said she loved me
then said it twice
trouble in front—behind
The day I got fired
she turned to ice
trouble in front—behind
I pass out stoned
and wake up hard
trouble in front—behind
With time my warden
and sentence scarred
trouble in front—behind
My children's names
now others call
trouble in front—behind
The doctor warns…
"Not one more fall"
trouble in front—behind
Excuses inked
across my chest
trouble in front—behind
The good got better
but the worst got best
trouble in front—behind
My eyes stay swollen
my mojo light
trouble in front—behind
The river rolling
the falls in sight
trouble in front—behind
