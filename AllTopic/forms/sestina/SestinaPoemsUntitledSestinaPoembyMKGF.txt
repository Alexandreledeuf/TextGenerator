Capture me from the fingertips of time,
As you offer me your heart for shelter,
As my heart feel you through your tender love,
As the heavens connive with fate and life,
As my heart and yours feel the breath of death,
As we face the magnificence of God.
I clasp my hands facing the warmth of God
In the midst of this dark chaotic time.
Shall I see your face before my sweet death?
Shall I feel your arms’ comforting Shelter?
My dear, how shall I tread without your Life?
My dream above, is it of an unrequited love?
My heart shatters slowly because of Love.
I wait, embracing love, praying to God.
What I humbly ask is a simple life;
Joy is an option, a love based on time;
And fate I hear offers a warm Shelter
To those who wait before they face their death.
As I wait the summon of my sweet death,
I wait patiently to be seen by Love.
To find comfort and strength in Love’s Shelter
As it was once shown by the lips of God,
When every being showed truth at that time,
And when every being believed in life.
Why? Why is it that when I live my life,
When I patiently look and wait for death,
When I patiently treasure and live each time,
When each passing being breezes through love,
They find comfort seeing the face of God,
But I, lost…as I seek for Love’s Shelter?
I often travel, seeking for Shelter,
Journeying through what we fondly call life.
Searching for this sweet Home as I ask God
If there is someone, before I face death,
Who can journey and lead me towards Love
Through this chaotic, endless crying time.
Where shall I find shelter before my death
As I journey life and search for this Love?
Will God show me Home before I face Time?
