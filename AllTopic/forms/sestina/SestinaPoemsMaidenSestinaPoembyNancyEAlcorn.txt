I lay here, lazily stare at the sky
As I idly chew on a blade of grass
In the clouds neat pictures above me find
That’s what you do when you haven’t a friend
At day’s end, close my eyes drift off to sleep
Another day spent in daydreams and play
Memories in color, on my minds screen play
As I lie beneath a dimly lit sky
My mind not closing winding far from sleep,
As I lie with my eyes closed on the grass
My dog lies beside me, he is my friend
No better company I’ll ever  find
If I fall asleep here comfort I find
Music box Dancer in my head will play
In my mind I dance with a handsome friend
Under the moon and the stars in the sky
Light as a fairy we dance through the grass
I could keep dancing, don’t care if I sleep
Now what are the dreams you have when you sleep?
A glimpse of my face do you ever find?
Do you ever with me dance in the grass?
Do illicit visions in your head play?
All of this under the watchful night sky
Or do you just think of me as your friend
That’s ok; it’s cool, just being your friend
And I would not want to cause you lack of sleep
My eyes now wandering up into the sky
Animal formations in the clouds find
I give them names and watch them as they play
Then I roll around and play in the grass
Now you may think I been smoking that grass
But I just don’t really smoke it my friend
I only in my mind like these games to play
And I like my thoughts to stop when I sleep
And wake more refreshed in morning I find
Ready to tackle a fresh and new sky
So Ill chew on grass I won’t go to sleep
If you are my friend, you will learn to find
How my mind will play, with thoughts in the sky
