I’ll try to tell you, if I kindly may
And aim to do the earthly best I can.
I’ve thought and pondered hard, so that I might
And fully understand me, if you will,
That even though these truths I never should
Mean to mention, I surely feel I must.
The first is harsh, commanding sergeant “must”
And then the harlot: sweet permissive “may”
With priest-confessor: conscience-pricking “should”.
Next headstrong artisan, that crafty “can”
Pursued by strong, assuring helpmate “will”
And, far behind, that doubting Thomas “might”.
Our sense of duty turns that dithering “might”
Into our mission: motive-driven “must”,
So if things have to be, they surely will.
Inquire not simply whether if you may
But aim to do the utmost best you can
And you will manage all the good you should.
Should we just aim to live life as we should
‘Twould help us be the heroes that we might
To help our fellow-travellers if we can.
For if we can be useful, then we must
And bear each other’s burden, come what may,
Rewarded and content through strength of will.
If you consider wisely, then you will
Find you must strive to do those things you should,
Though doubts often assail you, as they may,
And make you ponder if you have the might
And next demand if it is true you must
And, given the reply, whether you can:
Can I just do those jobs I only can?
Will I complete the course I think I will?
Must I attempt that toilsome task I must?
Should I resume the race I think I should?
Might rivals claim the prize before I might?
May I survive that setback, if I may?
Envoi:
For greed, the more I may, the more I will.
For gain, the more I can, the more I might.
For good, the more I should, the more I must.
