Just a Sestina
I fell into a burning ring of fire
with no way out it seemed save death.
Predestined early to make my peace
and arrangements made to those I Love.
Not without the feeling of remorse
did then come a bittersweet reward.
With that bittersweet and wrong reward
a passion burned despite the smoldered fire.
The faded memory of a fresh remorse
meets swiftly through the night with death.
Both knowing mortal hurt of lost love
we resolved to disarm and make peace.
You held your arms out in a sign of peace
I, quickly to accept a most glorious reward,
fell both in and out and back again in love.
With never feeling need to fuel the fire,
never having to explain my perfect death,
and never to again feel cold remorse
A cold drink on a warm day I will always love.
Leaving money as my means to make remorse.
Still clearly hot, it’s hard to stop atop the fire
when nearly warned about the threats of peace.
War is so devastating with no obvious reward
except the promise of so many young deaths.
Naivety and purity suffer an untimely death
While what’s left in its’ place cannot be love.
How can someone see an insignificant reward
The first and last reward is our swift death.
Stoke the dying fire to ignite our burning love.
Just know remorse will cost us both our peace.
