I enfold her as if I hold in my hands
A diaphanous shawl woven loosely
From silken skeins of hope and fear.  I feel
Strongly, sheâ€™s so much part of me.  Obliviously
She wriggles free.  I glance at my daughter
Her mum, and marvel at inheritance.
I wrap all this stuff of inheritance
Into trust, quietly hoping the safe hands
Of my kindly, compassionate daughter
Will suffice.  Experience tells me loosely
Held reigns are best.  The child plays obliviously.
I watch. She echoes in me. Trembling I feel
The pain inevitably she will feel.
I fear quietly; knowing her inheritance;
The curse of memory.  Now obliviously
She recalls careless conversation.  Hands
On to me stray words, understood loosely
With looks I try to forewarn my daughter
But the treacherous trait has skipped.  My daughter
Down to earth, sensible, is born not to feel
Hurts that haunt, doubts that linger loosely.
If only we could choose the inheritance
We bequeath.  But it is out of our hands,
We make love, create life obliviously.
I say nothing, pretend obliviously
Disguise fears I dare not share.  My daughter
Who loves her, is all she needs.  Holding hands
We walk through bustling, crowded streets.  I feel
Her tiny linked fingers.  The inheritance
Of knowing held gently within mine, loosely.
The web of my life was woven loosely
I held fast to no-one.  Obliviously
This child makes me unearth an inheritance
Painstakingly hid.  Bonded by my daughter
To my granddaughter tenderly I feel
Burning passions branded into our hands.
Envoi
I held her loosely, I let my daughter
Feel,  obliviously unaware of my
Inheritance, she unbinds my hands
