I can't solve the tangent of circles in heartbeats -
the pink fog of dusk and circles in bloodstone
lines perpendicular in the same core
our breaths in matrix of age, naked for rain.
We are surrendering one earth and sky
like one day and night, like cathedral and bells.
When I said  'Yes'  I meant a vow of church bells,
understood of nothing, but faith in heartbeats
no conditions, no gain, but faith in the sky.
Of God's favor, etched in diamond and bloodstone,
'Is it easy to forget the mist after rain? '
I'm absorbed in canticles of  the world's core.
I want to touch you, soothe, brimming the core,
ravish you, when night comes of  quiet bells.
When dawn flaunts with halos, lavish you in rain!
Love seeks you.  My heart rhymes your heartbeats,
on the battlefield regenerates a bloodstone -
you, forever pure, in reverence to sky.
You are beautiful.  When your cup begs the sky,
your bone ascends where water is born to core,
into silence, a solstice mark of  bloodstone,
your smile, a radiance of hope, the Lord's peace bells!
Shall I compare thy breath to angel heartbeats?
Shall I compare thy breath to kind fresh rain?
We have come.  There is no fear in love and rain,
no barriers of time, even pain, raised to sky.
There's no fence, no death, only truth in heartbeats,
nothing impenetrable, clean mist in the core.
Weariness fades and full of zeal, swing the bells!
Drought is passing,  engulfed in fiery bloodstone.
Let's renew roots and manna dew in bloodstone,
let glow of halos and shapes in healing rain
burn lies and peril in holy temple bells
bring hope to heart drunk in pain, beg the sky!
So sweet, but moments drift like beads to core
yet, always there, a  pathway to happy heartbeats.
It is labor of  bloodstone that shaped heartbeats.
The baptism of  rain sluice down a fogbow core?
Do bells mend hearts?  God spreads his wings in the sky.
