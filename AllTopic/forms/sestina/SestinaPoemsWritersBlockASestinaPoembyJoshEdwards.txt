A torrent mind divided by a thoughtless notion,
Twisted and torn into a field of commotion.
When will it be my time to write?
When am I ready to face my fears and fight?
Can it be right, to contest  my own site?
Is this block a sea of discontent or an ocean?
Is my site really divided by this ocean?
Or is it in this motion, this motion of connotion?
Is there just a real result in site?
Or is it in this notion, this notion of commotion?
I sit and I pray to my god to be able to write.
Until it becomes a battle or a fight.
It's all trite when you have to fight,
To escape this sea that becomes an ocean
Is any of this becoming concrete or right?
Can I keep going on in this state of notion?
I don't want to be lost in this commotion,
But until I win this fight I can't write.
I have just lost the ability to write,
Please don't tell me I have lost my site,
I have just lost a notion, a notion of commotion.
Can I even describe the Pacific Ocean?
Because if I can't even see a simple notion,
Of an ocean am I right to call it a fight?
Am I in the ring and it's my time to fight?
I want the ending of this block to be in site,
Oh what a wonderfully powerful notion,
To wise up and regain the ability to write
And to not drown in this sea, in this ocean.
I have to get the writing in motion
Before I lose my notion, and get going in motion.
I'm in the ring and it's my time to fight.
My pen becomes a jab at this ocean
I uppercut and plan attack in foresight.
And pen comes to paper and I write.
The motion is going and I have the notion,
I beat the ocean, and the end of the sea is in site,
I have won the fight, and I begin to write.
But is it in this motion, this motion of connotion?
