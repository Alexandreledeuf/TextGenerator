[“A Jungle Outing”]
[' Lions, tigers, snakes roam in the wild
as we prepare to go hunting
for their beautiful priceless skins,
Me and my team of greedy friends
drive in open jeep for an outing
bravely facing danger to lives.] 1-2-3-4-5-6
[Group of daredevils don't care for lives
as they are born fearless and wild
ready to go for an outing
risking everything for a hunting
to merge as a cartel of friends
all greedy to possess their skins.'] 6-1-5-2-4-3
[Of what use are these animal skins
when facing a ban in our lives
as well as for our deadly friends
their thinking so stupid and wild
instead finding job to hunting
Surprise, all rushing for an outing.] 3-6-4-1-2-5
[None thinks of a difficult outing
where roaming harms our delicate skins
to walk in the sun and go hunting
endangering our delicate lives
and skip our best thoughts in the wild
for us as well as for our friends] 5-3-2-6-1-4
[Who are these bunch of dirty friends
without rational thinking for an outing
little realizing all going wild
instead of saving full their skins
and bring stability to their lives
and refrain from stupid hunting] 4-5-1-3-6-2
[It was task to find a job in hunting
most difficult for my mad friends
by putting a stake on their lives
to go in the jungle for an outing
instead of protecting their skins
and hard to return from the wild.] 2-4-6-5-3-1
[I do find hunting and outing
in the wild with friends
exciting but for our skins and lives! ] 2,5 1,4 3,6
