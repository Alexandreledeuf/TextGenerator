The bird of my heart begins to flutter,
and the breeze of my soul is blowing free.
Velvet dahlias drink the morning dew
sweetly warmed by the first auroral hue.
Sirocco's wings brush against the shutters.
Awake! Arise! Love is a naked sea.
Yes! I said that love is a naked sea!
Doesn't it just make you all a flutter?
Come! Arise and tear open the shutters.
The singing breath of morn is breaking free.
Iris is wearing her decadent hue,
drinking sweet the cup of midsummer dew.
A pillow of roses is kissed by dew,
a silky-soft stay for the salient sea -
the sea of my love and its honey hue.
Your tongue to its tip; my heartbeats flutter.
Your hands on my body, and I am free!
The world disappears beyond the shutters.
But, O! What a world within the shutters!
Where the storms of bliss coalesce with dew
in the slit of sex sweet flowering free.
Bacchante beckons from her warm, wet sea.
Her hair glistening gold in a flutter
shimmering waves of a succulent hue.
And who could resist the unyielding hue
that kisses the walls behind the shutters,
kissing open thighs - a tongue, a flutter
until the mossy jewel drips with dew?
My love! Drown me in this prurient sea
strumming the sweet love notes to set me free!
My Lord! Open your eyes and set me free
that I might drown in their transporting hue.
Only by drowning can I cross the sea -
the sea that sweetens behind closed shutters.
Rouse my lips with pearls of moist carnal dew.
Impart passion like wind to a flutter.
So flutter me flutter and flutter free.
Drink down the dew of a flowery hue,
and open the shutters that block the sea.
