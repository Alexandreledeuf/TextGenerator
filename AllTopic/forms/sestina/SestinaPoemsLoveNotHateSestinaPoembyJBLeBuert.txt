I'm so glad that I found you my love
You must have been sent to me from above
You have taught me to never hate
Our lives entwined, it must be fate.
You and yours, I'll always cherish
Even after I shall perish
Us not being one, is a thought I perish
The nights are better with you my love
Our days together I will always cherish
My favorite times, watching the stars above
Is this our destiny, or is it just fate
The nights without you, I will always hate
Devotion is so much better than hate
These feelings I have, shall never perish
Our lives together, such a great fate
Shall this diminish, never my love
Only if the moon falls from above
Shall I stop loving the woman that I cherish
To adore, to care, to want and to cherish
These feelings are here to deny that I hate
Anything that lives on the earth or above
My heart sinks, when I see one perish
Your influence is that strong, my love
And from now on you determine our fate
I'm not sure what has decided my fate
But I must accept that fact and cherish
The knowledge that I have been given your love
To keep within my heart and never hate
The others in your life, before they perish
Because they too, were sent from above
Sometimes my heart soars in the clouds above
Never denying this grand glorious fate
Hoping that it will stay and not ever perish
Of this my Lord, I pray you will cherish
Our relationship, and not allow hate
To interrupt this wondrous time, with my love
I beseech the Lord above, to help me to always cherish
Our time, for it taught me, my fate is to adore, and never hate
Even after I do perish, you'll be my very essence, my love
