A gift of all his glory
You find it along the way
And in  every brand-new day
So much love the eyes can't see
A gift that's God's given
To continue always endlessly
For you my heart is happy, endlessly
Everyday basking in all His glory
With all the gifts that's he's given
Me and wanting to love Him all the way
Even when my eyes can not see
All the hidden beauty of the day
For so many things happen in the day
Good or bad, I love Him endlessly
As far as my heart and soul can see
My spirit sings Him all the Glory
With songs of worship all the way
And all the love that he has given
For so much to us He has given
No matter what, He loves me everyday
He helps me through all the way
His love for you and me are endlessly
I want to give Him all the Glory
That not even  often others  see
Because as far as my heart can see
Not even half of our love is given
Though He deserves all of the Glory
Yesterday today and tomorrow, everyday
My heart wants to serve Him endlessly
From now on and all my life any way
I want Him first in my life all the way
No matter what my mind and heart see
In my heart and my soul I love Him endlessly
With all the love and faith  he has given
He gives me  the strength I need everyday
Till my last breath  I'll  sing Him Glory
He has given me all and I'll worship Him all the way
His Divine love I see, all around me every single day
And I'll give Him praises endlessly and forever glory!
