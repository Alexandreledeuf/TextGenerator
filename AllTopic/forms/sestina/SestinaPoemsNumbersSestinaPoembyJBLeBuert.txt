The loneliest number is the number one
Combined with you is the duo two
Those combined you see, make the number three
Two duos that score, equal the number four
A trio and duo strive to make five
Two trios will mix to get the number six
A hockey team's sticks is comprised of six
Solitaire my son is a game played by one
A basketball team is alive, with the starting five
A tennis match with you, is between only two
A square or a door has corners that add to four
A triangle's corners you see, only equals three
There still can be glee, with a family of three
But then double it to fix on the number six
I'd rather go to the store with at least four
Dollars, instead to be stunned, with only just one
In my crew there are always at least two
More with me, but I never arrive with more than five
When in a group it's better to have five
Than to have me and only three
It's not hard to glue when you have two
People to pick up the sticks laid down by six
Don't go to a gun fight with only one
Knife, I'd rather even the score, and have four
There's fun in store when you have four
But you're more alive when you have five
Thank God our sun is the only one
In our little world, where we are three
Planets away from the center, and we'd be in a fix if we were six
Away from the sun, and we'd burn if I knew, we were only two
A couple in love can only be two
Unless you're twins and that makes four
Three couples picks will add up to six
If one doesn't thrive, then we'll only have five
When we got a dog, then we were three
Then you took the dog to your son, leaving me the only one
I only want to be a party of two, that will start at five
If you come early, at a quarter to four, then it might only be us three
If you stay late, after six, then you may become, the only one
