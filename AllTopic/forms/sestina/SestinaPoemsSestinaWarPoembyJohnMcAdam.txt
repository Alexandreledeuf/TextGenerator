There is nothing like war
But a fire
Plaguing the land
Spreading rapidly
Hurting those who cant prevent pain
Destroying those who are innocent
The destruction of fire
Guns spraying bullets rapidly
Blood seeping into the land
Not only death, but torture and pain
Killing those who are innocent
All for the cause of war
A marsh of green land
Destroyed by red fire
Turning a once plushed land to char, rapidly
And bringing pain to the innocent
To further on the war
For a point to cause national pain
News spreading rapidly
Spreading across to many in a land
About the death of which is war
Bringing to good hearts, pain
And of the upcoming apocalyptic fire
Bringing terror to the innocent
Families who can’t avoid the war
Getting wiped out rapidly
Through screams and pain
From the soldiers of hells fire
Leaving the innocent
Six feet under the land
Nations defeated rapidly
Leaving once great nationed lands
Charred by evils fire
Wiping out the innocent
Causing people and economic pain
All for a man made war
But what good comes out of war?
Though it causes pain
In the long run, you’ve freed the innocent
