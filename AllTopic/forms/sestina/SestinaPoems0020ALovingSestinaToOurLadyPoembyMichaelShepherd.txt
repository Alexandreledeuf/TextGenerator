1     In Europe, around the end of the 12th century, women
2     began to be regarded by men as more than a good lay
3     and mother to your children; but that contented sorta love
4     that even men feel afterward, could be seen as quite divine
5     and thus related however distantly to the Creator;
6     this gave rise to a type of poetry called the sestina.
6      a troubadour called Arnaut Daniel invented the sestina,
1      so it’s said, around 1190; and this new respect for women
5      as being, believe it or not, related distantly to their Creator
2      led to this, to us, rather absurd and complicated ‘lay’ -
4      that was the rather double-entendre name for the divine
3      love for mankind related to the act of physical love
3     which, though we make this a common metaphor for love
6     today, was new then, to unreconstructed men; the sestina
4     which plugs the same six end-words throughout, divine
1     and human, was supposed to underline that women,
2     exquisitely praised in the poetry of the troubadour’s lay,
5     were men’s path to loving, through them, his Creator;
5      Creator of man and woman, Adam and Eve; Creator
3      of all things and of, crucially, both human and divine love
2      and this point was hammered home; the troubadour’s lay
6      in this somewhat tiresome form of the sestina
1      was supposed to make men respectful, and women
4      feel good about themselves (like Maya)      as being divine;
4      but of course, troubadours were also human and divine
5      musicians; sexy and available (OK, blame their Creator…)
1      and, it was envied, did their own share of loving women
3      while going from castle to castle, gig to gig, love to love;
6      which gave rather a double edge to their sung sestina
2      and prompted many a coarse joke about ‘a good lay’..
2       however, poets - Dante, Petrarch - found the lay
4       a way of linking human love and the divine;
6       a profound metaphor, in a fine, poetic sestina,
5       that love in all its forms is the very nature of the Creator
3       and that we should remember this while making love
1       and perhaps have rather more respect for women..
Envoi:
5        I hope that this sestina has made its point: the Creator
3        is Love; Love is the Creator; and for most of us, this love
1       arises from, let’s say, a very poetic lay; with women.
