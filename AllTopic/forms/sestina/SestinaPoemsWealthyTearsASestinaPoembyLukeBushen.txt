I am left lost, forgotten, and alone
Me and my possessions to rust away
Beneath my feet lies a pool of my tears
Reflecting no reflection except that of my own
The sun does not visit me during the day
Yet, I sit dressed in splendor upon my throne
But, I am naked sitting on my throne
For though I am rich, my souls lives alone
My wealth, though existent, seems invisible each day
Yet selfishly I grasp for what's falling away
No comfort am I granted by the things that I own
Instead I am hollow, hence, my tears
Oh! be gone from me you cursed tears
Stop bringing rust to my beautiful throne
Satisfy me, you things that I own!
Discontentment and sorrow, would you leave me alone?
It seems as though my life is running away
And my chances to find it grow smaller each day
And the sun continues to set on my day
And my possessions still lay soaked in my tears
And I stare at their uselessness, afraid to look away
I cowardly cling to my meaningless throne
Could this be the reason I feel so alone?
Have I placed too much trust is the things that I own?
Could this be the problem? Could all that I own
Mean nothing if selfishly kept? Each day
My desires leave me feeling more alone.
My need for meaning brings on desperate tears.
Perhaps the reason is that as I sit on my throne
I grow blind, I cannot see freedom 'cause I can't look away
Maybe I should just give away
All of the riches and wealth that I own
The greedy, selfish, self-centered throne
That stands in my way, then that will be the day
When I will finally see past my tears
The freedom from solitude, from crying alone.
I've sat on my throne; I've cried my tears
But I've learned this day that the ability to give away
Stands alone the most important thing to own
