She lifts my eyes to consider more sweetly the alluring logic of her sway
Absolute in her twilight thighs, simply to strut back and forth in my view
While my thoughts crawl throughout the perception of her pleasures
Upon the pleasant poetry that her body composes within her every footstep
My own desires are resurrected, time and time again, by her radiant eyes
Revealing to me the brilliant visions that her ecstasy is capable of conceiving
Time is but divided into the seconds, minutes, and hours that each thought is conceived
Content in the nonchalant conversations that causes our gestures to linger and sway
Drawing me but closer into the goddess that is sheer genius, flickering within her eyes
The laughter in her smiles perverse my hunger about her moans upon a balcony view
Luring me to imagine fiery images of her splendid nakedness, oceanic in every footstep
Whereas the moonlight pours shivering enchantment that flows from her pleasures
Portrayals – oh, I do indeed have portrayals that are my interpretations of her pleasures:
The waterfalls that overflows from her womanly wonders that her passion conceives
All divided by backside arches, trembling moans, and her subtle spreads by a single footstep
In addition to the rippling wobbles that her buttocks produce within gyrating sway
Kneeling to witness the goddess of her thighs that completely captures my entire view
Embraced by the euphoric elegance that she embraces me with, within her euphoric eyes
The warmth in her wetness drowns the whispers of my every kiss, while I look into her eyes
Milking the majesty that marvels meretriciously throughout her murmuring pleasures
The crowning canvas of her breasts are cradled in her arms as her ecstasy is clear in her view
Alerting of the audacious avalanches that her affections are leading to utterly conceive
While her hips circle into passionate oblivion, as my hands steady her shivering sway
Reminiscing upon my other images where my thrusts would induce her airborne footsteps
My ears again, listening to her whispers – her passion, guiding me as caressing footsteps
As I indulge blindly inside of all her wildfire, due to the excitement of my closed eyes
Thus to experience an otherworldly nirvana that spirals from the sweetness of her sway
Wherefore I ravish and kiss the gush of her climax that splashes into pools of pleasure
Accurate in the achievement that her body promptly delivers and splendidly conceives
Allured by her womanly sleeve, underneath her buxom needs, that flaunts for my view
Henceforth, her vulgar delicacy triggers my appreciation for her mannerism and views
Witty in her womanly sprawling, gristle-fare, yet not obese, about her strutting footsteps
My temptations about her spectacular tabernacle-like teases, as my beliefs are conceived
Ironically, there is sincere integrity that blossoms, deeply folly, in her dark brown eyes
Strolling throughout the sensations that summon my infatuations of her private pleasures
Apparent in my idolizing her feline movements that shimmies her bottom as she sways
Thus her sensual point of view is within the presence of my ever watching eyes
Catching the symmetry of her footsteps, this is, to me, a witnessing pleasure
Still conceiving more voracious thoughts, every time I capture her sway
