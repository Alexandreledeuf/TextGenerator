There are those times in my life I don't really know anymore what I want
And confused there are all those equal times that I can't see any light
My heart tells me not to give up as I continue on my way like this every day
Like I've been doing all this time and continue to do so one way or another too
Because nothing should stop me from reaching any of my goals day and night
I know it won't be easy but there's always a way to accomplish what I see
So many things I've already gone through this life so far, so many of them only God knows you see
I don't really see anything wrong with wishing and dreaming everyday of all the things I want
Releasing my poor captured heart here and now, dreaming under the moonlight when it delivers the night
Trying so hard deep inside to understand so many things I can't see in the darkness without any light
It's so very sad for me to realize that hardly nothing is the way I believe it to be at one point too
Have to learn to live with this in my heart and soul, there's nothing I can do about this today or any day
And that's the way things always will be, and have to accept them no matter what as they come every day
Sometimes, there's nothing I can do anyway, there's so much I can do on my own without God I can't see
I just wish that everything was a little easier to deal with in my life and in your life naturally too
Knowing so well that what I dream and desire can't come true every time that I want
Thoughts that come and go crashing, flying, pieces in my mind like confused puzzles that glow in the night
Wondering most of the time what have I done so wrong? Why isn't more light showing in the heart of the night
Blindly surround it by all this darkness my soul pauses and makes sure I can see my way again during the day
As I grow weary by the daily routine, my soul slumbers to rest till another daylight
And that's the way things will always be for me now and forever I can see
Having learned a long time that sometimes it doesn't really matter what really one might want
Let's then make the best of this journey in which both traveled already as you know this too
One way or another in my mind and soul I will somewhat survive all this too
Because there's a mighty power much greater protecting me out there every single day and night
Knowing that in the end it's all up to me to make of my life what I choose it to be or I want
For one way or another no matter what time never stops and from night revolvs a new day
And not all that you think or you know it's what you really believe- or you see
And at the end of the day it comes a time when I have to face each one of my fears in the light
For little by little the shadows recede when they meet and welcome the light
My soul stretches beyond and wholly partakes of my view too
Things have a way to work for the best on way or another, don't you see?
In the daylight we can see better than what we can't see in the night
Let's try to make the very best of what we can do every single day
Burning thoughts that I can't control every single time that I want
When I see the light I know then that the darkness has gone with the night
And for me too then will be a new set of hopes with a brand-new day
'Cause as far as I can see and I know I can do with my life what I want!
