To tell you the truth,
I never quite bought,
The things you thrust upon me,
Such as your beliefs.
And the way you lived your life,
As if you knew nothing of love
And the coldness of your love,
The hallowness of your truth,
Brought hate to my life.
The lies that I bought,
The things you said belonged to your beliefs,
Were said to kill and hurt me.
The things you told me,
Things about your love,
I set to my beliefs,
And took them as the truth.
Like the presents that you bought,
You meant nothing in my life.
And yet you haunt this life,
The words you whispered float around me.
The words that you had bought,
At the low price of my love.
I wonder now if you ever told the truth,
Or if you just conquered and added this to your beliefs.
That ever-growing system of beliefs,
That you carry around your life,
Like a burden of truth,
That is lightened by no one, not even me.
The cost of this is never love,
And you fill your void with things that you have bought
All those things, those items, that you have bought,
Do they rely on your beliefs?
Or are there just there for the love
That you will miss, your whole life.
And I feel blessed, a brand new me,
Because I know your heavy truth.
I love the hate you’ve bought,
And you think there is truth in all that you believe,
Because you can barely live without me.
