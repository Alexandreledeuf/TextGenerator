Music resonates in the air tonight,
violins play "The Starlight Symphony."
Their notes gently hushed in sweet refrain,
while flutes enhance the cello's harmony.
Our eyes align, though brief, to share a dream
as our hearts beat the rhythm of the dance.
Our souls unite, eternal tempest dance,
while candles gently glow amber tonight.
We meet across a crowded room to dream
as one, composing our own symphony.
To love eternal in our harmony,
to die in our last musical refrain.
The waltz of Strauss in quies hushed refrain
plays, while we, the shadows move in dance.
Our breath is synchronized; love's harmony,
and so the kiss is warm, my love, tonight.
As sunlight drenching our own symphony,
while we, the desperate hearts, do dare to dream.
As raging fire burns our souls, we dream.
Our eyes meet, once again, love's sweet refrain.
Burning, piercing, quiet symphony.
Imploring us, besieging us, to dance.
For love has found our hearts' desire tonight,
and we, as shadows, melt in harmony.
The subtle chords; a blend in harmony,
play exotic notes, the lover's dream.
Our music springs eternal love tonight,
a quiet hushed, soft spiritual refrain.
As we, the silhouettes, dissolve in dance,
we meld ourselves into sweet symphony.
The kiss of love resounds in symphony,
and yet, forever, our song's harmony.
The beat of hearts, immortal lover's dance.
The fusion of the soul, yet, dare we dream?
To lose ourselves in one last sweet refrain.
To live or die as one, my love, tonight.
While candles slowly burn we dance our dream
We live tonight in quiet, hushed refrain.
A symphony, in harmony, my love.
