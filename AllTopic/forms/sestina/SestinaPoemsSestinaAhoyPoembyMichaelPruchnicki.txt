When I was a high school student
sentenced to two years durance vile
at Saint Ignatius
the author I read most at the time
aside from the assigned reading
was an Anglo-Polish seaman
One tends to adopt the viewpoint
of a more seasoned voice
in a profession much admired
He was born Teodor Josef Konrad
Korzeniowski, son of a nobleman,
Joseph Conrad is noted
for his deep moral consciousness
and his narrative technique -
a writer and a merchant seaman
I thought to emulate him!
