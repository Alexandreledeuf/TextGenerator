Could I find you in every enchanting dream,
flowing through my life like a meandering stream
there would be a kind of bright tranquillity
while constantly you were bringing happiness to me
and everything would be gentle, clear and never dull
while life would be without rage, forever with your love full
but life in the very way that is, is of calamity and heartache full
as if we are only a part of a ominous scheme, hidden in a dream
while some people do act like gods, to other's pain and dignity dull
where they do not care about the pain, the tears that they cause to stream
and yet you do remain apart of all of this and very dear to me
as the maker of the emotional tone of our house, the giver of tranquility.
Maybe in a world of havoc and decay, it's madness to wish for tranquility,
to in moments of sheer anger and rage to envisage hearts that are with peace full
but that is the way that I do view reality with a place in the sun for you and me
and this view is much more that just another mad kind of dream
or something that lets people to a non-existing utopia stream
that only makes sense to those that are adequately mind-boggled and dull.
Even if not every day is in summer or spring and outside it's overcast and dull,
even if the life does rage on in the cities, in the veldt nature is still full of tranquility
where animals do roam free, while others do prowl, do drink at a stream,
do play, procreate and graze in their numerous herds to their full,
do act pure and softhearted as things are in a child's or your and my dream
and still predators do kill, do hunt the weak and this is terrible to me
but in a way life is what we do make of it and you are more than special to me
and where love is the world is a totally different place and it's never boringly dull,
as it gives opportunities for realization to come to the plans of those who do dream,
even if jealousy do destroy the careers of people and do smash down tranquility,
even if the streets are with raging rioting abusive people dangerously full
the impact of a selfless kind of love do others touch and flow out like a stream
and there are heroes that stand up against the madness, do act against the stream
who are the most important people to society and to you and me
and they are not of themselves and their own gains full
their wit is at the very edge never blunt or even dull
even if they do not envisage any kind of tranquility
they still act sincerely as if life is much more than just a dream.
It's time to live our lives to its full, to never know a moment that is dull,
even if you tears do at times stream, you are a godsend to me,
a person with tranquility, in life a woman of whom I do constantly dream.
