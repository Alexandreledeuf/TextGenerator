That Heaven must be this far
When Africa needs it desperately
Whilst Africans are for blood hungry
For none other than black blood
Drawing machetes and pulling triggers
With a lot of sense that is nonsense
There is just too much nonsense
The reason Africa is this far
Injustice sires and hatred triggers
Selfishness and egocentrism infecting desperately
Promoting for no reason bad blood
Always eating ravenously, yet ever hungry
Time needed for feeding the hungry
Is utilized in debates full of nonsense
Provoking each other and drawing blood
Without realizing how far, far is far
Virulently taking on each other desperately
Planting bombs and pulling triggers
The deafening sound after pulling triggers
Frightens life out of the weak and hungry
Fighting for power persistently yet desperately
And crippling African power with idiotic nonsense
Seeking allies from overseas and far
Thirstily in a crazy rush for fellow blood
In our departed ancestorsâ€™ blood
There is a cry that shame triggers
But Africa is ever to busy and far
To heed that cry so hungry
Occupied in futility and nonsense
Whilst our ancestors plead desperately
Voices from black cemeteries try desperately
Urging Africa to stop spilling its own blood
But Africa mistakes the voices for nonsense
Charging further with warring triggers
Whilst African children still hungry
Depart to grab and kill from near to far
Black insurgents pulling triggers desperately
Their nonsense is pushing peace away too far
Blood is spilling while Africa remains hungry
