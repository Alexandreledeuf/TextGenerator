I am fully acquainted with walking in the rain
I have walked for hours and hours soaked to the skin
The dog and I have wandered down many a country lane
Seeing other dog walker’s on our route we smile or grin
Sometime around a lake we go and cut through a wood
Wet leaves drip on my head echoing and making a din
Head bent down in driving rain lucky I have a hood
Though wet grass and undergrowth make my legs wet
And rain runs down my face nevertheless it feels good
We love the rain the dog and I she’s a wonderful pet
And afterwards I dry her off and she’ll lie on her bed
Looking forward to the next walk without any regret
Rain is part of nature’s rich tapestry when all is said
We love the rain but for some folk it fills them with dread
