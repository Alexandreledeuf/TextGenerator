The roses strewn upon the beach proclaimed
an overture had gone awry and missed
the target heart at which it had been aimed.
Did lovely lady finally resist
attempts to gild a lie with sweet bouquet
and disallow deceptions to persist?
Was she moved more than simple words can say,
and dropped the roses, rushing to his hold
with passion neither she or he could stay?
The ocean's waves encroach and will enfold
the roses and claim ownership by will
alone, then crush and drag them to to cold.
I think I'll save them from the ocean chill,
and give them yet another chance to thrill.
