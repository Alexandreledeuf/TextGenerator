Among the aspens, golden hills
the life I live; I left behind
to walk among the mountain rills
beneath the coolness of the trees
not knowing next what I would find
I took rest in the Autumn breeze
the mountains high, the sky so blue
displaying Nature's grand design
I watched the ever changing sights
the beaver's splash, the eagle's dive
the spotted fawn within the blind
a time to cherish, feel alive
some beauty lasts but for a day
leaves drop before their falling time
a flower's fragrance drifts away
but days like these, in mem'ry stay
from Nature's offering I gleaned
a thousand nights of peaceful dreams.
