Spring gently breaths soft winds over still bare trees
Rustling last year’s dead leaves on still cold ground
It glides along paths floats over lakes with a soft ease
Faded russet reds and golden hues lying all around
Now crumpled and brittle they crunch underfoot
With each step along the path you hear their sound
Birds in their nests telling their young to stay put
And trees have new buds of spring start to emerge
Men on horseback with hounds their game afoot
Spring rain now falling over hills town’s roads or verge
Young plants push their way through the damp earth
Standing tall in their bright youth they start to surge
Last year’s seeds with the sun sprout giving new birth
All plant life growing as the sun sends its warm rays
Even mankind benefiting from a spiritual rebirth
Spring is where everything’s grows in the lengthening days
Where new life springs forth in a glorious colourful blaze
