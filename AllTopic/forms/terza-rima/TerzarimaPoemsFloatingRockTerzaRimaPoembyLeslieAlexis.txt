It floats as gently as a feather
It goes again from side to side
It does not want to leave the ether
A rock about thirteen miles wide
Descends the sky as if it’s but
A bubble boat in tranquil tide.
It’s making every man go nut;
The place it goes not one can go
The zig the zag, so is its strut
It’s coming, we certainly know;
Such spectacle that all can see
One that brims with a flaming glow
And spans all of eternity;
It has the skeletons of days
Those of the past and those to be
But would it give us murky haze,
Or give us light in places cold,
Or maybe redemption by blaze
As gold. Is it to love, to scold -
The human race is very bad
As told… Is it to push, to hold?
Is such the fate the dinos had
That they are not with us today?
Although our time’s been just a tad
Although compelling is the sway
What really causes the delay?
