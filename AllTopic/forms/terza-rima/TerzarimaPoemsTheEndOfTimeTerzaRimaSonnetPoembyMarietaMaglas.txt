I pray, although it's the end of the time,
The angel wakes up to flutter his wings.
Fluffing up the cloud's pillow, he's sublime.
Snowflakes are the angel's feathers, like spring.
They dance with the wind of change, in despair.
The sky glows pinky in the shades of thing.
We're like icy trees screaming at the air,
With icy leaves and crystal hearts, we dream
Crystals of weeping tears in our prayer.
Within sky vastness is our bleeding scream,
Digging early graves in the war on crime,
While our thread of love weaves wounds for life's gleam.
I pray, although it's the end of the time,
Fluffing up the cloud's pillow, he's sublime.
