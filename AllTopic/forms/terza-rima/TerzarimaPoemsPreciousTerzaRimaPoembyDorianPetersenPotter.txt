In His eyes you're always precious you should know
God made you unique in every way, you see
His love for us is in everything, it shows
From every sin He wants you and me, set free
From conception for you He's always being
With His help you can always best person be
Turn from sin, start new with Him by repenting
God's always there through all ups and downs in life
Leave past behind, accept Him by believing
Have Faith in God, He'll be there in your strife
In Heaven one day you'll be with Him all life.
