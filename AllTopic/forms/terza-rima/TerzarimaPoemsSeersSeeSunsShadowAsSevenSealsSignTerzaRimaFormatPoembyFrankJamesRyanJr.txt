{Dedicated to the Annular Solar Eclipse of May 20th,2012}
See Suns eclipse first rear its shadowed spine,
glossed, warm skies veiled by wafts of stone cold grey
scape, dark and deep as black Italian wine.
Encompassing Night, circled rim of day,
this Sun a sign, the Beast has come, bewitched
by numbra's in stage, Orb(ed)     by solar ray's.
Precise movement sews each stage on stitch
in time...as cycles are most most apt to do
for perfection, science; be no room for glitch.
Four hours, and skies pre-sent normal view,
'Total Eclipse of The Sun', long now passed;
black and Gold, yielding to skies, azure blue.
Seer's come, forward, portending their last,
spilling of ersatz.....from time's future past.
