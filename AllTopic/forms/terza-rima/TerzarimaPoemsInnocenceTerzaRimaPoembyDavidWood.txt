My only advice is teach the child nature
To see the face of God in a flower
And look with love on every creature
To love trees their canopy a tall tower
And that every season has a reason
Then teach nature’s awesome power
And admire the poppy a delicate crimson
To see the whole world through tiny seeds
That form buds early in Spring’s season
And to know the plants from the weeds
Hear a Nightingale sing in the wood
To marvel at the variety of animal breeds
Feel the rain in your face under your hood
And not to get angry in the wind and wet
Then you will know nature as you should
Teach the child nature and it will be an asset
To keep that innocence and you’ll not regret
