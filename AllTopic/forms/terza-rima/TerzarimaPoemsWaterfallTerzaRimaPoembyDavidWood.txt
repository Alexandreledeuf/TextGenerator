Gentle murmurs caught in whispering winds quietly flows
Gathering momentum in soft sunlight through willow trees
A cool meandering transparent watery bliss that grows
Over the precipice their curtain hangs moving with ease
Forming eddies whose chorus sings nature’s sweet song
A mild turbulence of frothy spray rising in a cool breeze
Spreading to either bank rings of bright water flow along
This beautiful sight spread before my deep pensive eye
This image to remain in my heart so incredibly strong
Where kingfishers live alone in the banks dive and try
To catch confused minnows caught up in the rush
Now it’s only a stream flowing along just a gentle sigh
A waterfall can be a foaming torrent or a quiet soft gush
Its rich perspective is a reward that is so pleasantly plush
