I had some land in the city's suburbs
beside a pond with ferns, fishes and ducks
amidst a beautiful jungle of shrubs!
I sold it for pittance and spent the bucks.
Really, it was no deal willy-nilly.
Happy we were at that, as dough of luck.
The site is now city's central alley
with shopping malls and sky scrapers around
its worth in crores, mocking at my folly.
"Before you sold, should have had thoughts second! "
My friend once grieved, "A fool you are my pal.
You failed to make an option wise and sound! "
"You're right my friend", I laughed, "It was my fall.
I should have saved that piece of land or some
to spend on doctors' bills, drug stores, et al! "
Surprised he asked, "You look alright! Buxom!
Never saw you gulping syrups and pills
and consulting medics in your life time! "
"I made a choice that well suited my bill! "
I drawled, "Between a sail by the wind falls
and life serene; the body in fine fettle! "
