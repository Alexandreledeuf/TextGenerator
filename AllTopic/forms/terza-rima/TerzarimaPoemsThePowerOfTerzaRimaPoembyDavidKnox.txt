I am one who has known sorrow
It's become more of an identity than a burden
Like being filled with despair with no direction to go
I don't know when
This came to be
I've forgotten
Because now this is me
And I'm overtaken by this dark, this night
Overtaken by a darkness in which I cannot see
But also by a darkness I can feel, creeping up, inspiring fright
But I see it's all connected, weaved together in a way
What use is my intelligence, my reason, my sight?
My world is now the reason I inveigh
My world is a place that is sad and fey
