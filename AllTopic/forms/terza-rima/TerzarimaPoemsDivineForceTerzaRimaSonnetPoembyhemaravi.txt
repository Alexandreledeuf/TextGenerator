Prayer is the answer to a troubled heart,
Challenges meant to be overcome and solved,
Faith in God is the best way to make a start.
Splendour of sunshine around- a ball of gold!
Winds-cool or stormy reach their destination,
Warm sun and wind, engulfing all in their fold.
Water, the elixir makes no distinction,
Energy giver-Fire, also smothers,
Trees do not produce fruits in isolation.
Associations-complex and a bother.
Get caught in the labyrinth, never be freed,
Lifeâ€™s lessons-through experience can gather.
Getting rid of contempt, prejudice and greed
Accepting Divine Will engenders a new breed.
