His house a pile of rubble, stones
A secret man not much for talk
My neighbor near who died alone
Twice I passed his field each day
A piece of land beside my own
A sloping field in wild array
Once lush and green behind the gate
Years I desired, though out of greed
The eyesore next to my estate
The land I thought not worth the weeds
Still I bid fair the day it sold
For its acres I had no need
But for my daughter's sheer delight
A place to dance with butterflies
Under Autumn skies sunny, bright
The mem'ries dear when I grow old
My field of weeds bloomed flowers gold.
