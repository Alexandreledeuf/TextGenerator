Just like Facebook, cheap chains are the days trend
They're swung like pendulums in the ghetto;
That rich on Wall-Street has them, but pretend
They don't. They wear their Prada and stiletto
High heels, with chains hung down between their breasts,
In place like old tobacco in perfecto
Cigars, which soon leave stains upon the chest;
But one weak link can cause a chain to rust:
It takes but only one to spoil the rest.
They will certainly fade like scraps of lust,
That's why instead of chains I wear a ring:
Another's weakness shall not make me dust.
It is a sickness that betrayal often brings.
So stick to chains, but to my band I'll cling.
