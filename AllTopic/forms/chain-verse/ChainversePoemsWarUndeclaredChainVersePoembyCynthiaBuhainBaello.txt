War undeclared has been there existing,
From a seething anger underneath that grows.
Persistent and nurtured Hate boiling
Reaps the bitter grapes of wrath it sows.
Reaps the bitter grapes of wrath it sows,
War undeclared was written in the heart
Of those whose blood like cold water flows
Drowning their own with what they impart.
Drowning their own with what they impart,
Revenge is the price of self-destruction.
Death to their foe has always been a part
Of their people, their land, their lost nation.
