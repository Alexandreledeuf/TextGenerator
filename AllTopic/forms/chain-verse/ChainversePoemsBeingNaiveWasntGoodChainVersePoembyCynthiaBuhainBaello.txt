On a scale of one to ten,
I'd say nine would gauge it.
Many false and cunning friends-
They charmed me with deceit.
They charmed me with deceit
And wore masks to delude.
Gained my trust, words were sweet,
Being naive wasn't good.
Being naive wasn't good,
But Time shows true colors.
"Love yourself" now understood,
I learned from my errors.
I learned from my errors,
Have boundaries set up.
Friends screened with my filters
Because....... I've had enough.
