The morning sun erased the dream
I tried to trace it in my mind.
But day's brightness, it just seems
To blur vague images I find.
To blur vague images I find
The day does that, after night's sleep.
As though to tease, it's so unkind
To take the dreams I try to keep.
To take the dreams I try to keep
And so to bring some sort of fun,
I used the day and slept so deep
And had those dreams, much as I can!
