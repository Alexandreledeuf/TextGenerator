Chain Verse For The Unchained Creatures

From beginning of 21st century
The animal planet what saw
The ever happened atrocity
Was not in ancient flock of sow,
Civilized themselves they do claim
Atrocious their aim and helms,
They don't fear to catch a human
Piece alive or throw to flames,
They catch young girl or woman
Rape till the victims be crazy
Horribly they kill all of them
Or torment till they die terribly,
Atrociously they do exfoliate
Then feed the close companions
And most fiercely they dissect
Dead body of innocent humans,
The ancient bestialities do fail
Surpass what happened before
Are done by these modern cruel
The Bamar there in Myanmar.
