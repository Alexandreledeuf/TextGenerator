Chain like verse is chain verse
This may not properly noise,
Here words are used one after another as bead
Where needle and thread are needed to fit,
Also need arrangements in sequence
And there are some rhymes.

A Quatrain is a poem consisting of four lines of verse with a specific rhyming scheme. For this contest I am going to ask you to write four stanzas with the rhyme scheme... aaba, bbcb, ccdc, dddd. This is one example of a chain rhyme.
The linking together of stanzas by carrying a rhyme over from one stanza to the next. A number of verse forms use chain rhyme as an integral part of their structures. One example is terza rima, which is written in tercets with a rhyming pattern a-b-a, b-c-b, c-d-c. Another is the virelai ancien, which rhymes a-a-b-a-a-b, b-b-c-b-b-c, c-c-d-c-c-d. Other verse forms may also use chain rhyme. For instance, quatrains can be written to the following pattern: a-a-b-a, b-b-c-b, c-c-d-c.
Also cane be written with the rhyme schemes, abab, cdcd, efef, ghgh, or any of these rhymes in sevsral stanzas.
Also can be composed in one of the following three ways:
* Chain Verse is composed:
With the last word or syllable of one line repeated
in the beginning of the next line.
* Chain Verse is composed:
In stanza styles, most often written in any number of quatrains.
But any stanza form will do, linked by repeating the last word of a stanza
as the first word of the next stanza.
The repetition of a word from one verse or stanza to the next creates a chain-like link
usual rhyme, linking rhyme or alternate rhyme;
often syllabic, alternating longer-shorter lines.
One example is alternating 8-7-8-7 syllables,
the other is alternating 6-5-6-5 syllables per line.
* Chain Verse is composed:
With the last line of the stanza repeated
as the first line of the next stanza;
For the readers I included these
In this Chance Operations.
