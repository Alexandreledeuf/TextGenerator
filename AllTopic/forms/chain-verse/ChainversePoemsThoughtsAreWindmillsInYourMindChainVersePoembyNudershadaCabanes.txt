Feel everything
Everything in life
Life comes and goes
Goes like the wind blowing
Blowing to unknown paths
Paths you never imagined walking through
Through out your life there are shadows
Shadows pf uncertainty and doubts
Doubts that lead to discovery
Discovery of your inner self
Self awareness comes when you are free
Free of fears that haunts your thoughts
Thoughts are windmills in your mind
Mind is cage when you cannot express
Expression is the way to freedom
Freedom from your own narrowness and limitations
Limitations that hinder you from living
Living your life to the fullest
