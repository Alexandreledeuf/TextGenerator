I cannot seem to write love poems anymore,
The inclination seems to have left me.
I can't recall how it felt or what it was like before,
In my heart there's just a blurred memory.
In my heart there's just a blurred memory,
Nothing there to unearth, uncover, or reveal.
There's just this sense of pure tranquility
A completeness of being me, that's all I feel.
A completeness of being me, that's all I feel,
I don't cry when I'm alone, there's no more fear.
No demands, no arguments, no more wounds to heal-
I love the silence, no more angry words to hear.
I love the silence,no more angry words to hear.
Being free is such a relief,I could not ask for more.
There's strength from family and friends I hold dear,
......But I can't seem to write love poems anymore.
