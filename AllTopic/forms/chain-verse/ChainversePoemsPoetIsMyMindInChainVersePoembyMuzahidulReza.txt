Poet Is My Mind In Chain Verse
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Poems are me
Poet is my mind
Is writing me
As any kind;
Causes me
Hold a tree,
Shows me
Its boundary;
Hurts me
With feather,
Caresses me
With hammer;
Points me
Just directly,
Asks me
To tell clearly;
Jokes at me
With air,
Warns me
To play with fire.
