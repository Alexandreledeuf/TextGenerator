Believe in God, all must but â€˜why'?
Why shouldn't we trust the Creator?
Creator, who made everything;
Everything, both unseen and seen;
Seen by our two just earthly eyes;
Eyes that perceive God-made Nature;
Nature designed by God for all;
All men must therefore trust the Lord;
Lord Almighty, who made by love;
Love infinite, shouldn't we believe?
