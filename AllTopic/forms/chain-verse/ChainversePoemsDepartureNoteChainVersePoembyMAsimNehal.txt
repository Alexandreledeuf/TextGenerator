Tomorrow I shall roam free
Free from the burden of your body
Body that captivated me for long
Long enough to keep me alive
Now I shall be free from any accountability
Accountability that kept me in check
Check that I am still alive and living
Living a life which is predestined
Destined to certain path and ways
Tomorrow when this soul will see the light
Light of the day from the darkness of this body
Body which is mortal, but bundled in ego
Ego, a burden that forced mind to enjoy
Enjoy the dust with which you are made of and
And I shall roam free till ordered to enter new body.
