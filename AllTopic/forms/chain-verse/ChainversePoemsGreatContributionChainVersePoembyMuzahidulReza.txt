Great Contribution (Chain Verse)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Reminding to go to the field
Early in the morn
With all equipments
Plays the farmers' horn,
Of preparing the land
And sowing the seeds,
Of planting the plants
And weeding out,
Then of doing harvest
Working day throughout
With little drinking and food
And a single rest,
Greatly doing to mankind
Simply they spend the days
I call them the real friends
I call them the real heroes.
