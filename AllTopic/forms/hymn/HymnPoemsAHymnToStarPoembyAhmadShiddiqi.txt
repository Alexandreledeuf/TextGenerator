(dedicated to Musica Viva Australia)
a river full of hopes
we fly peaceful flags
let your song be delicate
water can hear singing night
beauty imposes reverence in star
hear joyful tune in Summer dew
quietly as honey buds she goes far
leaves our souls with longing view
loves come so eloquently
sparkles in all earth and skies
slow  waltzes enter tenderly
spirit of light beautify our hearts
(inspired by Vincent van Gogh's Starry Night Over the Rhone)
