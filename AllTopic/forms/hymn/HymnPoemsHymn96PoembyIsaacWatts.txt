Election excludes boasting.
1 Cor. 1:26-31.
But few among the carnal wise,
But few of noble race,
Obtain the favor of thine eyes,
Almighty King of Grace.
He takes the men of meanest name
For sons and heirs of God;
And thus he pours abundant shame
On honorable blood.
He calls the fool, and makes him know
The myst'ries of his grace,
To bring aspiring wisdom low,
And all its pride abase.
Nature has all its glories lost
When brought before his throne;
No flesh shall in his presence boast,
But in the Lord alone.
