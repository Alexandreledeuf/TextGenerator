(dedicated to Ms. Midori, a brilliant violinist)
across Saint-Remy border
he's gone with carnival now
who shall wear silken gown now
in times when things are harder?
on Alpilles mountain ranges dry
when summer comes again
it can removes all hearts' pain
our tomorrow will be so shiny
passionate trees grow green
O dear, since you received rain
in the pathways of the circle sun
the gate is for daughter and son
(inspired by Van Gogh's Soleil jaune resplendissant)
