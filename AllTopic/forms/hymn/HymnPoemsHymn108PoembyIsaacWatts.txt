Christ unseen and beloved.
1 Pet. 1:5.
Now with our mortal eyes
Have we beheld the Lord;
Yet we rejoice to hear his name,
And love him in his word.
On earth we want the sight
Of our Redeemer's face;
Yet, Lord, our inmost thoughts delight
To dwell upon thy grace.
And when we taste thy love,
Our joys divinely grow
Unspeakable, like those above,
And heav'n begins below.
