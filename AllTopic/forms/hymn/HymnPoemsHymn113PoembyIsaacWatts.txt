Abraham's blessing on the Gentiles.
Gen. 17:7; Rom. 15:8; Mk 10:14.
How large the promise, how divine,
To Abram and his seed!
"I'll be a God to thee and thine,
Supplying all their need."
The words of his extensive love
From age to age endure;
The Angel of the cov'nant proves,
And seals the blessing sure.
Jesus the ancient faith confirms,
To our great fathers giv'n;
He takes young children to his arms,
And calls them heirs of heav'n.
Our God, how faithful are his ways!
His love endures the same;
Nor from the promise of his grace
Blots out the children's name.
