Huge granite monument, wayside
Tells the story, high and loud
Passersby to read â€˜n mesmerize
Until sun and moon decide...enough!
Upholding the might of her breast feed
Eleven offsprings rising to blues
Treading over her yielding body
clamored loud for more and more
Emancipated physique in destitute
having breathed her last in current birth
yielded to elements for rituals, and
public let the world know, who she was.
