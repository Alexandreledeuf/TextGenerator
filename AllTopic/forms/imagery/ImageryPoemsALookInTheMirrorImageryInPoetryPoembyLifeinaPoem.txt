You stand there so silently, In the perfect frame of mind
Keeping all my secrets, A friend I always leave behind
You never judge me, And you never let me down
I can count on you, No matter what comes around
When you get a glimpse at me, Tell me, what you see
Do you believe in me, Are you proud of what you see
Mirror, mirror look at me, Tell me with all honesty
Can you reflect on me, Some of your clarity
I’m back so soon, it’s not even noon, And look at me, all foggy
Help me clear the steam, Mirror, I just wanna scream
I can’t see my reflection, I might need your protection
A dark shadow has appeared, And it feels kind of weird
Can you give me some shine, Can I have some of that shimmer
Can you make me sparkle, Like the glitter in your mirror
Help me get it together, Or I’ll shatter into bits
Help me stay whole and silver, Like the backbone in your mirror
Show me the strength that’s left in me, Enough with the crying and self-pity
Help me snip my shadow free, And turn it in to beauty
Mirror mirror can I ask, To leave the mirror of the past
Mirror mirror inside of me, What, reflection, do you see
