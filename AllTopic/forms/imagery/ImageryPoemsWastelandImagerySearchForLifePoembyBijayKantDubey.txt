Mother a skeleton
With Malnutrition as poor child
Sucking the breast of Poverty.
Acid rain,
Atomic summer,
Climate change, no respite from.
A heap of bones and skeletons,
Man dying poor deaths,
Lean and thin and pathetic.
The earth bereft of greenery,
Birds falling to death,
Poor mother, poor daughter clinging onto.
Water, water,
Water is not,
Rain, rain, rains it not.
Nuclear radiation taking a toll upon,
Man dying unnatural deaths,
It raining acid.
The waste land,
The world a waste land
With the heaps.
Barren, barren,
A barren land
Has it become, turned it into.
There is nothing to shade from
The intense heat falling upon,
No respite from.
Where to go,
What to do
In the moments of existential crisis?
