Slippery, sliding down canyon walls, viewing every
minute detail on the way down.
Being excited and happy as life takes off before me,
wondering and having a love of imagery in sight.
Touching and releasing significant particles of
intellect into coded mysteries within rhythm.
Exercising and finding answers that are created from
innate knowledge.
Knowing that I can equate the equations of various
impossibilities with an accuracy beyond intellect.
Dreaming of incessant fibers that are needed to be
attached to molecules that are dancing to rhythms.
