We walked alongside one another
and did not talk
Went past a pond filled with lotus
and saw the swimming ducks
We did not stop to discuss anything
and reached our pine tree
collected fallen pines
and put them straight in a row
sat for a while looking at the sky
heavy clouds gathered
and it started raining
instead of looking for shed
we allowed water to fall our body
and wipe our past
the scars which I felt in my heart
started to heal by the song of the rain.
