Vulture's Adventure (Imagery)
10 November, 2018
Pervading thin and thick air
The two eyes go too far
Spreading dead smell carcass lies where
With some companions two big wings rush there,
Sensitive noses help the eyes
Under the seven skies,
To jump on the carcass soon they reach
With long, sharp, crook beaks and nails.
