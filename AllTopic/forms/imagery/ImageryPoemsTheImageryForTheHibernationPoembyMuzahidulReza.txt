The Imagery For The Hibernation

Hibernating beings, you are sleeping
Thinking all seasons are for wintry beings
Filling stomach with anything anywhere you got
Without thinking whose those? Wrong or right?
You collected illegally committing chaos
Then you have entered your hole dismissing noise,
Now all other are suffering from violence you did
They look for you to fix what you committed.
