Let this imagery speak!
To the peak,
To leak the news,
Without a break.
Yesterday! !
Memories;
Like stairs in the forest,
But, let this imagery speak.
Train,
Certain! !
Rain,
With the chain of life;
But, let this imagery speak to the sounds of nature.
Unspoiled beauty,
Your colours run deep! ! !
Like a quiet afternoon;
In a trance,
Seeing flamingoes dancing in paradise
