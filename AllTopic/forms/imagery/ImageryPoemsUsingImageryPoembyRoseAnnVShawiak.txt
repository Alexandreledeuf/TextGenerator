Feelings have all turned blue, calm, yet saddened with a
sorrow that will not be quiet.
Finding a place to hide, using imagery to deal with it,
picturing a lake, ducks and swans swimming.
A pier stretching out into the water where I am fishing,
line in the water, looking out over the scenery and
letting life flow over and through intellect.
There maybe some logical reasoning that will occur to
make me feel more like myself again.
