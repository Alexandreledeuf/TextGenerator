there was once
this lady friend of mine
who eventually turned
into a man,
she wrote in objects
stone-man, orange-head,
clay heart, balcony dreams,
fork tongued, lady fingers,
ginger toes,
spindle hair, snake eyelashes,
lemon moon,
despite our distance
i too wrote her that with all
these images
i think i understand her
perfectly well.
meteor brain, grave shift,
paper principles, love words.
