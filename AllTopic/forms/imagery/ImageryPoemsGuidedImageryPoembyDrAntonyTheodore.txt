When someone
is feeling anxious
about a situation
or task ahead
of them, guided
imagery can help.
This practice involves
imagining completing
the task that is
causing anxiety
calmly and successfully.
For instance,
imagining finishing
an important meeting
or event before it
happens can
reduce anxiety about it.
Some people also
find it beneficial
to visualize an
environment in
which they feel
safe and relaxed.
