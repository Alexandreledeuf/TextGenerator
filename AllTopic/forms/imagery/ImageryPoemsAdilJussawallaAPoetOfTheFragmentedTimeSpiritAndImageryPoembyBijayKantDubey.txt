Adil Jussawalla as a poet is one of poetic fragmentation,
Fragmented time, man and his spirit,
Everything but fragmented,
Patched up and darned,
Loosely tagged and conversational,
Full of the broken rhythms
Of speech and expression,
Disjointed and distorted,
Telling of the life spent
In England,
In India, especially Bombay,
But lineage and hierarchy taking him
Back to Lahore and to the heyday
Of the Zoroastrian,
Gujarati and Marathi
The tongues adopted and owned.
