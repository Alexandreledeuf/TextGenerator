Nature was
and is still
the teacher
of poets who
strive words to get
landscape imagery,
moments glimpsed
in realism and sentiment
accurate the simple
elegance of snowflakes
is such a moment defined
a master of fallen restraint.
The woodlands
near my home
were as diverse
as native beech
with gray bark
deciduous leaves
or evergreens like
kauri and fern,
moss covered rocks,
perhaps it is time
to admit, nature and nature
poems are not for everyone.
