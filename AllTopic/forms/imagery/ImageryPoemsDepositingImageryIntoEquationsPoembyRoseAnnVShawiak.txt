A collision of voices getting tangled with rhythms as they're
being played across a stage and into the audience.
Bringing feelings along with clouds of imagery, drifting by
with open doors swinging both ways.
Wanting imagination to enter and leave while depositing imagery
into equations of tomorrows assignations.
