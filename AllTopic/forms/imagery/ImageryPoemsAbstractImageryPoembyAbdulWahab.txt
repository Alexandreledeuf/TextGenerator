I am desperately searching an image
Of what I feel
To make you understand
Inside of me which runs wild
I close my eyes
Switch on the power of imagination
But no image I get
The wish I hold for you
Neither have I got any object
To compare my delight
When I see
Your hanging portrait
Things go abstract
No vehicle, no tenor I get
To say something
On beauty you posses.
