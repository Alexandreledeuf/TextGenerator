Love needs Rose flowers
With petals open and red in color
That fascinates young people
So I write more about it  and choose the purple
Yes readers go after
Light poems and sometimes differ
But I take their each word
With smiles as grace from lord
How do I know about their feelings?
They want instant feeding
"I love you and you love me "
Totally like innocent birds flying free
Yes, yes, we need to feel that stage
The writer should not feel an age
He must behave like child
Rush to mother for acting blind
Make them wild with imagery style
That can only work in present time
They want world to know
And advise them nicely to go
