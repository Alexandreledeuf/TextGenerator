Imagery cause
Love sees no reason
Find no fault with person
The only one condition prevails
That one sided wish always fails
It has to be two side affairs
Love with earnest and fair
No cheating and no deception
Only love with good relation
Love has no color
Ibex should ask with honor
Even if you are poor
Love shall mushroom next door
The girl finds her home
And always welcomes
A person who is real worth
And stays up to death
We should not assign
And resign
With imagery cause
It must immediately pause
