Amalgam and surreal silver fusions
Flow between two ancient peaks, blinding visions
Setting sun’s angled brilliance showcasing
Norris Lake’s halo-ed magnificence
Distant layers of tonal blue – violet
Soaring smoke-y hills and mountains delight
The sky a waning clear winter-ed blue
Contrails weave their icy patterned plaids
Wispy white apparitions of other’s down
Seeing visions from east, west, north and south
Fluffy frump – l’d original gifts
Heaven-d kilts warm imaginations
Pristine golden pastures flank the roadside
Encircled in deciduous umber-
‘d lace, evergreen hemlocks and cedars grace
Dotted cantilevered black - painted
Dairy barns dressed in Pennsylvania
Dutch quilted icons and topped mossy
Green, cows graze in bucolic peace
Fieldstone chimneys sweetly send rising thanks
