Playing with melodies and their rhythms in this poetical mind,
feeling joyful and free in the midst of nature while sitting
outside in a landscape filled with imagery.
Writing it all down, translating it from memories and experiences,
a little bit of happiness and joy settled within as everything is
compiled into poetry and prose.
A sincere and truthful way to express the experience of this
temporary life on earth, giving rise to thoughts coming from
every direction.
