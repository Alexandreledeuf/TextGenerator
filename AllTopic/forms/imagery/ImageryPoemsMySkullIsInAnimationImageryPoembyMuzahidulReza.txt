My Skull Is In Animation - Imagery

My skull animates
I see it talking, chewing, chuckling,
Moving right and left
Sometimes with horrible gape
It wants eating everything;
I see and I am wonder of it
People around me also see it
But they take it normally,
They are not bothered
A little bit even indirectly,
They are in eternal oblivion;
How will I be normal?
When I see it bites my own hands,
Cuts into pieces,
Makes me bleeding,
Sometimes I am swooned;
Still I am alive! And
My skull is in animation.
