Riding the waves of sorrow
Gliding through imagery
In pursuit of salvation
Flies a poet's imagination.
Bearing brunt of the legacy
Almighty's gift of inheritance
Absorbed is the hermit in a trance
In poverty too feeling quite cozy.
Omnipresence through inheritance
Omnipotent command over words,
The lord in celestial kingdom
Trades dreams to humanism.
Long live the dream merchant,
His fountains of joy to us enchant.
