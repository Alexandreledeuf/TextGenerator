Imagery world
It is new world
That has been told
He thinks of his surroundings
With his own findings
No one is known
Nobody fits to his own
Yet it is his dreamland
No dear one and no friends like
He looks outside
With sight of singing birds
Lovely and sweet as they fly
His mind also tries freely
When they are free?
And taking rest on tree
With no worry of building refuge
How can I say no to the fact and refuse to accept
