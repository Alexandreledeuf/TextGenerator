Pure imagery
Yes, the joy is immense
That can be seen on face
Whenever I write on some issues
Surely it reflects
Not only as poet from the beginning
But from the days of reckoning
I used to offer sweet cake thoughts
Based on pure imagery and sight
"It is not enough" my conscious revolted
What good is the purpose when stated?
I was puzzled at receiving no reply
But I left no sincere try
The poets are not helpless
Or spent force
They have something to bank upon
And rightly come over to score and win
So let people take you as stature of no importance
But you shall find it as golden chance
When your articles find good place
In hearts of millions
