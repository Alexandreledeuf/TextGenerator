Well knit imagery
Where beautiful scenery
Takes place all around
The flowers are on ground
Who stops from remaining happy?
Even if one is not at all ready?
The timing should be made correct
Then must be injected into an act
I find poet well beyond
Boundary and
Dreaming about moon
To be bathed soon
To certain extent, I prefer to go
But come down with wind's blow
That suggests reality
With powerful blessings from an almighty
Poetry does not mean use good words alone
The sequence should also be carefully done
One needs to be fully convinced as lay man
After all we are simple human
I would love and care
But remain with poor
Who daily dreams about bright sun
But for bread has to toil and run
