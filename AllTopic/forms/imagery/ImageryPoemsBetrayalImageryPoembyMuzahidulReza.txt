You are my flower garden
Full of plants, flowers, beauty and smell
A paradise to me
I take care of you beautifying more,
But to garden you I had to labor a lot
Possessing the land
Digging, leveling, weeding out
Putting manure, fertilizer
Watering, planting saplings
Hedging, fencing and more,
People said it would be difficult to garden
As the land was quite unsuitable
But I was laboring hard and waiting
Finally I did impossible possible,
Now you are a full garden
But behave like some humans betraying
You cannot bear me entering, smelling, plucking
You want accompanying, serving other,
I cannot understand what happening
How my garden is possessed by other!
