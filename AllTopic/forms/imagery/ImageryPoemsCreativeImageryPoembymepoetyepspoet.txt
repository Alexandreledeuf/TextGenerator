You create thoughts
visions from your rife imagination
single ones will love to share
what you deem to create
in the wildest of dreams
they can't imagine
how love can simply flow
from a single glow
and
seed electric currents
of such high voltage
none can hope to blow
creative imagination continues
decent lovers still try to find
creative imagination
love is a creation
of the human mind
some are lusty
many and most
are still of gentle and kind
creating lover's imagination
the youthful of all
creating lovers imagination
where will we still find
such lovely ones
to keep in the inner closets
of one's brazened mind
