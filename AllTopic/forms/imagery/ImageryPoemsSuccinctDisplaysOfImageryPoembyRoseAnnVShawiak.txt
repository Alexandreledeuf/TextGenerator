Writing to rhythms, bringing a smile to a soul and spirit,
totally immersed in a bluened light of the Divine, mind
open, generating thoughts and ideas into intellect.
Guiding lines of prose and poetry into succinct displays
of imagery that define a poet's life, seeing it for what
it is and its temporary stance in this world.
Making the best of all things throughout the years, enjoy-
ing all the facts of a finite life and loving that it will
end in heaven.
