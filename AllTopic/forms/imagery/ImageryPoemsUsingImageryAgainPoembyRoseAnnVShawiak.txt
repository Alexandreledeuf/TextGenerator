Sitting here in a void, filling it with prayer and
spirituality while my friend is having surgery right
now.
Keeping him in mind, using imagery to visualize his
surgery as I pray that the surgeons, anesthesiologist
and nurses take care of him explicitly and properly.
Knowing that he'll be fine as he is in God's hands
protected and being given everything to help him re-
cover.
