Here we war;
for this junction we purse
seeing the troop we laugh;
upon our fortune; we smile
The earth move; we race
the bird sing, we made the chorus
for the seas and river we cross;
cold and deep it was.
The music from the guiter they play;
strong enough to send men to sleep
the cento they resite in rolls;
not too weak to wake men from bed.
