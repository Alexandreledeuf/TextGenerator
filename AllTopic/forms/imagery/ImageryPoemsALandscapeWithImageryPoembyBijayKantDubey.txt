The marshy plot of land, full of green grass, mud and water,
The small-small, white-white cows grazing,
The white-white lilies abloom,
The storks and cranes alighting,
Moving near-near the white cows,
The small-small Indian breed cows.
The lilies fair and white, chiselled with the landscape
Solitary and secluded,
The small-small cows grazing deep into,
The cranes and storks alighting,
Moving nearer,
Going together with
And flapping the wings.
The white-white cows, the white-white lilies, the white-white cranes and storks,
Things looking lovelier
On a green spot, the marshy plot of land!
