Back of imagery
We call a day from early morning
That brings sun light for all human beings
I was reading many reviews
Suddenly I thought of few personalities
Nobody was struck in mind
And I tried to find
What shall be going on in thinking?
My mind got onto it and started sinking
Here was simple but intelligent woman
Capable of writing on human pattern
I changed my focus on her face
It was altogether calm and at peace
The innocent smile
That rushed for a while
Brought her at comparison to moon
That was to set in straight after sun was going down
The silvery light shall not shadow
And she will grow
Even in dark
As her mind shall be at work again
Normally imagination starts
As in the form of an art
The poets and imagination make it like mercury
With all the colors at back of imagery
