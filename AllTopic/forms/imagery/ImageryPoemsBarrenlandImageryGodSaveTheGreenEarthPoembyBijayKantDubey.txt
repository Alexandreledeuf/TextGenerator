Will life come to a close
As they keep saying about the heat wave and the cold wave
Taking their toll by turn,
The soaring temperature
Rising abnormally?
Are these happening as for global warming
And climate change,
Will the coming summer be unbearable,
Intensive heat will fall
And from which,
There will be no respite?
Global warming, green house effect,
The ecological disbalance,
Deforestation and desertion
Keep adding to our woes
And we are anxious about our uncertain future.
What will it happen tomorrow,
Will life not exist on earth,
Will it come to a close,
Will the green earth turn into a barren land,
God knows, man cannot answer?
Acid rain,
It will rain acid as for poisnous gases
Emitted from our factories and automobiles,
Fuels are also getting exhausted,
Has the doomsday come,
The time for a cataclysmic disater?
The atomic summer seems to keep banging at the door,
A life cursed by radiation,
Nuclear radiation
When the radio-actives will be all around
The place we dwell in,
Resulting in fatal, deadly
And life-threatening ailments.
A world bereft of trees, other species of creatures
And greenery,
How can we imagine
And think of,
A world bereft of all its scenic and natural beauty
If it turns into a waste land, a barren land to dwell in?
