Dreams-imagery world

It is better we come to the conclusion
and remove the confusion
about the dream with illusions
and factors leading to the compulsion
dreams are after all dreams
they are flowing in the form of beam
lighting the brain all the time
and realizing it sometimes
person builds imagery world
and remains within same fold
he doesn't let the grip to be loosened
and works hard for it to happen
if dreams are confined
and kept without being defined
that is not likely to materialize
all the hopes are going to be dashed
dreams are built around capability
and that depends on the capacity
of a person who goes after it
and feels fit to dream of success
