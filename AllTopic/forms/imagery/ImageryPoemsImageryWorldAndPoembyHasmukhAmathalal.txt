Imagery world and
Friday,27th December 2019
I only can imagine
and take deep divine
i have nothing special
to dream as an individual
nothing changes even if I wish
and finish
it with my own colors
it gives me satisfaction with an honor
I extend my hand
it is turned down as friend
is this an end?
has love and affection no positive trend?
No, I press more
I must explore
wherever I find the space
and move ahead with steady pace
Love must win
and create favorable scene
even if you build an imagery bridge
there is something new write on the page
just dream about your world
and live in the fold
where you have so much to feel and fill
only you must have the positive thinking and strong will
