Long, long  ago
I broke the imagery
With the post modern
Random bombing
Of events, the little
Sweet bird of my mind
Can not perch on a single
Branch, moves
From cave to cave,
Can not concentrate
Dragging from one
Point to another,
Disconnected.
The gust of wind
Blowing him away
The flash flood
Unplugged him
From the root.
In the canvas
the complex
Photo copy of
The worries and anxieties
Emotions â€¦
Broken, fragmented
Volcanic and abrupt
Intense, rough
Tempted and wild.
Stormed and haunted
Souls run after illusions.
Bleeding heart can not
Focus,  tears lost
Colors, negatives
Can not give  you any more
The images or photographs.
