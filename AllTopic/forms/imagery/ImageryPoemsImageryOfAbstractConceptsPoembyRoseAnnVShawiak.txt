Straying into outlines of life, exploring their assets,
hoping to find new ideas and thoughts lying about in
recesses of my mind.
Curiosity having free rein to question, while learning
new aspects and focusing light into intellect of how or
why some things work or are regulated.
Always thinking, supplying intellect with new information
to be used in forming new concepts that may perhaps enter-
tain ways of achieving technological advances.
Using imagery of abstract concepts and blending them with
reality of life and imagination, bringing about innovative
inventions in the future to help humanity.
