I read some innocent comments
on sexy poetry of PH poets
They remain silent
to avoid controversy
I have been a poet
since decades so many
there is no smoke without a fire
so poets add sugar nectar
and
when they want to make it spicy
add salt and pepper
can ever a child be born
without human seeds
all men and poets
love to breed
can a woman deny
having a desire
by devouring seeds
of a hubby
and
if impotent
aboy friend lover's
just let me any poet of PH
tellme truthfully
are you ready
