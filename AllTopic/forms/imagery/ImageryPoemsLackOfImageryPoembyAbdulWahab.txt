The stark difference between rich and poor
Has its serious takers in India than Europe and North America
But poor fellows along with poets
Do not have images to show off
So writings after writings come out
But none of them get any success,
poor remains poor
Rich gets richer widening chasm more
Literature does not have effects upon politics
And politicians do not understand literature
Culprit is not resources or intention
It is for the poor fellow writers who fails to portray vivid images.
