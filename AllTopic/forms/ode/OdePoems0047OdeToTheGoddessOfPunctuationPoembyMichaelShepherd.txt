I sing of punctuation....'What? ', you say,
'I've never heard a sonnet on that theme! ';
and thus this modest goddess, clothed in grace,
performs her holy task; unheard, unseen,
except in trivial printed marks (- like this -)
punctilious editors put in - or erase;
yet, she's the Sherpa to the mind's high bliss
who leads our thoughts to peaks of silent praise;
immortal consort of the god of speech,
handmaid of mind, bestowing measured pause
between each thought; their silent truth to reach
by resting mind in mind's divine true cause.
O worship her, her power so great and blest,
whose shortest silence, wildest mind may rest!
