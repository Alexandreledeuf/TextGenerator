Pitter patter -what's the matter?
Can't go out and play?
Pitter patter - getting madder -
Hate this rainy day;
Thunder, lightning  - it's so frightening!
Let's go run and hide,
Find a place that's warm and cozy -
Leave the storm outside;
Splish splash - lightning flash!
Between the drops of rain,
Tumbling like a waterfall
Down the window pane;
Something sort of comforting
Listening to the rain -
Pitter patter, skitter skatter -
Like my thoughts today -
Washing out the cobwebs
Is refreshing  - let's go play!
