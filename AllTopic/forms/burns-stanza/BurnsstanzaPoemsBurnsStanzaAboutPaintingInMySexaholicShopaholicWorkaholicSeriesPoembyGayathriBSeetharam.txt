Burns Stanza about Painting in my Sexaholic Shopaholic Workaholic Series
-Gayathri B. Seetharam
Wikipedia says that a Burns Stanza has to have the rhyme scheme AAABAB with tetrameter A lines and dimeter B lines (meter is a unit of rhythm in poetry, a pattern of the beats. Meter is also called a foot and each foot has a certain number of syllables in it) .
As an artist who is a Sexaholic, I have made a fabric painting of a Khajuraho temple sculpture
I love sex but am not an addict and I must confess that painting the male organ and the breasts of the symbolic me was very erotic
While the black colour on the grey cloth formed a nice outline, the amethyst and green colours formed a lovely contrast
As a Shopaholic, I have used my paint brush to make many buys of painting materials
And made a haven that an atheist would crave, all subjects objectified but not a painting of God, the Almighty
As a Workaholic, I do not spare my own blushes when I say I have made many beautiful paintings.
