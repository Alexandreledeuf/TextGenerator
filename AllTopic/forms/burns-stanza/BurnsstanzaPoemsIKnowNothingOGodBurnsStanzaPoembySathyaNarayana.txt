What's good, know not. What's bad, as well,
know not. But lo, my heart does swell
with love, O' Lord and eyes do well
when hear your name.
And why my lips always drivel
Your tales and fame?
I try no logic Lord. No doubt
as well I entertain about
Your greatness, since my brain isn't stout
and faith, just blind.
These songs I sing and pleas I shout
are undefined.
Wisdom is no wisdom; they say,
unless it lays a floral way
to reach, at last, your sacred quay.
But what's wisdom?
Know not I; but belongs my clay
to Your kingdom.
