Fluttering with a broken wing
or diving with a voice that ring,
like a mad little flying thing
a plover bombards me,
before again it is rising
trying to make me flee
and I am astounded by it
drawing me away bit by bit
or in anger catching a fit
as I near the small nest,
falling down as if it is hit;
to be leaving seems best.
