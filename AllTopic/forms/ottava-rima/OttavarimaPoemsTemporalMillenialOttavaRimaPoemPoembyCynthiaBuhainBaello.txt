They like to call themselves the new Millenials
Upbeat youth so drunk in selfie 'Me first' trend,
They're like the fly on the cow's back for a while
Thinks it's taller than the beast, youth has no end-
Rebels never knowing life is temporal
Tomorrow to the grave Death may choose to send
Their prideful plans in selfie paths demised
Entitled?  All men meet the end... undisguised.
