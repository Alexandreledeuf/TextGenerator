My writing is like an essential food
That I need to take in like a deep breath,
Words on a blank page to be understood
By a reader,  like a feast he can get.
The mind's creative juices, the heart's mood,
Are ingredients of a meal I may set,
Yet all these from the Giver of the pen
Because it's a life gift He has given.
