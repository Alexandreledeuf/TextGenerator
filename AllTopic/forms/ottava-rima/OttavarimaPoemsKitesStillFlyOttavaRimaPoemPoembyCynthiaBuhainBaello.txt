Carefree paper kites soar with childhood dreams
Still in my mind a distant merriment,
Echoes of our laughter and glee it seems
Return with their lost mirth and enchantment.
Kites flying so free with innocent whims
Against the wind they play in contentment,
Tender images of our jovial days,
A time when our world was not tinged by grays.
