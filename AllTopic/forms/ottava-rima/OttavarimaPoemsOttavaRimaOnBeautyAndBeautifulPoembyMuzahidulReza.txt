Beauty is truth without any condition
But humans need conditions to be beautiful,
Purity, chastity, honesty, equity in equation
Are the first conditions to be beautiful,
Some more positive virtues just come then
Like hatred for none but love for equally all,
Socially prideless looking, harmonious dealing
Democratic, humanitarian mind having.
