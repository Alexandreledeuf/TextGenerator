Something about her can simply appeal
That silent magical attractiveness,
An inner soft glow one can surely feel
Like a hushed breath of wind in gentleness.
Natural woman, no pretense, so real-
Demure and shy, she leaves one speechless,
Lovely eyes speak waves of serenity
Our world lost the essence of such beauty.
