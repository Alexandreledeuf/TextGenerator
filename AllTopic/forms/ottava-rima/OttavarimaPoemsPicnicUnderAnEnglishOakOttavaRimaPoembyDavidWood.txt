We meander through meadows of blazing corn
Sit under ancient oaks now dry in the sun
The dry hot summer making flowers forlorn
An everlasting drought that that took all the fun
Under its canopy in the early morn
We sit entwined our two hearts beating as one
Thoughts of love flowing rampantly through my head
But the sight of your husband filled me with dread
