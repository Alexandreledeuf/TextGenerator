Oisin, my love I shall ever wait for you
In the misty lands of the forever young
Away to the green hills of Ireland you flew
To find peace on the isle of the setting sun
Set no foot on the mortal soil you once knew
Or age replaces the youth to which you've clung
So ride ever swift and dare not touch the ground
'Till you are home far beneath the fairy mounds
