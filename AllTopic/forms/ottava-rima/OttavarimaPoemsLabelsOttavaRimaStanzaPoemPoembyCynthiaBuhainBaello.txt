In the fifty's there was the odd group beatniks
The sixty's flower people, non-conformists,
Against the tide, they don labels quite unique
Each decade spells their rebel's cause in a gist.
I find these fleeting trends a little tragic,
Like rambling fate anchored on a fading mist.
For hard Work and Persistence still take us there
Labels are not good when they can't deliver.
