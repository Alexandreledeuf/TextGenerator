the snow falls on my fathers' bed
on the foot
on the head
the snow falls on my fathers' bed
all the night and morning long
my fathers' bed is in the ground
his sleep is deep
his sleep is sound
my fathers' bed is in the ground
na will he soon awaken
his earthly day was not so long
but thirty year
or very near
his earthly day was not so long
the reason more to mourn him
the devil took him by the hand
and turned him on
to heroin
the devil took him by the hand
and that is why he's gone
softly on the dreaming land
sifts and blows
the gleaming snow
softly on the weeping land
and on my fathers' stone
the snow falls on my fathers' bed
on the foot
on the head
the snow falls on my fathers' bed
all the night and morning long.
