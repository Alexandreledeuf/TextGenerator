Look at me!
I’m so old
And tattered and battered;
Made so by the unceasing
Blows of Time.
I have been here for
Millions of years,
A witness to it all.
I have been used and abused
Inhumanly by the humans
Inhabiting my very bosom.
I have done much
For them all.
I have spent myself—
All of myself.
I cannot replenish myself any more.
I gave them my all,
Yet I am uncared for,
Left to fend for myself.
How I wish I had been
A master and not a slave!
Unleashed my fury more often
And revealed my power.
Not Mother Nature but
A tyrannous step mother!
