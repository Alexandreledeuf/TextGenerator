I was a President,
Yes, I too was a White House resident,
However, short my tenure,
I did have a great deal of pleasure,
Leading our nation,
Driving our country,
Putting a Ford in the driver's seat,
After Watergate was quit a relief,
However, when I look back,
I have but one regret,
I would take that pardon back!
