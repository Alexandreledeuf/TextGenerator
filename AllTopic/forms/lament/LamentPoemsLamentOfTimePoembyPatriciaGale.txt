Oh for the time when love was young
And the lines that cross my brow were far from me
That the song of passion could once again sing in my soul
But alas I must be riddled with the truth
Passion is but for young maidens who have youth in their eyes
Perhaps it is the payment brought forth for love that was given and I did not return
Ah what has befallen me that I may forever in my last days never feel the touch of a man who’s hands desire my being and his heart mesmerized with  my love?
The room filled with many... But yet loneliness encompasses by being.
Did I not obey well and treasure the gift of love?
Am I to complete my service alone and never again feel the warmth of desire?
Aye…Time you are so cruel
Will it be that on the other side I should know the feel of love once more?
Perhaps it be well that this curse of passion course through my soul with no one to share it with
Aye… time you be so cruel
My soul cries out with silent tears
But alone they come forth like a rushing tide
Blurring the vision of hope and quenching the fire that once burned high
Mother of Love why have you forsaken the one you borne this in?
Mine lament to carry through out this cold life
Time why has thou taken me?
I shall put forth my time a bid love be gone from this heart
And this life solemn till my final breath I draw
Time take me far unto the light were I may once again forsake this curse
