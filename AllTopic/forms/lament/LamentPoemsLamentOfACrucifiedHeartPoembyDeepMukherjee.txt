Mind - an enigma;
To decipher the code
The code of deception! !
Words - an enigma;
A precarious polymorphism
A mutable chameleon! ! !
Lurking amid darkness;
Behind the face of angel
The eyes of apocalypse! !
Deceit of your advent
Deceit of your freedom
A deceit - long figured up! ! !
A silken bond of trust
Torn apart by the dagger
Again again and again! !
Confined in the void;
Amid the world of your lies
I'm losing my grasps again! ! !
In this game of shadows
And this road of desolation;
I will always be the haunted one! !
Go easy on my conscience
Pain flowing through my veins
You are the drug to ease the pain! ! !
Mind - an enigma;
You are the undeciphered code
The code of salvation! !
Words - an enigma;
Utter those three words again
Three words of rejuvenation! ! !
