Words, words, words dancing in my head,
It usually happens when I've just gone to bed,
They toss around til I can no longer sleep;
And my thoughts become crowded when in those words creep;
So up I get to pen them down,
Sometimes they even cause me  to wear a frown,
It's like a curse that  haunts & plays with my mind,
But once complete my poems do leave me  joy behind;
So onward the words begin to grow with a definite flow;
And then  I can only hope it makes me a better poet as I go.
