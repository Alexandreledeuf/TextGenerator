I could have moved him
If he could hear how loud
my heart was beating
I could have touched him
But he could not feel much
beyond his pale skin
I could have loved him
But he was blind and could not read
my broken lines
I went through the motions
Drowning in an ocean
A dead sea...
He kept on looking past me
