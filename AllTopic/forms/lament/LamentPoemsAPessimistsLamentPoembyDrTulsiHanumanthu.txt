Life, they say, if full of wonder;
Mine is full of storm and thunder.
Life, they say, is a tuneful song;
Shrieks discordant mine do throng.
Life, they say, with honey drips;
Mine, my tears is made to sip.
Life, they say, in nectar wades;
Sunk in poison mine is laid.
Life, they say, is heavenly bliss;
Mine is mobbed by snakes that hiss.
Life, they say, is paeans' surge;
Mine is but a woeful dirge.
