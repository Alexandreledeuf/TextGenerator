Wherefore awakest thou,
.................................... oh mine heart?
Thy lover hast taken
................................. thine every part
And left but a shell.
But markest thou well,
Cupid hast many another dart.
It will be mustered
.......................... and aimed forthwith,
T'ward that ungrateful wretch,
......................................and thus give
This very same pain.
And happen again
He cometh, henceforth
.......................  wilt find me heartless.
