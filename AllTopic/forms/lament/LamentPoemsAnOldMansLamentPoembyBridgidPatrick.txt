Just a line to say I'm living,
that I'm not among the dead,
though I'm getting more forgetful
and mixed up in the head.
I got used to my arthritis,
to my dentures I'm resigned,
I can manage my bifocals
but God I miss my mind,
For sometimes I can't remember,
when I stand at the foot of the stairs,
if I must go up for something,
or have just come down from there.
And before the fridge so often,
my poor mind is filled with doubt,
have I just put food away,
or have I come to take some out?
So if it's my turn to write to you,
there's no need for getting sore,
I may think that I have written
and don't want to be a bore.
So, remember that I love you
and wish that you were near
but now it's nearly mail time
so I must say good-bye dear,
There I stand beside the mailbox
with a face so very red,
instead of mailing you my letter,
I opened it instead!
