Her life had always been one in which a door would close
And another door or two would open...
Today she awoke and sighed with defeated weakness....
Pale and mortally exhausted by her diseased beliefs
Not even a window of opportunity was to open
For as is with everything in life....
She had reached the very end....
Beyond which she herself had believed nothing existed
All doors to her tomb had now been sealed___
