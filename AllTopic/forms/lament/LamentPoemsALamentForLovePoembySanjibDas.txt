O Love! O Life! O Time!
On whose last steps I climb,
Shaking at what where I had stood before;
When will return the glory of your prime?
No more - oh, never more
Out of the day after day
A sense of love has taken flight:
Fresh morning, and evening, and night hoar
Move my faint heart with grief, but with delight
No more - oh, never more!
