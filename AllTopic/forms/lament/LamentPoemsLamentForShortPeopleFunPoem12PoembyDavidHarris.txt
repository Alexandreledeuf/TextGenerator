Even a tall person to a short person,
their problems I can relate,
tall people bump into low hanging doors,
while short people cannot reach shelves too high.
In shops there are no normal shelves,
some are near the ceiling,
while others are inches from the floor.
Normally the good stuff is put on the top shelf,
where you need a pair of stilts to reach.
Therefore, the short person has to jump up and down,
just like a jack in the box,
for anything they want.
Some short people feel intimidated,
by the tall people that they meet.
They should not be,
because size is not the difference,
but its personalities.
Now if they worked together,
they could walk at the same height.
No man is different from another,
no matter what size he is.
So short and tall people of this word,
I have but one word for both of you - unite.
