Who rules the master,
Who serves the slave?
Who tries to linger?
Who tries to leave?
Whose is the victory
When triumphs are done?
The Circus is empty,
the Forum forlorn.
Whose hero's boat
Hoists a black sail?
Whose bones are  found
At Choisin Reservoir?
Why do we sigh,
Why do we mourn?
The evening sky
Shall take us all home.
Yet, as the sunset fades,
Friendships ascend:
Fragile words compass
Time without end.
