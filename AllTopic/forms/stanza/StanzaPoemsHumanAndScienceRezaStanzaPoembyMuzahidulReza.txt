(Human And Science - Reza Stanza)
Humans have come with much science in
And out and in many levels,
Each level is containing
Sections and sections of serials;
As, an inner small limb, in fact
Is too major a chapter
Compared to a part of world outer.
Science is found by them everywhere
So they can be the scientists,
But to be so thoughts require
From nature and more experiments;
Every object and animal
Invite some thoughtful human,
"Be scientists and open hidden".
