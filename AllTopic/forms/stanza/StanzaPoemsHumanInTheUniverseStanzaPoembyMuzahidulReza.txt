Ever rounding
And ever full
With beings, objects
For each and all the subjects,
So vast, so large
Puzzled to measure
Immeasurable dimension
Creator is on its succession,
Some say this
And some say that
But, what is really fact?
Humans' brain is so limited,
Yet science knows
A very little of space
Though scientists are trying
Much perplexity they are facing,
So, eternal desire
And eternal attempts
Shall ever work behind
To know its every new point.
