Slack water. The tide turns
A ripple in the undergrowth.
The Eagle now abandons
His suspended silence
As wings fold and the waves
Fold over the level shore.
Drake's drum beats
In my brow its Alexandrines
Calls up my quixotic being.
And who is she, my metronome,
Stilettos clicking on the prom?
I turn again as does the tide
To meet a glancing eye.
There is no pain in dreaming!
