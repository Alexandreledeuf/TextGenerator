When graced by thee I was in love.
I loved the simple things you'd do.
You were mine, and I was yours too.
You seemed harmless just like a dove.
We spent long nights on the phone
Saying sweet things pleasing to hear.
I didn’t think the end was so near.
You left me with a heart of stone.
Do not tell me I am your love,
And you can't control what you think.
Because of you, of hatred I stink!
I wish you hell - I wish to shove...
My heart you made become dark,
So in fiery words it fumes.
I wish you not joy, but tombs,
Bitterness and its cursed marks.
To you I gave my heart in full;
You shredded it - I have none left.
To compassion I am now deaf.
Broken, I see, I am a fool.
For through it all, I still love you,
And the things I say I do not mean.
It’s a weak heart being obscene.
Despite the hurt, I still love you.
