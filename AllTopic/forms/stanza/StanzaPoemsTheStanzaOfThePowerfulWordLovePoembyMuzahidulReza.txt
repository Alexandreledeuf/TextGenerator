Love is in the world a powerful word
Know only the lover and the beloved
From where it comes
Composing some romance in verses
Singing some unheard songs
Whispering some sweet words
To unite the two minds
In a single, one point;
A motion, an emotion and a feeling
Comes by shaking heart
Thrilling mind, absorbing brain
Enthusiastic tears shedding;
Increasing power where is no power
Of will, ambition, determination;
Increasing motion where is no motion
Of soul, spirit, five senses;
So when they hear the word
Senses are instantly sensed,
With heavenly pleasures mind is filled
Thirst is instantly quenched,
Hunger is instantly satisfied
With the joy of to love and to be loved,
Such real love has nothing to lose
Such real love does never get lost.
