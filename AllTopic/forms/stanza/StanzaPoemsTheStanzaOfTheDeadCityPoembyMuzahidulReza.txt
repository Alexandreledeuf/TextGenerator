A lot of skyscrapers, big cities are now worldwide seen
The vast areas without trees joined with dead pin,
Stones and sands tightly cover irons
Irons, stones and sands capture humans,
Humans are strongly tied to the iron poles
But proud of inventing the modern alls;
Machines and media are their life companions
With some dry food, dry movements, dry emotions
They somehow but luxuriously pass times
Machines do the works they sit like machines
Machines and humans form union
Counter attack goes in man to man, nation to nation,
To check it they heed on some plans
The machines are developed in weapons
Machines, humans, and weapons now exchange feedback
I am afraid if mutual reactions make the world hack,
Dry emotions have succeeded to fail man understand man
And make them very fond of ultra-modern gun,
So they deal in guns, atom, hydrogen bombs
Multi harmful gunpowder and chemical weapons,
To throw these powers worldwide on humans
They have invented missiles, fighters and cannons,
To make wide wide grave yard in all the dead cities
They are busy to fall the rest of the green earth in crises,
To remove the darkness from the dead cities
They are exploding powers for radiation produces
And frequently flying in the air to explore the whole earth
To see how much they have advanced in plan and math.
