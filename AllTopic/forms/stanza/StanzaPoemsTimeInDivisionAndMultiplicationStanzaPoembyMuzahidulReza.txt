The seven days of each week are coming by turns
As a great system of night and day and time division,
One day is divided by a certain number
Again multiplied by a certain number
To get certain division and multiplication of time,
In our world day is the great unit of time
Hour, minute and second are the division of day
Month, week, year and century are the multiplication of day,
Some regional alternatives of day and night exist
As, in the two poles, a 24 hours, sunny or dark a day is fixed.
