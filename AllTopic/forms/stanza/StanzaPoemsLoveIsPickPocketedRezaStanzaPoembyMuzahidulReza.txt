Love Is Pick Pocketed - Reza Stanza
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
In this large city there is no love
And so I request my close friend
To buy for me some true love
Who is just going to foreign land;
When he returned from the long trip
I asked for my precious gift
He said, "Bought but was pick pocketed."
