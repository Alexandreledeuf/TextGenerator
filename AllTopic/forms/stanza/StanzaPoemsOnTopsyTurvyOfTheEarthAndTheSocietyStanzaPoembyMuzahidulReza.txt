Miraclely or abruptly this earth was not got
Stage after stage and in many stages
It took topsy-turvy inward and outward
Got reversed up and down, round and round
One of the causes of extinction of the inhabitants
Many ancient races and plants extincted forever
Lot of human civilizations sank into soil and water
For they had committed crimes and causes
From the first human Adam to Mohamed (pbh)
Those provements are found after excavations
The relics are seen even under the ice of two poles
Under the mountains of the Himalayas, the Alps
Under the sea bed of the Pacific, the Atlantic
Soil essence, stone, rock are the strong examples,
From the topsy-turvy of the earth many were lost
Again it formed many resources underground
Mine resources are the result of those turning forms
On which this modern civilizations stand;
At every normal position of the earth
Human societies form from ancient to present
Governed by various types of governors
King, monarch, dictator, aristocrat, democrat
Thus, in changing different governors, once
A blissful grove with flowing stream it was
Some towering spirits handled in proper ways
Pure perception always pervaded them,
The departmental representatives and agents
That was real democracy in fact,
Things happened orderly and flawlessly
Supremacy predominated and baseless doomed
Majority was over minority but equally honored,
As inside the garden flowers bloomed
Far, near, respectively all around smell spread
Owners, neighbors all breathed equally,
Tranquility surrounded to make all soothed
In blossoming, flowing, tweeting paradise on earth.
