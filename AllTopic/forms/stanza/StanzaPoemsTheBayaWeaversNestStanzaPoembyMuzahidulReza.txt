With some ordinary straws, blades of grasses and leaves
Applying wonderful skills, techniques and strategies
The pair happily weave a beautiful nest,
With a door, hollow inside, much soft and fantastic to look at;
This small nest is as their hut
Loving each other they set their dreamy, longing world
Full of muse, ecstasy, sensuousness and expectation
Centralizing which round the two lives' wheels best;
Two eggs the mother bird lays
Father and mother both sit on the eggs,
Soon the two chicks come out of the hard shell of eggs
Raising head to the sky they open their beaks
That makes inside the tender mouths cute gap for food,
Collecting food hurriedly the parents return to put the first food
In the young chicks' adorable mouths
And caress, dandle, fondle uttering loving sounds, "aan, aan".
