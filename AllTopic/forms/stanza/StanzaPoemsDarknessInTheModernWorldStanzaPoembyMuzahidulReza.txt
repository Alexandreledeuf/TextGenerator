Darkness in the modern world just under light
So light has been dim and darkness has been deep
Lamps and media are always kept on and open
But things and information are often unseen and unknown;
Things and ideas are anyhow done and supposed
Inserting some techniques on glaring themes posed
Mysterious and horrible spots are worldwide formed
Without knowing causes where modern humans fight;
On some baseless and false ideas wars are called
Nations, civilizations fall, get deformed and destroyed
Then they apologize for ideas and wars wrongly committed
By them humanity is refused only humans are stored;
Ineligible are made eligible to make no rules rules
To loose crimes and corruption commonly all over the world
One half is maltreated, oppressed live below human levels
The rest are treated beyond of all wrongs and trials;
What are happening around the world, society now?
Truth spoken mouths, right hands are chained anyhow,
Fire burns water at large, water vaporizes in thirst
Toads engulf venomous snakes, snakes but get lost;
Power holders say, 'Observe and listen everything
Live, leave or die you like but don't say anything
We have grasped the earth gradually and absolutely
Putting out lights we'll play death game in dark finally.'
