The Charisma Of Aurora (Reza Stanza)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Aurora spreads multi colored light
The light spreads so charming beauties,
Keen aroma beauties spread
That charisma muse my five senses;
The two poles play this truth beauty
What leads some to the right path
And causes some stray from the right path.
