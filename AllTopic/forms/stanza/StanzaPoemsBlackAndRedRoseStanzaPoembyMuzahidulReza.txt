The world is the vast garden of roses
Every moment a blooms and a falls
One laughs and other cries
Beside the empty stalks;
Yet my friend asks
Whether I am fond of red or black ones,
I see both bloom in the garden
In name and qualities are same
Only color is different
Yet I face the question.
