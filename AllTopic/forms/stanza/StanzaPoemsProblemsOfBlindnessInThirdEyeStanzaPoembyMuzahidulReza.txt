Flowers bloom in nature and garden
To spread beauty, smell in the region,
Some flowers last only for few days
That before our two mortal eyes,
Some flowers only bloom and fall
By everyday's eternal rule and call,
Another immortal eye that we have
Always gives the most of us ever gap,
So from flowers we only take pleasure
Using, smelling and looking at the flower.
