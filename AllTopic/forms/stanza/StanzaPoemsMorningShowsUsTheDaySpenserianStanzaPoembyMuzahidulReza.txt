You often say night causes you much sad
So, you are too frightened of this dark night,
I say night is to sleep and take rest and
It recovers beings' physical hurt,
To many, it too removes mental plight
Through deep meditation and long prayer;
And when you do wake up you will get that
You have breathed a long sigh of relief here
And your fear you see has fled from you forever;
Now you can see the beautiful morning
In breeze blossoming and leaves' dancing there
Fragrance and beauty they all are spreading
To fill surroundings with purity, fair;
For these, the birds are singing everywhere
The bees are rushing, buzzing to and fro
For collecting the essence of flower
On colorful wings the butterflies grow
The celestial scene for today and tomorrow;
Still the sun over there has not risen
The sun will rise with more fun and power
To supply with enough warm and to lighten
For lives which undeniably require,
With the sunrise for livings lives scatter
You will see quick rushing, lively noises
Agitate every life in the earth here
Earth orbits the sun in mirth and muses,
Thus morning generally shows how day passes;
Again, a morning also often starts
With thundering, flashing, storming, raining;
The sky is covered with thick black, grey clouds
In vast periphery no hope is seen;
In our earth what an alternative scene!
Sometimes nature is great and laughs brightly
Sometimes, is quite unfavorable seen
Day is tensed, so thing can be done hardly
Lives face almost from all the ways difficulty.
