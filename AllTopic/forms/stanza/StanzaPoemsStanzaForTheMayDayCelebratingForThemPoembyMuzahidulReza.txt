Lito, a boy of twelve was walking along
An old, broken street of the sun browned,
Dusts attached, smoke emitting town
Lonely, long way he was passing
Through heat waves, bad odor,
Horn blaring, noisy, charmless morning,
At noon leaves were falling around
Environment turned into dry, harsh
In the shadowless just new desert
Rubbishes gathered here and there
Old vehicles splashed dirty water to him
He was bored, tired, exhausted but silent;
He halted under a tall building
In a five feet tall paper roofed square hut
An old woman was there lying on the soil
Mother, the only alive person in his world
He began taking care of her carefully
But she closed her eyes for last
At that loving and caring face he stared
Then the vacant world in front of him,
Some people from nearby orphanage came
For funeral and praying salvation for the soul
By the evening all of them went away
Nobody was to care of the boy;
Night fell on, deep darkness in and out
His eyes went wet for the whole night,
Heart shed blood,
But two leaps bit each other tightly;
A storm rose at early dawn
He was alarmed, scared
Dirty water from the roof of the tall building
Drenched him, storm damaged his hut
And flew him away at a mill gate,
And entangled him with a wheel there,
The inborn work managed his luck,
Now he is a mill man like other men
Toiling whole day with a small break
In a risky environment,
Enjoying healthy diet is rare in nasty slum,
Happiness, sadness, solvency, poverty
Are unknown to him
He is indifferent or attentive is not perceived
He does not know how fun in life
No dear or fair one, he is all alone
No scope to find the meaning of life
In self sacrificing, obedient to owners' mind;
You, the owners and the employers
Are enjoying all the facilities
And neglecting them
For whom you are lucky today they are wretched,
Take the vows with mercy for them
To pay them properly in time,
Behave them well and feed them what you eat,
Ensure their rights and safety environment.
