No farmer, no land, no agricultural arrangements
No growing of vegetables, fish, meat, fruit and food
But in time I am supplied time out some of those
Produced by far rural peasant in their lands;
Natural sun and air outside but some electric lamps
And fans with some dusty and gusty air inside,
No cloud roaring, no thunder blasting in the sky
But the giants like vehicles are howling all times;
Noises and airs of this city have made me sick
Its four concrete walls have made me etherized,
Its stone and iron roofs have made me captive
It has made me a complete devoid and deprived
Of observing the open sky, the moon, the stars;
Of enjoying the touches of soft grasses and plants;
Of being in the colorful landscapes and environs;
Of looking at the innocent faces of the simple folks;
I need a very puff of fresh air to survive this very me
And to be free from all numbness and diseases,
Stored in my body, mind and brain living in cities
For that I have come towards you from those cities
My dear birthland and mother, now I am fully yours
Let me breathe a puff of your fresh, life saving air;
For my real life, less need those artificial equipments
For life, I do need some of your simple arrangements.
