Yesterday here was peace
Today everywhere chaos
What are you doing there leaders?
Setting all the forces
Breaking all the pillars;
When will you stop these?
We will sit together, yes
Recalling memory, drinking coffee
Watching the gardens
Full with charming flowers;
We see you are quite late
We are losing memory fact
Our coffee is turning cold and damn
The flowers are getting fallen
We are losing all and all.
