the boat that we are riding
towards an island
is chasing the sea and the sea
runs always faster than
where we are
until the waters hand us to
the sandy shore
when the running stops
but our minds do not just stop like that
it is not that simple
we tend to run as fast as the sea and this
thought
wanting to arrive on what we still
cannot grasp
