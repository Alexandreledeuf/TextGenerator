Biological drive is a hard thing to fight
And if nature has made you a male
Through your will or your crotch you are driven in life
To proverbial chasing of tail
Like a hound on a prowl finest prey you may stalk
Then get trapped being deceived by your senses
For those tails have been known to be wagging their dogs
And dispel with the strongest defenses
Then, sometimes things get tough when you're herding a bunch
You can't tell after who you are chasing
And as dust settles down, with the prize in your teeth
It's your own ass you'll be facing.
