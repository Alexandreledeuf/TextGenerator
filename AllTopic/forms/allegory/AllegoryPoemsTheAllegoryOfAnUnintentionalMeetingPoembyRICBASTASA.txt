the meeting was incisive
lie the way my tooth is relieved from pain
but he
thought about what i said before
that moment when
the glass was emptied of its black contents
that night inside a cube of ice
when what followed was the transparency
of air
when both sides can be seen at one glance
when goodbyes and hellos
look the same like Siamese twins
when one finally sees through a hole and for a while
glances like a window of rain where you cannot help but just stay as you do not like to dance
and then he
says that
the universe is there and it is
nothing at all
