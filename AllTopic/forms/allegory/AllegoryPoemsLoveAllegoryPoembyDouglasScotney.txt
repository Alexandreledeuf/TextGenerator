It was a warm and moonlit night
When ghostly, solemn light,
Doubting beauty in a breeze
And love outside of time,
Conspiring with the consequences,
Committed doubt to rhyme.
By early morning brilliant light
It was light that was out of time,
And love, hanging on a breeze,
Doing a beauty of a sneeze.
