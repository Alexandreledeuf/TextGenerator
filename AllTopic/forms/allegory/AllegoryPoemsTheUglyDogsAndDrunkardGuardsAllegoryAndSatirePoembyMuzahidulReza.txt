The Ugly Dogs And Drunkard Guards (Allegory And Satire)
May 28, 2020
No sooner had the sacks of rice released from godown
Than the butcher chased dogs snatched,
Biting the sacks they began to run here and there
But they could not fully tear,
Soon the ugly dogs were kicked and beaten
And the most of the sacks were rescued
Through a long harassment and bearing others' pain
By the dull headed, drunkard guards.
