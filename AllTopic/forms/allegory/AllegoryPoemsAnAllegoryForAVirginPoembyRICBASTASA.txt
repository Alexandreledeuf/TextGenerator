the eyes are submarines
every moment is a nighttime
beautiful sea creatures of
this mind
forever appeasing
first meetings of lovers
more like
it,
i refer to art, this is the one
that always brings a new day to me
sunshine is not the usual sunshine on the fields of hay
it is always new and
different
always the first time
virgins in bed
on love's unwearied imaginations
the eyes are submerged
seeing what is not here for the first time
clouds bluer than ever
rotated by a fan
suns hanging on the ceiling behave like the stars in those heavens
those trees shedding off leaves
upon a teasing wind
dogs howl, the rain comes like hair
upon the slender neck of a beloved
doors close, windows open, the house staying put upon love
and the star of the show is silence restrained
too much restraint
joy contained exclusively on those arms tightened
like a jet surging parting the tight legs of a virgin sky.
