when i was small
i was taught that the meaning
of my life
lies inside the big dome
it is where destiny lies
all explanations possible
are contained in that book
kept inside the golden
casing,
life turns sour
and bitter and
sweetness seems
to be slippery like
an eel,
the dome does not help
and so i turned away
walked outside
and found this new place
outside the dome
trees and grass and
some dragonflies
clouds and cones
fine mornings
calm seas
there are lots of shapes and
colors and
odors
more explanations become possible
they're born like buds turning into
petals
and freedom is like a child
running wild and
talking in chatters
so many songs
and poems
and conversations flow
without fences
i like it here
even without you
i am hurt
but it is different now
i have befriended the pebbles
and the sands
the sun is terrible
but on a night like this
the moon comes once in a while
bringing me
another sense and meaning
some stars sing
they help
