Under the vast expanse of a starless night,
A wolf pack travels, feral eyes gleaming bright.
Whispers have said, “They are monsters under your bed, ”
But they don’t itch to pick a fight.
They flee from the forest and scatter,
For they’re hounded for their rumored matter.
If they turn and defy, they either live or die,
And fear brings about the latter.
Fear drives people to the brink,
Where they think they know all there is to think.
Once judgment is passed, these things won’t last,
Difference is a poisonous drink.
(Note: Written September 23,2009. How many times do we judge people before we get to know them because of the vicious rumors people spread about them? In this poem, wolves are allegorically representative for people that are different than the homogeneous mixture of people society demands.)
