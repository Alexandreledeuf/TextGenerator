It's an all too common allegory
Pressed from the hands of time
Lent out silent praised theme
Careless whispers never hard to find
With redeeming qualities fading
An elevation of angers hot glow
Bitterness is the totality it's framing
Seperating rightous victims who know
Blazing through their transparent veils
The blame is countered with denial
Running rapidly from the inner problem's core
Slowing down but for a little while
At last catching up to the blameworthy
Who brazenly sit atop  the Moon
Arrogantly still in denial
Their rude awakening is coming soon
