Spontaneous - intimate obscurity
Suddenly an enlightened certitude trifles
Deep inside, the mind spreads out the landscape
Wide meadows, a quick gush of green
The endless sky shedding blue
And in the soil of time are being sowed chronicles.
Is this the legendary loam, the seeds of the century
That may turn into a tree of elegance?
Incessant downpour in human memory?
Continual motion
River within me
And the allegory of it, without.
