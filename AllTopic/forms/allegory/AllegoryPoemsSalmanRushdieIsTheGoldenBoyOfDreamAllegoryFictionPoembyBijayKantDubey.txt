Those who do not know Salman Rushdie must know it
He is the golden boy
Of dream, allegory and the narrative technique,
Comics is his chief property
With which regales and jokes he,
Caricatures and comments
And criticizes,
An Indian, an Asiatic man
He tells about the adjusting and life-style
Of the immigrants and expatriates
Naturalized and domiciled in foreign,
How far Indian are those who live abroad,
The diaspora dais, dislocation and displacement,
The refugee problem, cultural ethnicity,
The quest for identity,
Settlement and re-settlement.
