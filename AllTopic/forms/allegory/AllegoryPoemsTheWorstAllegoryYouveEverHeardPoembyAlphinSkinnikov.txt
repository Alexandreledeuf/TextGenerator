A moth fancied a butterfly
Alas, the butterfly was coy
She fluttered through the daisies
And he sputtered in the tulips
Forgetting all his joy
But remembering a happy moment in time.
Along they sputtered and fluttered on an imaginary path
Winding trails of meadows
Deserts deep with ocean spray
Are you alive, they inquired unto themselves?
"Ay, I am. Or I was? " Answered â€˜no one'.
For through the flying twirls of time,
Itself the moments stopped.
When they stop
And only when they stop
They see the colors in between
But spinning, dancing, whirlwinds
Make the two a lovely scene.
Blues, reds and violets
Browns and earth tones
Creating the most slightly cyclone
Evervescence, glitter, particles, dust
Ere they meet
Moth and Butterfly
Time and space
Grass and green
Blue and sky
Moon and silver
Opposing beauties,
Wandering the wilderness
In perfect, awkward harmony.
On they go, ad infinitum.
Said a caterpillar to ant
Look at sky, see them fly!
