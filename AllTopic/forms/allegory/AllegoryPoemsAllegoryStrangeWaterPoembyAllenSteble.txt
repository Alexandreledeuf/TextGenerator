Strange water flows freely
Right through towns centre
Nobody suspects anything
So we drink it to excess
It flows from the wide mouth
Of the high lofty hills above
Straight onto our eager tongues
But we don't dare question it
For its source seems pure
Like the artist's untainted painting
It caresses our ego with seductive allure
Like it's some sort of cure
For our perceived inadequacies
And the reality of our insanity
Is that it's all an illusion
Just a simulated humanity
To feed a system of corruption
Perhaps One doomed to destruction
Many are blinded by this water
This strange, delicious water
Because it tastes so sweet
But numbs us from head to feet
This strange marvellous water
Is keeping our minds trapped
From seeing the real truth
...That we are without limits!
