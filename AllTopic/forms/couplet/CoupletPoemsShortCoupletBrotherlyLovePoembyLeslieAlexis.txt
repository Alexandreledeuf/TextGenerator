In eyes as clear as glass I see
That wisdom of love is for me
To hold in time and cherish much
Lovely emotions: hugs, and such.
The simple things like honey bees
Know best to heed brother’s pleas
When unfortunate is the fate,
The many join and share the plate.
Through sweet, or sour, they are there
To share with brother, for they care.
Man can learn a lot from the beast,
To cherish brother is the least
That one human can humbly do,
For him to know love that is true.
