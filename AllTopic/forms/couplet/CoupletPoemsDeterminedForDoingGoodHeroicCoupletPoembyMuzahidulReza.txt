Determined For Doing Good - Heroic Couplet
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Not to do it you deter my mind
But to do it I am determined,
As I am aged enough to understand
What is right and what is wrong,
I know my body and soul well
So I am doing for both the poles.
