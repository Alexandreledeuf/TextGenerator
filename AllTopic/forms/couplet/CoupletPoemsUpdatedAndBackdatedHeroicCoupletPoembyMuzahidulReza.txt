(Updated And Backdated: Heroic Couplet)
Our homes are in the global village
Where each country is a small cottage
We all live now together
Sharing opinion, running business
Each other and one another
Like friend, sister and brother;
So, how can you resist us?
To enter the homes of others
Which originates a serious chaos
But your weak brain fails to realize,
What can you be called?
O, yes! "Backdated, fully backdated."
