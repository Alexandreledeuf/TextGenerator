Heroic Couplet For Life And Death Are The Two Aspects
February 3, 2020
Life after its birth walks onto the earth
After walking death takes it into grave,
Life and death really what a climax!
This term often makes one what a perplex!
I said to you in earth in very short,
You say to others here in proper length.
