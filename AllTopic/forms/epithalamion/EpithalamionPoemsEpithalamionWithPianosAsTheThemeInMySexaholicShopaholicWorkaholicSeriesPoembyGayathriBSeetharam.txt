ii)Epithalamion by Edmund Spenser
My marriage to my beloved husband was celebrated on Jan 27th,1992
And I was blessed by Aphrodite/Venus, Goddess of Love
And Hera/Juno, Queen of Gods sought to be at my wedding with her husband
For true love was being enshrined in both our hearts
And I, following my bride groom's lead, took the seven steps around the Holy Pyre
And both of us swore to be true to each other
The cuckoo sang melodiously in tune to our heart beats
The musicians played their instruments with zeal
And the priest dictated our exchange of Hindu vows
Said in complicated Sanskrit from the Vedas, the Ancient Hindu Book of Rituals and Customs
We were blessed by our family and friends
And joyous cries of good wishes rang true on that day
And truly, despite ups and downs,
Love, laughter and life has metaphorized into daily events
And if the cuckoo bird sings beautifully
Along with the robin which hops around
When not flying or perching on our garden tree
It is to make the music in all our lives (my 19 year old son is with us now)
Heard and felt by all around us in our circle and vicinity;
To celebrate our romantic love as a Sexaholic
I have Live Streamed a love song composed by me
And set to David Brubeck's piano play
And this is on my You tube web page;
As a Shopaholic, I had picked up a miniature piano in Yorkville
That sat well in our living room for a long time
And symbolised the musical tune in our lives
When my son was growing up;
As a Workaholic, I have painted a grand piano
With a Book of Music strategically positioned
For us to write in and until now,
It has been a fugue for the three of us.
