On a sultry day, walking on the roadside,
Someone gently tapped on my backside.
Turned, saw my best friend, with a broad smile.
Oh, where had you been all this while?
Well, honest, went on a self imposed exile.
She replied wide eyed, without guile.
Life was getting to me, so to save my identity
Took a short break, I not like whine and self pity.
For in city, only time hear a giggle or a tinkle,
Wrinkles soften and eyes light up and crinkle
Is when folks hold the stem of goblet to make a toast
Over sparkling champagne and chicken roast.
No children in the park sing or dance
Hop, skip, jump, roar, shriek and prance.
On my way here, saw some old and young
At dawn, laugh in the park, with arms flung.
There are laughter clubs, age old cure
For all the stress in morning air pure.
Well, well, well, I am so very glad to hear.
Guess, chose the right time to reappear.
She took a long breath and said, must admit
Was losing my sense of humour, bit by bit.
Would you believe, had written my own epitaph:
'Here lies one, who sought to make the world laugh.'
