LAST EPISTLE
Colored as rainbow with full bright,
Copiously filled that perpetual heart,
Highly valued although so light,
Alluring heart of gleaming dearth,
Her most decorated among those hundreds.
Compared to gold, nothing less better,
The waiting truth of her inner thoughts,
Fully painted that sheath of letter;
Till the date, my errand had never brought.
No words to wish, I wish him booming life.
Wonder as warrior and cheerful as lark,
Visit through like swiftly flowing stream.
Brightest traveled to dim, then to dark
From most trusted, that I never dreamt.
Why to wander with that mourning heart,
Until, never discovered that her corner's loathe,
Her journey to the other side…
God knew my life's first hiccup to breath,
Leaving my eroded heart beside,
I to laugh with my emotional solace;
Treasuring her last epistle before god's decision,
Though this memory shall dismay me all,
That my loving heart for expression,
But to win again, I never shall.
As I wait, the rays shall shine,
Like the brightest flower of June,
So shall she dance in my tune…
