The unknown author of the ‚Epistle of Prayer‘ says:
„Whoso draweth near to God as it is
by such a reverent  affection touched
before, he is one spirit with God.
That is, though all that God and he be two
and sere in kind, nevertheless yet in grace
they are so knit together that they are but one in spirit;
And all this is one for onehead of love
and accordance of will; and in the onehead is marriage
made between God and the soul the which shall never be broken…." (The Epistle of Prayer, in Pepwell's edition of „The Cell of Self knowledge", edited by Edmund Gardner, P.88) .
