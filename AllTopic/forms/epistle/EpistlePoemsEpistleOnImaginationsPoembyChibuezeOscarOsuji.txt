OUR IMAGINATIONS
Our stable brains playing the treach'ry
Stewards vistas to unknown imag'ry
Steady yourself while we travel down thought
Seeking imaginations we long sought
What if we could scroll over to the past
Errors we shall erase from our mast
Pretend wishes were horses, and we rode
them, to positive side of life's anode
Collecting virtue from wisdom's pocket
Men were wise enough to kick no bucket
Pretend the nights were kind and free from harm
None holding a hidden knife on his arm
Even the days, hatch'd to be good tidings
Spreading the solarize for the green beings
Who utilize the light with chlorophyll
From them all livings find their daily meal
Pretend the world was without an illness
Bat'rias and virus's were felt with goodness
Pretend the world was free from all adverse
And love glide the air of the universe
Everyman a neighbour to another
Like angels watching over each other
Pretend meekness was found in our sons
None molest our daughters with weapons
Pretend we could hold our hands again
To remorse about all the people we've slain
Pretend our hearts were all geocentric
Good things revolv'd round us, so eclectric
Happiness, understanding and laughter
A new world, of happy ever after
Pretend these imaginations were true
What a wonder we'd create just me and you!
