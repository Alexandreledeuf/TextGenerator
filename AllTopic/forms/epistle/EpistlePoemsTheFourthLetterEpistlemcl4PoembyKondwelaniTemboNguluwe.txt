Dear Sin,
It's a new day
...
Past two thousand fifteen
Another step I take
-
Into two thousand sixteen
It's a New year
-
And you were the very first thing that came my way...
I invited you on my journey
Of another 365+ quarter days
With long kisses to the quays
Holding to you night and day
Like a work-suit stuck with muddy clay
I still held on to you and stayed
Stuck on you, all day;
It's a new day...
Oh! Stuck on you
With this feeling down deep in my soul
That I just can't lose -
To you -
It's a new day;
Guess am on my way...
I needed a friend
Though times past it seemed like I'd be with you
Till the end; of the world
It's a new day;
Guess am on my way, home
And you tell me
Just be glad you stayed
Scoffers and mockers maybe
Me no way
Only for a few seconds will I be glad I stayed
Only for a few, nudity-ignited seconds will I be glad I stayed
Like fireworks
The fire burns for lustful desire
Then spreads and fades away -
It's a new day...
Just 3 days
Away to this year
I told myself with you I'll no longer stay
But here I am again
Allowing us, you and I, to stay
The same way
Still unsure if I will say
The truth and keep at bay
Maybe even see the end of today
It's a new day...
As I await tomorrow to come my way
And the words that you will say -
Jehovah God show me the way
It's a new day...
YOURS LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT
Smiley.
