Dear revered reader,
From my heart these gently trigger.
Let them who cry in pain
Remember the sun and rain.
Let those who prosper in expedience
Not await God's providence.
Let the speaker speak in truth
And resist his tongue from brute.
Let the teacher teach in fairness
For his children shall see kindness.
Let the leader loose his bossy tie
And show us the ladder to the sky.
And let the follower humble his brow
For the eggs shall one day crow.
Let the judge be just
And reject the backhander's cost.
Let the friend be a good comrade
And offer no deceit of any grade.
Let the rich fend for the needy,
There is no gift for the greedy.
Let everyone then be a good fellow,
As our deeds follow us like shadow.
