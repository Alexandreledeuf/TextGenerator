An epistle
Sculpted by the fickle palms of fatum
As a tissue levitates
From her shrouded bassinet - the cardboard box
On a lonely bar
In the middle of Hanoi
As a wild yellow hibiscus
Flaunting an imperial topaz tone
Of her glistening abode - her beguiling bamboo skin
Embellishes an invitation
With the infective rouge of her lips
A note stamped in scarlet red
An invitation to evacuate a lonely man's wallet
Of his protracted desire
