O Mine mater, faithful virg'n! ,
Unto her, The glories b'given;
Hath she b'sought upon her Man,
Thou found, In eyes of wealthy nation;
B'hold, On route of death, she travell'd
Fought mi'htier wars, thus conquer'd;
Brou'ht me home, laid me to her bed,
Caress'd gently, Mine babyish head;
Wrapp'd, In the warmness of her compass,
Though in her hard days lay my genesis;
Fortune futures, canst foretell her gloomy
nights,
Whence sleeps I, with playin' abacus;
Saggin', down honey of her breast in my
mouth,
Meekly, I look up, the sympathy burn'th
Through her eye, her breath;
O fool me! , I hath to say thank thee amah! ;
If I am ill, She'd fed on her tear
Her griefs art meanin'less to her,
On that Africa downpour in september;
Whence every children cri'd for shelter,
On streets, the hide 0'seek, jumps in
loam;
The howlin' and hellish Scream,
Suffocates, The dreadful play of rim;
As pup, I chill'd in her blossom,
She'd be mine coat, mine jackets;
On her Knees She prays;
O thou callous rain, she quoths!
Watchin' through the garment of clouds,
That halos mine eyeballs;
Those lullaby wilt slain me to kips,
Thine carings art Incompar'd to angels;
Nor canst give of the lazy moons,
Thine wrought more, worthy;
Or forty bags of shekel can pay__
Today a chap, Thou hast grown me wholly;
Thine old affection, I feel, times I lay lonely
O mater Durst stay afar me,
Come back, O mater, Come nigh, come!
Thou virtuous creature!
Dampness of thine arms, Lay Me;
Blest, stand'th thee, thine names,
'mongst thousands;
Thou worth, a gard'n of lilies
A basketfull of rare jew'ls,
A corronett molten'd of glazin' stars,
A kingdom built of chapit'rs
Bravo! , Thou hast buy me prides,
'Mongst kindred of kings,
Whom, Thath dwelt on earth,0'sky above;
Canst steal her heart from me?
Dope me, So her, I disclaim or
forsake....?
......Far it be!
On royal chariot, If I ride, 'round the world
Fear not, I shalt brace mine steed,
T' Submit homages, 's epistle 0' lowly bid;
Hither, standeth thine backyard almond,
Thine integrity, wilt I uplift,
Pledge, To forsake not;
Thine far-fetched didactics to strampet
Fear not, Ev'r Thine cleavage wilt b'mine cot;
Fear not, Hark, At thine ear, Mine
whisperin'
Thine cherished son hath return,
Mater! , Am back home with fain;
Give to me thine kiss of life 'gain.
Dedicated to My Lovely Mother
