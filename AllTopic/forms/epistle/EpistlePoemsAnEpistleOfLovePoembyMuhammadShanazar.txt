When you had been with me,
Waterfalls sprouted,
From the frozen mountains,
And they spread in the valleys,
On the dormant grasslands,
The stubborn winds sprawled
Their feet on the velvety carpet of dew
And amphitheater of passions
Was wrapped in the concert of fragrances.
Since you have gone apart,
Thousands of waterfalls, all of sudden
Have begun to flow through veins
Of speckled body: Thirsty wilderness.
Since you have gone to the alien land,
All cascades have contracted
To the rocky mountain of my mind,
And winds faraway in the sky
Have been embellishing your name,
All of sudden there have scattered
Abruptly thousands of roses,
On the faded sheet of passions.
Anonymous rustling sounds clinging
On the curtains of my silent room,
Question me about the past conversation
With the crickets and cadence
Of some acquainted voice
Which has faded away amid the chinks
Of shut windows touching, plying
With scattered neem-fruit in the yard,
Then there remains behind nothing,
Even to the farthest endâ€¦ nothing
The moon has lost itself
In the moisty islands of eyes, where haunting
Strands of Hamant remains echoing,
And in the half opened windows.
When did the sun show up,
Upon the tiny drops of sweat?
I know not.
