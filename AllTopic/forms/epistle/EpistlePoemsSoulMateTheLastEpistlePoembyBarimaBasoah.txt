Everyone here is looking for someone,
I am also here looking for someone,
many are looking but with their eyes,
they cannot see and they cannot find.
Body cries for help,
heart bleeds for love,
spirit craves for fire,
soul searches for mate.
On the highways and byways of life,
as we journey all lifelong,
to the endless home of the heart,
a parallel line shall meet somewhere, someday.
