(In honor of Black History Month)
Atticus, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, hero?
Gentle, understanding, just, and
Loving.  Brave? Would he say, 'No? ' I think he would.
Atticus, soaring!
One shot amo, love, patience, humor.
Black men called him friend.  White men called him scum.
Atticus, the fearless; wry, wise, splendid.
Rainbow in shadows.
