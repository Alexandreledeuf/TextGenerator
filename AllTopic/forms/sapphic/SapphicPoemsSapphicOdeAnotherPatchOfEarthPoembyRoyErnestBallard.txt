Sapphic Ode, Another Patch of Earth
An acre in a conquered land,
once I was Caesar's then a king's
for some things go from hand to hand
like precious rings.
Sometimes with lent or stolen gold
men came to claim me, stone by stone,
‘From this day forward', I was told,
‘You're mine alone.'
From time to time a robin thought
by fighting fiercer than the rest
that I was his and dearly bought:
his own sweet nest.
Throughout all this Dame Fortune knew
but never gave the game away
that I am hers and it proved true
for she does stay.
