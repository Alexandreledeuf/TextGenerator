Your voice is like music to my ears
your whisper is like the soften breeze
you may wander daily anywhere, but never freeze
I remain still healthy even though you'll sneeze
I don´t get caught a cold easily
since you oft support me with bumble-bee honey
I am now amidst thousandfold cold
I never get sick even though´m so old
as years pass by many milliard miles
pay attention to nature around thee
the surrounds turn old very old whilst
thou and I not, due to consuming
thy own body bumble-bee bunny
thou support me as much as thou canst
I have glee such as our beloved mums
both have pleasure on heaven´s spot
thou playeth and study whilst I pray to God
then I will travel again in search of new cod
and bread to feed our mind and soul
based upon ora et labora our beings`whole
thou art mine and I am thine
remember thou sayth whilst we playeth
con amore forever more
thou in mine and I´m in thine
in our own surrounds, I feel fine
thou art God´s child so mild
thou stays calm on rivers wild
I pray everyday myriad ways
Oh Lord, keep mine heart pure
your voice is like music to my ears
your whisper is like the tender breeze
imagine why I never freeze
you refreshened the day before it seized
you feed me with strawberry love sweet
honeybee and bumble-bee bunny
but despite so many
you empower me with your cutest showers
darling baby bumble-bee of me
Ora et Labora means: Pray and Work
Con Amore means: With Love
