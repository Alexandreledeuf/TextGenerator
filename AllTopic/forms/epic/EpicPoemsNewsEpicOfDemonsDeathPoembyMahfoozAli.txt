To hear some news,
the village men gathered close around.
The town crier began and no one made the slightest sound.
'The dead men's bones where found bleaching,
beneath the noonday sun,
the stinging gnats and black flies,
swarming over every blessed one.
Black carrion birds
enjoyed a dreadful feast,
I would say
and the marauding killer beastie has gotten clean away.'
