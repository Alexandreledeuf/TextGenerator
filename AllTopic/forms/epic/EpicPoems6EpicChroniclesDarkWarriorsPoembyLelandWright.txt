We are soldiers that work for the devil
Kill so many innocence I deserve a metal
I am the strongest in the archive, an artifact
When I was created I gave my owner a heart attack
I slaughter my enemies with my sword but also with facts
I told them it is only a matter of time before you’ll be tapped
With the devils speech and you all be strapped
With uzi’s to kill your owns sons
While my master watches with fun
I’m looking at the tons without one
More to convert, needs to be more with guns
Not my fault I think this way, innocence always run
I was born a dark warrior, red skin murderer
I am not use to seeing the sun, but I love the moonlight
Shining my darkness, in the midst of my farness
I sit on a kite and incinerate the light to harness night
Then tattoo your face with ten tears
It signifies the ten years you’ll be here
Trust me you don’t know the meaning of fear
I told all the prophets, I am not mad because of my psychology
I was just born with this methodology and told them to forget there astrology
They’re not prophets or messiahs; I will smack them with tires and call them liars
Attach pliers on there sex organs, treat them harshly because they’re future is cemented
So many souls may not be mentioned, but just seeing me will leave their souls demented
In the end were all brothers despite what we believe in, in the end we all have sins
But since most not aware of this I still exist to bring fear from the head, toe, to the wrist
Giving you hateful images to your brain, demonic scriptures through your veins
