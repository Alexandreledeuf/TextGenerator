Drops of water help a seed to germinate
Thus, liberating a life from where it hibernates.
The same water when unleashed by deluge
Uproots grown-up trees in violent rampage.
Even a cloud burst never discriminates
Between flora and fauna when it terminates
Motley lives in the massacre of its victims
At a single stroke, no one can even dream.
The disastrous deluge caused by a cloud burst
At Leh recently had shaken human trust
In kindness of the almighty and His motive
Behind such instances that are too destructive.
Some wonders you do play even in tragedies
By survival of an infant buries under debris
For hours together amid corpses of parents
Till a kind soul among dead a life invents.
Same can be fate of a mountain rail line
Laid by human beings in the intricate terrain.
An achievement of expertise, imagery n vision,
Vanishing abruptly by stroke of land slide n rain.
