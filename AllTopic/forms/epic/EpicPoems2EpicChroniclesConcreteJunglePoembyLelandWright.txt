In the concrete jungle, where drugs slang to maintain the bloody crane
Their lives always been this way, always looking over their shoulder
The dried tears washed away with blood from the most potent culture
The concrete jungle feeds off blood, the people are use to seeing torture
That’s why our bodies flood in the mud that’s been their lives
The ammo their gun holds, their caliber
Seems more important to them than learning their algebra
It’s all about street smarts, survival, and loyalty from their live crew
When the wind blew what unravel was no one that were fake
Real people live life on the corner, surrounding them is killers at their wake
The reader from afar opens a book of a tragedy, the truth in the streets
As he opens the book, he could hear his heart beat rumbling like clapping feet
As he opens the book, he reads the untold scripture, nightmares he will soon greet
L-Dub was his name, he lived on the streets, and he was deep in the crack game
All it gave him was lack of mental power and emotional pain
But he had peers alongside him; he didn’t know such thing as fear
They hosted a block party alongside him, only a few cars could enter
Music was loud and it was crowded, barbecue was fed drugs at the rear
Lastly gambling in the back of the shack where L-Dub rest at
In the back, Frank was mad he was losing his bank in the card game
He felt like a lame drinking all night, was no closer to fame
Enraged he left tumble on his self got the gun and starting slinging
Most people had a gun at the party and started reaching
The killer let off most people jet off in sight of bullet fire
Police were waiting nearby for something to set off
L-Dub duck and slid hoping he wouldn’t get spotted
Jake his best friend was shot his body quickly rotted
The shooter tried to dip in the bushes while he was fatigued
L-Dub had a desert eagle on standby; when he drew it he let the bullets leave the barrel
Frank fell to his knee’s the drunken spree was over
But L-Dub wouldn’t let his friend death go though
He killed Frank; his friends picked him up before cops came
Frank died of internal bleeding; L-Dub never got a chance to flee
He died two weeks later…he couldn’t even read… he was only fifteen
