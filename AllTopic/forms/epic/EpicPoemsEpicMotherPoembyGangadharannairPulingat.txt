Kunti the great mother of Pandavas
The princes of Hastinapura
The great characters of Mahabharata
The great mother Kunti and her woes
Her tears for her beloved sons
Her dedication for her beloved ones
Her sadness and sympathy hid in mind
Of Karna the son whom she abandoned
Mother Kunti the great epic mother.
