The omnipresence of ocean felt at Ganapatipule
The aggression of tides on shore for confluence
Of the sea ordained by the Almighty with the soil
Imprints on our soul, oh Lord, a sublime inluence.
The grayish silky sand with minute graguels
Spread on the beach on too thick layers
Housing prawns, crabs n what not in their holes
Shining in sunlight as an expanse of silver.
Lifelong penance of palms on the slopes
Alongwith the mangotrees guarding the beach
Are also spectators and they set-up the pitch
For galloping tides, in pledging to elope.
Chirping of the birds sets in the dawn
Melody of nightingale reminds night bygone.
The mist shields for a while the vast expanse
Of sea water which may be longing in a trance.
Enticing however is roaring of the surfs
And the glittering tides in rays of infant Sun.
Celestial is the melody produced by the collusion
With rocky shores by thundering surfs.
