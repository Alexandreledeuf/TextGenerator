One day I'd like to write an epic poem.
That could mirror the fragility of life
It would be as light as a butterfly's wing
And as sublime as a crimson sunset:
Radiating with the beauty of the Word,
And capturing all the sorrows of the world.
It would be as clear as purest crystal
Yet as elliptical as a distant star.
It would face the monstrous, raging darkness
With matador like skill and elegance.
Its great power would lie in its gentleness
And its sense of grace as soft as snow flakes.
In time it might slowly expand consciousness.
And I hope it would make the angels weep!
