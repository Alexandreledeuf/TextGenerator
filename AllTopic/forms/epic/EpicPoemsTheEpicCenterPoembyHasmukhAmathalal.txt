The epic center
Real inventor
Off all evils
Appreciated still
Not that it is useless
Brings all shine on the face
Involves in mad race
Yet terms it as valiant chase
Yet that spins
Gradually wins
Comes over
Finds shelter
Head to lead
With no lead
Thoughts are dead
But readers are well read
Not lying idle
Think endless little
Yet mother of all battles
Comes to term and settle
Aches when find no exit
Looses patience and crumbles the feet
Yet shows mettle and real nerve
Ready to face challenge and serve
Oh! No. it has aimless venture
Think of Dead Sea and volatile future
What to do and what not to do!
Head turns it as absolutely true
