Bloood relations too are estranged by the greed
To disintigration of a family it gives more speed.
For wealth it may be or for landed property
It breaks bonds of a family living in harmony.
Pretty women too had been often the reason
Bone of contention between learned men,
Propelling them for war and confrontation
For nothing else, other than her possession.
Ramayana n Mahabharta, the great Hindu epics
On genesis of great wars both were specific.
Great wars they say were fought for honor,
Of equally great women, between great warriors.
Scholar par excellence was Ravan king of Srilanka
Dearest devotee too he was of Lord Shiva.
He too was a victim of inherent six enemies,
By abducting Vaidehi, he charted own destiny.
Throne of Hastinapur kingdom n lust for power
His lust for Dropadi and anger against her
Had driven Duryodhana to wage the great war
Against the Pandavas, his own cousin brothers.
Acute hatred and anger had driven Adolf Hitler
To go for annihilation of a race called Jews.
Such brutal precedents history has very few.
Its aftermath caused British empires shatter.
