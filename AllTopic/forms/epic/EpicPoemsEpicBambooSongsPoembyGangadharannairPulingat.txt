The cowherds listens the song
The cows straightens the ears
As if entertaining themselves
Their happiness visible in eyes
The herdsmen pride of the singer
Krishna the embodiment of devotion
The songs from the bamboo equipment
How wonderful the song feels still
Songs have mystical powers
Songs have entertaining powers
Songs related to epic poems a pride
The great traditional songs were
The talent shown by the herding men
Their leisure time they made equipment
From the nature they took the material
Made holes their own and tried to sing
The air in specific rhythmical styles
Rhythmically the songs created
Nature and men ever co related
The songs are a part of nature itself.
