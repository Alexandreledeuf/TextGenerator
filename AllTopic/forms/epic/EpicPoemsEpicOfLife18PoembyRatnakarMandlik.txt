In spite of achievements no. one to him eluded
Being monopoly of the Creator and not of the created.
Intense was his striving for that coveted position,
For more research gave him further inspiration.
Wealth he treasured material and spiritual
Incomplete yet was though his sole ambition.
He wanted to creat life in ways artificial
To be victorious in his unique competition.
Gigantic will power and sustained hard work
Enables him to produce life in laboratory,
With process artificial but natural ingredients.
His march it endorsed towards that position.
