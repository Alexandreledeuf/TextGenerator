The soldier lies motionless in the desert.
He assesses his life, coming to the harsh
realization that he has failed miserably
to live up to the expectations set upon him.
His American Dream to outshine his peers
has been reduced to but a dream in which
he dies quickly...so his peers won’t know
of the shame that besets his wretched soul.
He used to stand tall, face up to adversity,
and emerge victorious every single time.
But you wouldn’t be able to tell nowadays.
Too bad...he could have been somebody!
