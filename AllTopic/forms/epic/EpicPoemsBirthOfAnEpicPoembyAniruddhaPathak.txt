O lowly hunter,
No glory shall thou ever grace
Thee for endless years, still later,
To have slain merciless
A pair of swans in love embrace.

Sage Valmiki was so moved when he saw a hunter's arrow killing a pair of swans lost in love embrace that a shloka (verse) came up to his tongue as above. Enraged, he cursed the hunter. And this inspired him to write the epic Ramayana. He is considered as ādi kavi, the first or the oldest known poet. Ramayana happened even before Mahabharata.
