Chase of money, wealth and money power
Lands human being in grief and despair.
The greed for the duo is quite insatiable
To achieve contentment, he can not be able.
Chase of ultimate power too is quite dangerous
The journey for the same is too much perilous.
Near absolute power, may it be money or muscle
Creates optimum enemies ready to him jostle.
Extreme of anything is often disastrous,
The best possible policy suggested Confucious
For mortal beings to adopt path golden middle,
Best it is to eat sugar being an ant little.
Money and also muscle are nodoubt necessary
For every one living to over-come his worries.
Money as also muscle as well as good health
Are means of living n can not be end ultimate.
