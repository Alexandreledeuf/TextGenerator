You are an Epic
that continually unfolds within me.
I have opened you
to the center of your story.
I do not know the beginning,
nor do I know how your story will end.
You are a complex character.
You have many facets.
You are beautiful and talented,
the calm beauty of a shimmering lake
fed by deep underground springs.
You walk with a cool elegance,
demure and softly attractive
with just the right amount of class.
You play the heroine lead.
You break many hearts.
My character must ad-lib.
No one has handed me a script.
I am blue collar
with an artistic, sensitive side,
still not completely tamed.
My qualities are romantic and poetic.
My edges still quite raw and jagged,
my steel not completely polished.
I tempt circumstance.
I play the spoiler.
