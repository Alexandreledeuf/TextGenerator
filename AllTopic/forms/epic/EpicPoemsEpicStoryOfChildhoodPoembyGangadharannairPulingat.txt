Effulgence of childhood stories
The great stories in Indian epics
Stories of childhood of Sree Krishna
The most enlightened one ever interesting
In the life of a cowherd and friends
As beloved son in an effluent family
The great loving mother and her punishment
As life of god incarnated and blessing
Sree Krishna childhood stories ever supreme.
