Lean, fast
lonely greyhounds,
you are ghosts
of the past
“deserts are interesting
spiritual places”
a sad joke
on the margin
of history,
honor is meaningless
cold winds,
long winters,
infinite wheat,
the light of the plains
pushed far
no room for saints
or soldiers
no room for poets
history passed by
and silence remains
the epic is dead
eternity to rot
