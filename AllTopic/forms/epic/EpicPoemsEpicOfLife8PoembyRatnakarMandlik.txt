Politics is statesmanship, so they believe
Though in reality to humanity they consume.
There is no dearth of frogs in todays politics
Who harass people with nonsense gimmicks.
Where ate patriots, ready to die for motherland
To martyr themselves to preserve their pride?
In their lieu have come-up columns of goons
Who can no doubt be dear children of Satan.
Intellectuals responsible for giving direction
Have become indifferent to blues of the nation,
To injustices n cruelties n their perpretation
On hapless, unfortunate majority of brethren.
Intellectuals display high qualiy moral courage
They are broken, however, by physical harms usage
By the second raters as also their muscle power
They are mum, though, grieved as silent spectators.
Unbelievably wide is chasm in haves and havenots.
Wealth flows uninterrupted in service of fortunate.
Poor strive even for morsels of food to be alive.
Thy face endless pain n many reasons to grieve.
Coexistence of ugliness with the beauty
Romance of affluence with acute scarcity.
While joy governs a life till the eternity
It's brethren go on suffering only in vanity.
