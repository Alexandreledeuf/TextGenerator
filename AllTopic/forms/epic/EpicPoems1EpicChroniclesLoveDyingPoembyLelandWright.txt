Blood swarming a cold heart
Love far deeper than Starsky & Hutch
My love shall never bleed through the pavement or rust
For it is far deeper than the feeling when we touch
My love is as strong as a thunder god
As well as the anti-god
They always clashing for it all…my soul
My love resides on the other side of the picket fence
My heart currently relies on the hate my love one commenced
I am on the side where hate lies
A place where even a soldier cries
This story takes place where hearts descend when they fly
Story will be dark unbelievable and might be gory
There won’t be a hidden message of triumph or glory
Only how my love turned to hate
And how my hate came to know me
I came home early from work
Called every time a female co worker flirted
She winked at me she wanted lovely lust
But I rather think about my wife
Salvaging and protecting my love is a must
Came to the door knocked three times
Made a beautiful poem tried my best to rhyme
My friends make fun saying I worship my wife love
Is loving your wife with a passion a crime?
I guess so the door opened when the wind flow hit it
Smelled a scent known to man as bodies penetrating ripping it
Slid upstairs bedroom room door was slightly open shocked what I saw
My wife sexing up a man jesus juice flying betraying my love so raw
Wanted to scream but my lungs were swollen
Wanted to cry but my eyes got numb that they began to burn
Far worse than watching bills pile or money folding
Wanted to burn her and place her in an urn
But couldn’t my love didn’t know how to turn
My love is firm but felt like I was in a drama movie in a fiasco
How was I suppose to react though I came in and shoved the man
Got into an altercation wanted his entire face to plummet from the earth
And wish I could shove the man back inside his mothers womb back to birth
After finishing off a foe I never knew I look at my wife eying her down like a hawk
My fist was now as powerful as a rock my love disappeared and all I saw was a mop
Walked out not saying a word heard her berate me
Didn’t faze me, because she didn’t make me or raised me I was a man she was a girl
All I can do is get the divorce papers signed and sob
Lay in my house love dying and hatred all into a twirl, I was truly robbed
