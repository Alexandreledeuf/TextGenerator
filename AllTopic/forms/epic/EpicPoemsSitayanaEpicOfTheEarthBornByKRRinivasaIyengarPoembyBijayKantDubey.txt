Sitayana places Iyengar
As a Ramayana scholar
Writing the saga of Janaki,
King Janak's daughter
And telling in his own way
Adding to the story and version
Of Valmiki.
A poem of some epic length
It tells the story of Sita,
The earth-born
Which appeared before
From the depths of earth
On a lotus flower
While King Janak was tilting the land
With a golden furrow.
Sitayana is the flower
Of his study of the Ramayana
And his brooding over it
Attaching a special significance
To the origin and birth
And trouble and tribulation of Sita
And her forbearance.
