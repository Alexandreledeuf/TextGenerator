Death be dead no matter what! !
Wind be still no matter what,
For the epic of my love still hangs in the air;
Walking around in search of my lover.
Amicably noted are my works of peace and love! !
Nature and life,
Dutifully attached by the wind;
With the maticulous attention of my love to share with you,
Looking for her along the narrow path.
Life and love,
The shadow of things with the muse of my sweet mind!
Death be dead no matter what;
To entertain my mind with the works of the truth,
And, let the wind be still as well.
