Mercy is not a part of me, soul is burned, but that’s not how deep it gets
A killer in every sense of the word, maybe even a serial killer, I guess the shoes fit
I have left bodies drenched in blood, leaving you bleeding with your ancestors
Your family would never be at peace, like souls, victims of child molesters
In my mind, I fall eternally into the dark space where I dance with the devil
I am no angel who heals wounds by any means or with alcohol
Rather drain your body in bathroom stalls, I am sick not mentality there
Mentally ill I am not looking for remorse, just wish I had a life that was fair
Wish my life ended, or I was burned literally with a torch
But here on forth, I cleanse my dirty hands, wiped off the dry blood
Too late, picked up by police and I sung like a bird
Came to find I was only picked up because of a lot of bad tickets
The cameras of the media took lovely flicks of me getting handed life
Now I lay in this shallow bed, with killers like me and rapist reside
Couldn’t take it inside, I slit my own atom apple out
World saved from this demon…I deserved it
Don’t kill, especially if you don’t have the nerves for it
