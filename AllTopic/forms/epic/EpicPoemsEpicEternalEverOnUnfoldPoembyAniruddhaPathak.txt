A great piece of verse seems this universe,
Lyrics emanating from quantum soup,
Each of whose word vibrates as it quivers,
Inter-linked, its lines make eternal loop.
Has a unique metre but blank of rhyme,
It's too subtle in human ken to sink,
The warps and woofs are made of space and time,
And every line's writ with vanishing ink.
An epic of immense proportions,
Its quaint imagery yon of man's reach,
Leaving one speechless its figure of speech,
And deeper delves its meaning than oceans.
In constant change, ever evolving mould,
An epic â€˜tis forever on unfold.
