Big bang!
In void's lab did happen
Such an awful explosion;
So is it fixed in human.
Time!
Had her course so cryptic
Through caverns pure and static,
Though often seems pragmatic.
Man!
Angels boasted, of purity
Jinns too, of versatility,
But liked not man's divinity.
Prophets!
Having lost the seat blessed,
Adam in repentance traversed,
Others, in turns, all sauntered.
Nature!
Since origin is she chaste,
Still stand even the outcast,
But, adore not any holocaust!
Futurity!
Of Greed and feud shall all wander,
Intruding other's boarder,
Will find life and death harder.
The Supreme Being so Benign,
Of compassion do all align.
