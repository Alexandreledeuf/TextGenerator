The lines below are taken from Sri Aurobindo's epic poem Savitri- book I Canto Four- The Secret Knowledge. Line 2-17
Sri Aurobindo was a nineteenth century poet, philosopher, mystic yogi, freedom fighter and visionary from India. August 15th is his birthday as well as Independence Day of India.
I am posting them here for their poetic beauty and the hope and aspirations that these lines provide to the future of humanity. A title is given by me only for the sake of title.
Savita Tyagi
" Our early approaches to the Infinite
Are sunrise splendors on a marvelous verge
While lingers yet unseen the glorious sun.
What now we see is a shadow of what must come.
The earth's up-look to a remote Unknown
Is a preface only of the epic climb
Of human soul from its flat earthly state
To the discovery of a greater self
And the far gleam of an eternal Light.
This world is a Beginning and a base
Where Life and Mind erect their structured dreams;
An unborn Power must build reality.
A death-bound littleness is not all we are;
Immortal our forgotten vastness
Awaits discovery in our summit selves;
Unmeasured breadths and depths of being are ours.
Sri Aurobindo
