Epic
Poor man's car
Broken; window down
- - - - -
Sparrow lost her way
Shelter-less
- - - - -
It is morning
Bewildered man and bird
One wants out
One wants in
- - - -
Inside car war-front
Both hearts beat
- - - -
"I love you, want you free."
Murmurs Man.
- - - -
Misunderstood
Bird fights back.
The wings flap
Windshield; back
Things fly inside car
A desert's hurricane
- - - - -
Some stealth
Maybe drone
Like killer of Afghans
Taliban, Pakistan
In no time and sudden
The bird falls to its death
- - - - -
"I am not a G.I."
Says the man and cries.
"Your death is my sorrow
Today's wrong is pain for tomorrow."
The man says
Steps out; holds the bird.
- - - - -
No breath, no movement.
Bird takes off in sudden as do husks
Lies, tricks, camouflage; survival
UFO never gives a signal...
