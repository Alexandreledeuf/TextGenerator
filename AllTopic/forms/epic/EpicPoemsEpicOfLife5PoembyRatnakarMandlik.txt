Fighting against the onslaught of roaring tides
In chest deep water struggling for balance
Throws in sea water a fisherman his net
In high tide to earn livelihood in twilight.
Oblivious of everything in the dim light
A couple on the beach enjoyed the moment.
Entwined they were though not physically
Through eyes they enjoyed the mirth of unity.
Frightening was milieu on descent of night
There was utter darkness and no trace of light
For hours together till there twinkled a light
Perhaps from an approaching fisherman's boat.
Calm and stillness reigned on the region
Except for the melody produced by the waves.
Anything can be engulfed in that darkest cave
An illusion for the night by great magician.
Lord Ganesha-Lambodhar emperor of universe
Residing in the temple, imposing n picturesque
He commands the ocean as also the universe
The lord controls from there functions diverse.
