Hatred - Killa Jack
Worse than a demon, I am a bi-polar animal
Live with mammals that happen to be cannibals
Hope my enemy dies slowly in pain, oh so easily
As long as he perish is what freedom means to me
I look at the movies and see the different scenery
Glisten in the dark like a marksman, in essence with evil things
Stuff you in my van; stab you into your blood gleams
I’m here to wreck havoc; my mom even knew I was a savage
Just want you to bleed let it ooze, I won’t forget to clean the clues
I’m was born to die and live to commit crime, wonder who will tarnish the fastest
The devil is here not even God saw the signs, killing people amounts to glory I bask in
I was born to kill a dream and a destiny I fulfilled, I can’t escape it I love how it feels
My brain is shivering so I can’t hold still, not sorry about selling crack it’s my only skill
Love – Anthony
I do the things I do because I must put food on the table
I sold so much I afforded to feed my family and my stable
A team of drug dealers, no squealers, I don’t mean to do this forever
But it’s hard to change your bird’s color if you’re use to the feather
Always use to be a dark cloud over me, wife & I changed the weather
Together but I don’t plan to tell her about my illegal activities
But I do plan to retire; I plan to do it so I can keep my sanity
I don’t have the stomach to order people to die, bags in my eyes
From unrest not getting a chance to see the Lord’s sunset
Jack still trying to kill me to take over the drug game
He can have it; I already took my stab at it I just want my name
And the cash I claimed and retire quietly, move aside silently
Maybe I can fulfill my dreams through my unborn child privately
Dad let my mom get high off heroin, a devils pin, wish she had metal skin
She overdosed and my dad abandoned me, I carved her name on my skin
She’ll live through me and when I die we will join together for an eternity
But that’s enough looking at the past, No longer have to live with a inside gash
Now In God we trust, able to shake off the devils lust, even her demonic touch
My child won’t have to see through my eyeglass, he will receive God’s task
