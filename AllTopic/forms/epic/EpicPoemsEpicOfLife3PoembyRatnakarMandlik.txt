Scattered on an elevation are the Konkani huts
Adjoining the beach in an elegane resort,
With it's 'Tarang', the beach restaurant.
On a platter natural beauty the duo present.
The divine scenic beauty and its hypnotism
Spell bounds a spectator and pushes him in bosom
Of the mother nature n he enters a trance,
Sitting under umbrella facing ocean Arabian.
Blowing hot air on scorching summer noon
Humid atmosphere soaking in perspiration
Compell even the birds to find their shelter
Leaving solitary ocean with his tides to roar.
Solace could be found from sip through straw
When ambrosia from raw coconut you draw
That can make you in scorching summer calm
Standing beneath meager shadow of a palm.
