Dear diary I have to unleash the pain inside of me
Name is…Charles Hamilton, my pain has been confined you see
But I must let it out on the pages because I rather speak privately
Tomorrow isn’t promised, never paid homage to my elders
I guess that explains my recent, yet prolonged failures
Drop out of high school to rob and steal for the jewelry
People in the concrete jungle snarl and kill thee
But snatching chains wasn’t even cool to me
Wanted to be rapper, and I was looked at as a map with soft fur
A meal ticket, that was easy to bare new friends like a flock of birds
I’m exhausted; I tried so hard to floss it, my music not reaching the masses
Not sticking to the fans like molasses, critics bash it, sticking to me like rashes
Paint picture with words all about detail, but it won’t sale not reaching men or females
These are far more than trials and tribulations; I’m just stuck in foul situations
Addicted to music is a must and a first, when I put time in it things only get worse
Though I couldn’t say forget rap, this beat will soon commence will put me on the map
In fact their problems worse that I couldn’t think of having
If I did have them I couldn’t fathom me lasting
My cousin Chenelle, a female singer
Her voice couldn’t and never fade
Her voice imprinted in my brain
She was lovely we were the same age
She put on shows that you can’t stage
I grow mournful and dry tear as I melted
She said she had a brain tumor but never felt it
Doctors said she got three weeks to live, she still have three weeks to give
As she told me she cried all on the phone in her hospital home
Couldn’t take it, I was scorned, I took my ears away from the phone
She left earth to go to her appointment with Jesus
I couldn’t believe it, but it’s all possible in a bed full of diseases
Why is this world so cruel, God don’t love me
He ignored my prayers, he purposely ignored me
I guess he just never believed me, selling hope to deceive thee
Angels always telling me fables
While my prides being strangled
My life will always be dangled
