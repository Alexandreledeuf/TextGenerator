In that Sin City, with its slot machines,
This gaming guy lost all to loaded dice—
His brothers, his bonds, his villas, his wife.
His sanity—untouched by poker dons—
Slipped when he saw his lady leave for work:
A high-heeled item, a stripper queen.
Jailed and exiled, the brothers served their term
plotting slick war that lasted eighteen days
with mafia shootouts on the streets, and then
there were none but the Storyteller and the Slumdog.
