Away from there in cities Mumbai Pune
Another ocean exists formed of humans.
It too has tides high and still higher
Of immigrants, never to recede, as in ocean.
Theory of objectivism propounded Ayn Rand
Break on exploitation of talent was her demand.
She had come down heavily on second raters
Who stole ideas from genius and were cheaters.
To socialists too she had taken to task
She mounted an attack for tearing their mask.
The clever suck the life blood of genius
They are selfish, inhuman said she, and vacuous.
Leaders cheat people in the name of altruism,
Only selfishness they nurture in their bosom.
Motley plans they devise for the development
With hidden agenda of self aggrandizement.
No doubt they help in development process
By throwing some morsels among the masses
Which too are gulped by their lieutenants
The common man is forced only to lament.
