The blessed one enjoy from birth to death
Easy going, though they are, never face dearth
Of anything to fulfill their almost demands.
They are showered with even unnecessary grants.
After a day long toil the less fortunate
Fail to get the bare comforts needed to live.
To meet both ends together they 've to strive
Though minimized are all of their wants.
Man is a social animal as per a dictum
Yet he has to fight non-stop with enemies
Hidden in hid self embedded in emotions
Greed anger n jealousy are on its spectrum.
Being of same species humans should be equal
Inborn egos in them transform what is real
Into unbelievable n contestable realities
Creating thus, a no of motley entities.
Based soley human life must  be on a religion
Crafted on humanism and not be self centred.
In realityhoweverexist a number of religions,
Propounded by selfless towering personalities.
Common good was their motto and conflict
Subsequently ushered in by the instinct
Of their self centered mediocre disciples
Who ignite and fan it themselves to quell.
