Either they would be independent or martyred they told
And without weapons, enough food, necessary products
They are fully bold
To fight against those armed forces and occupationists,
To snatch complete freedom,
To ensure the glory of flying in the blue sky, ever open
Keeping pace with the rest of the world
Raising head upwards as independent nation;
And they were firmly confident and right
Within only nine months of violent fight
Their spirited body and mind were able to hunt
Too cruel, unscrupulous rulers' blood thirsty forces;
Then long expected, heart cherished victory came
The undaunted heroes wrote the name
Of an independence loving new brave nation
On the centuries' hard stone,
But through a fathomless ocean of bleeding
Lots of valuable, harmless, helpless lives losing,
Chastity, honors of lots of innocent women being violated
And all kinds of huge resources being playfully destroyed.
