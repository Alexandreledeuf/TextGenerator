So content I am today,
This is the very day,
When my Bangla epic got published,
A feat of which I myself am astonished!
It was certainly,
The mercy of the Almighty,
And I could hardly anything ask,
After this Herculean task.
Indebted I am to some persons a lot,
For the utmost love, for the amazing support.
- My Bangla epic 'হযরত শাহ্‌ জালাল (রা.) : একটি মহাকাব্য' has been published at Ekushe Book Fair 2015, Dhaka. I have dedicated the book as a personal homage to the great saint Hazrat Shah Jalal (R.A) . The book is available at Choitonno stall. It contains 2,550 lines.
