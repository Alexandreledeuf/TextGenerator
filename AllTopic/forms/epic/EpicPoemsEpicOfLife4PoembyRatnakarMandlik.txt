Pleasanr breez is ushered in by the setting Sun
The monotony and scorching heat are now bygone.
The over-joyed tides too welcome the change
The warn-out life starts itself to rearrange.
Shocked by the sea and sea shores' magniyide
Overjoyed by the panorama and it's platitude
Tiny tots were building castles with sand
While augmenting sea shells treasure grand.
Inhaling the elixir abundant in the nature
They collected pebbles looking like sapphires.
Happier they were than most of millionaires
By possessing treasure collected on sea shore.
Marvelous inner sanctum of the divine abode,
An embodiment itself of unique magnificence
With it's blood red stones adroitly sculptured
Facing arabian sea it accepts its obeisance.
Lord Ganesha dwells there with pious belief
His devotees make a beeline to pay Him respects
To spill their agonies and all of their grief
Before the Lord, to seek from them respite.
