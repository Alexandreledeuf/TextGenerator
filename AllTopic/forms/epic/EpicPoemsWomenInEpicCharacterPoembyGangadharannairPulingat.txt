I remember the story of Maithrayi
The great scholar, and sage
In Indian tradition she educated
An active argumentative talented
Where she gained wisdom through knowledge
Where she gained acclaims for scholarship
The sanskrit language she conversed
She argued, debated, texts of knowledge
Thousands of years back the epic story
The modern world's inspiration requires
Where women's education, scholarship vital
In all spheres of life, occasion, administration
May a good tomorrow of world we aspire
Sound judgement from wisdom of knowledge
Sound heart the women carries in life
The great responsibility she takes
Every human being a child of women sometimes.
