Deep blue ocean waves
Crawling at ivory white sandy beach
From a long journey
A thousand miles away
From nowhere
Beautiful bubbles
Foamy as your drools
Enchanting melodies
They possessed
They performed
Were your vocals
To ignite the sounds
Of past
Greatest love
Adam and Eve
Rama and Sita
Leila and Majnun
Romeo and Juliet
And Us
Honey, strawberry and cherry
Vanilla, chocolate and raspberry
And caviar
How to picture you
And frame it
In my heart
Even the sun would make way
For us
Enables the moon
To orchestrate
The smiling skies
Spraying the colours
Of mahogany
We ride the rainbows
To milky way
Embracing the chilling breezing
Of the winds
Of Artic
Your eyes
Your teeth
Are sparkling
Resembling the aurora
Of winter nights
Of northern hemisphere
Your lips
As cold as morning iceberg
Transformed into
Ancient well’s water
Flowing into my body
Flourishing my veins
Cooling me
From your warm body
As warm as a volcanic lava
Whenever we touched
Your odor
Smells like the seven layers
Of earth core
Trembling my brain
Guiding them
Not to forget you
If I do
I’d not be alive
And…
Another Epic
Revived.
