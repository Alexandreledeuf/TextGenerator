Standing in shallow water when it is low tide
Experience one can get there of a life time
When the receding water after a high tide,
Washes away sand from beneath your feet.
The surfs hit you hard if to them you stop.
While receeding they push you off-balance.
Pulling you all the while inside the ocean
Narrowing, thus, your life and deaths gap.
The zigzag line of greenary of hilly terrain
Hiding the beach as also sage like ocean
Even fromthe voyager who has set in destination
They guard Ganapatipule like a loyal janitor.
Enchanting is contrast presented by the canvas
Of the silky red soil encircling the beach
As if they want something to us teach
With the green omnipresent floras expanse.
Equally breath taking is celestial confluence
Of the deep blue sea with the sky line azure
Where they mingle in union on the horizon,
Before the Supreme Lord, in obeisance.
