Unpredictability of future is a spice of life,
It may even prove wrong 'as you sow, so you reap'.
Enormous endeavours to succeed may here be flop
Good deeds may be rewarded in place of joy by grief.
Man the social animal has to learn a lesson,
Fortune may not laugh at him with his permission.
Stopping its onslaught may be beyond his power,
Prepared he should be to be a defeated emperoor.
Happy he could be by welcome developments
Grief too he could feel by unwelcome incidents.
Balance of mind be maintained in both the events,
He should not forgo ever his own contentment.
