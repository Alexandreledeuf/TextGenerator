Birth and death are the two permanent stations
Shuttles progeny of parmatma in between them.
Man is mortal but his soul immortal, says Hinduism.
The soul, it says, is Parmatma; s minutest division.
Modern science disciples may contradict the claim.
The theory of rebirth, they may say, is a sham.
Baseless n unscientific to it they may name.
Forgetting possible logic how they can ti it blame.
Biological process in birth they must consider.
New life-cycle starts due to mating of individuals.
Every new born inherits parts of its parents,
Rebirth it is partially pf it's fater and mother.
