Was it an enthralling thought,
or an experience by the artist?
That inquisitive kiss not be missed
to savor the feeling?
Maybe only a fascination
with fleeting thought
upon from artist's mind in a way
that wild fantasy by a surrealist
That painting - The Lovers II, implored
vivid platitude of close-up kiss
and how the inquisitive pleasure be felt
by covering their faces with shroud
For love is sharing whether by sight
feel, sound, smell or taste
Though blind folded, what lies behind?
Is there love?
Upon the stroke of brush
How the pleasure, aftermath of kiss
its symbolism in dimensional shade
illustrated into canvas by the artist
With the concept, how it goes?
Blue-grey, after the kiss, is it with emotion?
Red, after the kiss, is there a trust?
Black, after the kiss what mystery behind?
In all probability, that's how this surrealist
Rene Magritte, painted The Lovers II, from his mindset
