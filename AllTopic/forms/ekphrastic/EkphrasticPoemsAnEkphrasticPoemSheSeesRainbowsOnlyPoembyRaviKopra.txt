Losing three babies in a row
even before they were born
dashing all hopes of motherhood
putting aside the new crib
tiny mittens, scarves, clothes, toys
in a box opened and sealed again,
the chosen pretty names
sarah, sheila, david. robert
slid back once again in memory lanes.
How heart wrenching, how saddening!
When the full term rainbow baby comes
in a bundle of love, crying
what joy it brings to the mother,
there's nothing in this world to compare.
A feeling of blessings, a fulfillment
a sudden emotional surge hard to contain
brings tears to her eyes
holding the baby gently
and guiding her to her breasts
for the nectar of life.
The baby starts sucking. She opens
her eyes and sees the rainbows only.
