O damn the conventional
Parents'arranged marriages!
I don't want to see his
Face. Nor does he mine
No feelings. Zilch
Our kiss, if you call a kiss
Is a parchment rubbing our lips
Our tongues suffocate
I block him. He blocks me
In frustration we suffer
Castrated, neutered we now both feel
And yet we both could not rebel
We are utter strangers
In a cornered nightmarish union
Love by prescription
A marriage made in hell
Imprisoned, oppressed
Our lives out sucked
In the dry sahara of love
Clad in shrouds we're dead.
