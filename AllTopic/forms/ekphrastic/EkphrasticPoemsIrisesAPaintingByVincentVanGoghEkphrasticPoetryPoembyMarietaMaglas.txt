There is an explosion of green life in the light,
This life extrapolates  all its emerald green.
This life needs its eternity to be as tight
And as deep as needed her own son an ice queen.
And all the colors of the rainbow may be seen
In different amounts to the different shades.
Blue irises are placed in a complex world of green.
Into the flower bed, these flowers are like spades.
They need to reassure, as Pantone may suggest,
This world of mystery, which no longer exists.
With pale neutral yellow tongs, they're in great request,
With neutral yellow thoughts, they please the Queen of White.
Alongside darker colors, neutral things sustain
The balance of thoughts serving as background  to pray.
The warm cadmium yellow may accidentally drain
The bad spirits and irises keep them away.
Van Gogh used such a small amount of indigo,
While this indigo conveys truthfulness and trust,
But his emerald green was like a  piccolo,
And through this emerald, his world could readjust.
Using the bright head against the rich blue background,
Van Gogh sent messages writing with his colors.
In  an ochre's religious fight, he lost his ear's sound
To purify this world, where the thought discolors.
