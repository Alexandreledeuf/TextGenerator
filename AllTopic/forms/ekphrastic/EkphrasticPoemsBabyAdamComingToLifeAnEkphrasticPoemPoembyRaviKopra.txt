God created the heaven and the earth
and created the baby Adam
out of the clay of volcanic ashes
with all elements in it
And he put his mouth
over the mouth of baby Adam
and exhaled out souls
A tiny tiny soul slipped
in the tiny heart of
the baby Adam. He checked
the baby Adam's pedal pulse
and lo! he cried out aloud.
'What's the matter, little boy? '
asked the all mighty Lord.
'Where is my Eve? Where is my Eve? '
The baby Adam demanded
in a shrill heart wrenching voice.
'I feel so lonesome without her.'
He was too tired creating the universe
that day. He didn't want to mess with the fresh clay.
God set out to making baby Eve
out of the hanging baby Adam's left rib.
That's why all men now
have a missing rib in the chest
and have a cold cold heart
unlike women who stole men's hearts
and have all the warmth in the world.
