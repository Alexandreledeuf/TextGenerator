Love comes flying in
Our feet defy gravity
We are lifted up, up
And up we fly in the sky
Our hearts enraptured
Overflowing with love
She's my angel
Mine, mine, mine
I am hers, always hers
Joyful, blissful we are
In everlasting love
I adore her wildly
Love her tenderly
Love her beastly
She's my soft flower
Love of my dreams
I want to kiss her
Lick her, caress her
Suck her, drink her
Eat her alive, all alive
She's my love, love
All mine, mine, mine!
