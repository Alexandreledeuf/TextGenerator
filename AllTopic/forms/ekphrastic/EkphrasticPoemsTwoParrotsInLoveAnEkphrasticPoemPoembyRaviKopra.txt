I love you, my yellow rose
Here is my kiss for you
Let me kiss your pinky beaky
My heart throbs when I look at you
No white budgie, I am mad with you
I saw you this morning with muhabbet kusu
I heard what were you saying to her -
My heart throbs for you my sweet kusu
I love you. Let me kiss you.
