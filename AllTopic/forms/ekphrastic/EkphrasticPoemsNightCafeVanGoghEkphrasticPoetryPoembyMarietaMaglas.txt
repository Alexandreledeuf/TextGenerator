Van Gogh wantedto mix a material rainbow of colors
From primary red, yellow and blue in the sense of the divine.
In the Holy Light, the love theme of the flower clock discolors.
The empty glasses on the tables lack the Holy wine.
The ideal round tablesassume their infinite regress,
While huddling down in a stupor the lonely men around.
Their eyes do not see the sense of life and true noblesse.
From a corner view, silent colors search for the sound.
Tables for awakening, for life and for the fate's game.
In life, a complete circled awareness needs time.
In many forms, the epitome of the stableness is the same.
It keeps a purple silence for the painted mother of thyme.
This irreconcilable demon -womanhungon theleft wall
Needs that freedom engraved on the emerald green door.
The watch on her hand shows the time for a masked ball.
Destined never to meet are the parallel lines on the floor.
Love is for completing the time as pink is for the emerald green.
In the mirror, this nuance of green reflects the sadness of life.
Against the red, pink and white, in games, the cue tip can win,
Because all the main complementary colors are at strife.
The white coat of the waiter is asymbol in the glow of the lamp.
The perspective looks somewhat downward toward the floor.
Extending to new dimensions, Eve sits or she just up to vamp.
The flowers wither and life disappears after an endless war.
