Songs Of Nightingale Echo Verse
February 21, 2020
Your favorite bird nightingale
Well,
In day and night
Right,
Pours a tune
How, Leun?
Sweet!
Wait,
You say right and pray much
Such,
A mind, isn't good
Right,
Nightingale at mid night
Spells bound
Its sweet tune,
Dear, Leun!
Methinks, heavenly bird
Right,
Never leave me alone,
Dear, Leun!
I, generally think lot
Quite!
Sometimes,
Hymns!
