From the sky
Or
Beneath the land
I don't know
But
I will keep an eye on you.
Because
"I love you" ♥
My love is so pure
Yet
You knew not for sure
Again
I utter in valley your name and say
"I love you" ♥
Pay attention to my plea
Either
Reply with yes for yes
Or
Yes for No still
Still I confirm and say
"I love you" ♥
This love is not for body
Or
For beauty
Nor
For something that you possess
As woman still I say:
"I love you" ♥
Divinity I saw in you is beyond
Doubt
Only thing I ask for that
Believe
In our union of minds
For the sake of which I say
"I love you" ♥
