Who'll nt stop its work with any try?
Echo-I..
I am rich in taste, and bright,
Echo-Might..
Make me a challenge or a adventure,
Echo-Venture..
I am a strange like a heave,
Echo-Live..
Make me a tear or call me a mess,
Echo-Test..
I am a curse and charm of a youth,
Echo-Truth..
Make me a mirror or be away,
Echo-Way..
I am strict than a Teacher and a lesson to thrive,
Echo-LIFE...
