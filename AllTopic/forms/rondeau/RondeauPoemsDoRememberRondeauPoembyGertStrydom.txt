Do remember my true love when I cannot stay,
when by destiny locked-down from you I am away,
when all of life changes from what we have planned
and then sincerely do trust me and try to understand
that in such a terrible time I can only hope and pray.
Everything, event and day is in God's almighty hand
and I know there will come another pest-free lovely day
where people will live in joy in the world and this land.
Do remember
when separate from me destiny takes you on your way,
where illness and death the virus do at every door lay,
that between you and me remains a bond and a band,
God does care and act as death do at the door stand,
do remember…
