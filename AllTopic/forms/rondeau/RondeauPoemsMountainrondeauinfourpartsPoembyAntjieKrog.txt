mountains from outside are the world from inside
and outside is inside and inside now outside
some ascend mountains to see far
some ascend mountains to lay down the self
some ascend mountains to flee
some simply live on the slopes
some ascend mountains to test themselves
some ascend mountains to create borders
some ascend mountains to honour
some live in caves
simply on slopes
some ascend mountains to rule from there
some ascend mountains to chisel the gods
from in-less outside  from out-less outside
outermost out-less outside
outermost out-less from outside
some live lightly on slopes
some only adore
some watch
how inside and outside are going to pieces
