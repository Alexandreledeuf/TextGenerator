(for Annelize)
I wish I had said how lovely you are to me
and I am saying this with sincere affection
never did I the depth of my love to you mention
while you were of all other lovers free
and daily images in my thoughts of you I see
as if you are in every great and good emotion.
I wish I had said
and daily images in my thoughts of you I see,
never did I the depth of my love to you mention
and I am saying this with sincere affection
how different everything should be,
I wish I had said…
