Lord God, you are mighty, and the source of my smile.
Of all the good in my life, your gifts are the best,
More than in moneys’, in you, I find peaceful rest.
You offer salvation; you it gave with a smile,
To sinners like me, who openly live to defile.
You, Lord, you allow us to rest, upon your chest.
Lord God, you are mighty.
Dear God my sins make a list as long as the Nile
However, by your blood, and grace I ace the test,
O Lord when I did not want you, daily you pressed;
Only to take wasteful wants and give me a smile.
Lord God, you are mighty!
God, I have fault, doubts, I need you to do something about it..
I love you……………………
