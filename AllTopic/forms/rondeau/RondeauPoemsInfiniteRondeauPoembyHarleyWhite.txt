Infinity is what we sense
when musing on the vast immense
with universes yet to mold
in starry heavens still untold
awaiting gazers in suspense.
Astronomers of why and whence
search stelliferous pathways dense,
as dreamers dreamily behold
infinity.
The great sidereal events
in views the firmament presents
upon the cosmic canvas scrolled
shall neverendingly unfold
for poets of the future tense
infinityâ€¦
