Queensland summer strays in to scuttle Spring.
Dissolve its breath; no more its song to sing.
Time now for us to return to the sound of the sea,
its jests, its restless passion, and gypsy-free
follow the gulls, our hearts like theirs on the wing.
For an hour or two each day together we'll bring
books, umbrella: in silent thought we'll fling
last year's old cares, content on Nature's knee.
Queensland summer.
We'll swim on the jelly waves and turn to swing
and stretch our bodies on the breakers' long white string.
Watch children build sandcastles, two or three.
Watch walkers stride the sand like you and me
until the Fall sweeps in with its sighing sting.
Queensland summer.
