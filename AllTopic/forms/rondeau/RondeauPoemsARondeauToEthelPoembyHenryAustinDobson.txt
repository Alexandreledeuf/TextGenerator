“IN teacup-times”! The style of dress
Would suit your beauty, I confess;
BELINDA-like, the patch you ’d wear;
I picture you with powdered hair,—
You ’d make a charming Shepherdess!
And I—no doubt—could well express
SIR PLUME’S complete conceitedness,—
Could poise a clouded cane with care
“In teacup-times”!
The parts would fit precisely—yes:
We should achieve a huge success!
You should disdain, and I despair,
With quite the true Augustan air;
But … could I love you more, or less,—
“In teacup-times”?
