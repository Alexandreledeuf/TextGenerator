With just one boy and daughters (eight!)
a wife and comfortable estate,
I damn both Jacobites and Whigs
who make us dance their bloody jigs
between crossed swords of equal weight.
Neutrality would not vouchsafe
our assets from a victor’s raid;
they’re pinned mid broadswords, sparks and flints
with just one boy.
But Branan’s lads both wear cockades,
there’s white for Camran, black for Craig.
Whoever wins, be it Bonnie Prince
or Cumberland, he’s covered methinks
but I can’t place a bet each way
with just one boy.
