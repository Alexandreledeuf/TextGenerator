If there were no moon dark would be the night;
the sun bereft without her maiden glow.
Our eyes devoid of her seductive light
and all her gifts once lavishly bestowed.
Igniting seas emblazoned in her tow;
invading shores directed by her flight,
waves retreat when once gallantly they rose
if there were no moon dark would be the night.
No harvest fields or phases that delight;
new to full her embodiments unfold
in tangent skies just lonely specks of light,
the sun bereft without her maiden glow.
In our greed, like a trinket she was sold,
now we're lost to the privilege of her sight
and we will weep with stricken empty souls
our eyes devoid of her seductive light.
In vain we want, as often is our plight,
for her return by stellar winds to blow
her back to home! We crave our mother's light
and all her gifts once lavishly bestowed.
