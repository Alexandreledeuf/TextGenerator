As winter's white succumbs to ebb,
Moraine strewn highway spans ahead.
Embattled stretch; asphalt; concrete
Dismal hostage revealed beneath.
Grayscale hues from granite through ash
Exposed were carcasses and trash.
Allowed again to decompose,
Twitch the season; its final throes.
As winter's white succumbs to ebb.
Soon the return of cousins fled.
Harbinger's cue—not all is dead.
Whispered nature—it's almost spring
Chickadees of days grown longer sing.
Soon their song with the garden wed,
As winter's white succumbs to ebb.
