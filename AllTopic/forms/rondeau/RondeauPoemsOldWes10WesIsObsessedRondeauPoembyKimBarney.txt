Wes is obsessed; is that a crime?
He posts this picture all the time.
The girl is pretty; that's for sure,
But I can't take it anymore!
She's much too young; I'm past my prime.
I know he thinks she's just sublime,
But stop this crazy pantomime,
Or Donna will show him the door!
Wes is obsessed.
He won't do free verse; won't do slime,
And all his poems have to rhyme,
But there are more forms to explore.
Give some a try; we won't keep score.
(Just try to sell them for a dime.)
