I still dream of my love in the brightness of our days
When we walked along the beach our love ablaze
When I held her in my arms my own sweet song
Through life’s challenges our love remained strong
Of birthday cards presents and daffodil sprays
Or picnics in a field under a tree where we’d laze
Where lost in that limpid blue of her eyes I’d gaze
It was in my own heart that her love did belong
I still dream of my love
Our love was pure bliss and never did faze
It grew stronger and stronger a flame to a blaze
We thought love would be forever but we were wrong
But nothing is forever and nothing life long
An angel claimed her and left me in a daze
I still dream of my love
