Lethal consequences of the suicide bomber's craft
Are foiled by the vigilance of smart X-ray eyes,
With nations adopting a proactive raft
Of measures to combat these dastardly lice.
Heroic soldiers called up to the draft
Survive IEDs and become street-wise;
Lethal consequences of the suicide bomber's craft
Are foiled by the vigilance of smart X-ray eyes.
Airlines scrutinised both fore and aft
For bombers' machinations in any disguise,
The Intelligence Services never fail to rise
To the occasion, to prevent, by their hard graft
Lethal consequences of the bombers' wiles.
