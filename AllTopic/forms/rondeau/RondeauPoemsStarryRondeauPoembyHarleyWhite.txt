In stellar skies the nights bestow
our firmament's majestic show
with portraits of creations past
that stretch into the heavens vast
surpassing Michelangelo.
We yearn this welkin world to know
through avid searching to and fro
and seek a sculpted cosmic cast
in stellar skies.
Withal, the astral art aglow
o'erspread above in grand tableau
to awe wide-eyed enthusiast
shall mortal earthly life outlast,
as goes the great galactic flow
in stellar skiesâ€¦
