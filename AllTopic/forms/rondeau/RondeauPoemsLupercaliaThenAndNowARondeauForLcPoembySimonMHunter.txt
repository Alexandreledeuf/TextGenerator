“Je suis desja d’amour tanné
Ma tres doulce Valentinée…”
In olden days the Roman maids
Conceive that fleeting beauty fades
Line up along the wintry street
Are whipped by boys with naked feet
In early erotic charades
Troubadours make Occitan raids
Scorn Gelasius; thus crusades
Contra amorous meters meet
In olden days
In Cape Lindh, with its fairy glades
Through love’s thick pools the thinker wades
Curses customs that stain the sheet
Sneers at Žižek’s big Other beat
Unlike the roundabout tirades
In olden days
