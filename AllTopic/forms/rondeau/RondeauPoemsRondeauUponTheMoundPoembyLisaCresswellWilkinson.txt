Upon the mound the town bells ring
Where silence breaks upon the wing
Once lost in time the choir sang
Explosions without joyous bang
A place for those to hail the king
We were once heard; by those who bring
Some peace upon this precious thing
Long gone those days of locals twang
Upon the mound
Solitude a momentous fling
If ye shall utter, thou shall sting
Dont break this one almighty clang
For justice will let you all hang
Upon the mound
