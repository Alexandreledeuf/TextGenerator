The child had a relative Maria. She showed her love
when she smiled with loving eyes, the kind of
love a child needs, while her own mother did berate,
with scolding and insults, showing her hate,
with angels taking notes in Heaven above.
After many years a butterfly came and fluttered above
In the kitchen in the wintertime, uncharacteristic of
Insect life, but was never seen again after it flew straight.
She showed her love.
It was Maria saying goodbye like a dove
sent from Heaven with a solution thereof
to life's problems; Saying â€˜You don't need to wait,
You can come with me to the pearly gate'
In a dream wearing white with her hand to take hold of
She showed her love.
