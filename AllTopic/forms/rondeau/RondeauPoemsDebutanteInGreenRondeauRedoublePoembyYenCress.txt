The young bamboo made her debut:
She sang to me a serenade.
She wore a crown of silver dew
And ao dai sewn of silken jade.
My meetings with the gentle maid
Were secret, like a rendevous,
Until that day, when in the glade,
The young bamboo made her debut.
The breeze was warm; the sky was blue;
The butterflies were on parade;
While 'round her head they danced and flew,
She sang to me a serenade.
The lilies shamelessly displayed
Their gowns of every brilliant hue.
My love stood proudly unafraid:
She wore a crown of silver dew.
Shy little shoots gazed up. They knew
Who most divinely was arrayed-
The young Vietnamese bamboo
In ao dai made of silken jade.
To her, polite respects they paid.
She was the slender maiden who
Deserved their every accolade
The glorious day they came to view
The young bamboo.
