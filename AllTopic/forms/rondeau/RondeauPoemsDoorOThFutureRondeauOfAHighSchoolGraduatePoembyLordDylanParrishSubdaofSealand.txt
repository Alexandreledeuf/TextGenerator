Door o’th’ future, open to me.
Let all of these years speak to thee.
Sleepless, we have woken
and faced thy challenge, broken,
to, at last, set ourselves free.
Free from the past from which we flee
to thine arms by thy most holy
command, which, in love, you have spoken,
Door o’th’ future.
So look upon us fav’rably,
and give us opportunity.
Thy reach shall be e’er unspoken:
thy plan for us, e’er unbroken
as you remain clothed in myst’ry,
Door o’th future.
