we should be glad God’s on our side
with every step, with every stride
as we go marching off to war
like all the times we’ve gone before
with confident religious pride
by certain rules we must abide
these laws of man have been applied
while God sits back and keeps the score
we should be glad
back when our country did divide
with North or South did God confide?
or did He know what was in store
did He pick one side to ignore
or did He say, “I can’t decide”?
we should be glad
