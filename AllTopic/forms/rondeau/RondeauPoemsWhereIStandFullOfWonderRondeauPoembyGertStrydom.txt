Where I stand full of wonder where the sun rises over the hill
with bright light the valley, the plain does fill
while I see the rushing waves rolling in and out of the sea
and there is a kind of joy in me
where I am away of the city's ill.
Here all of nature seems free
although the wind has a kind of chill
and life is peaceful as it is meant to be
where I stand full of wonder
while about me everything seems at ease and still
as if in this part of the world you can do, as you will
and my heart is silent full of tranquilly
as if in this place there is no iniquity
where I stand full of wonder.
