My glitch, though usually discreet
is liable to squeal or tweet.
Part elephant, part plumed mahout
it’s hook-armed with a waterspout
and twitchy as a parakeet.
It’s mostly well-behaved and neat
and friends pretend they cannot see it
but Mummy loves to talk about
my glitch.
I hide it in a draped white sheet
like art by M. Rene Magritte
but sometimes it escapes to flout
the rules or insolently pout
and then I wish I could delete
my glitch.
