So charmingly she was violet-eyed.
As an actress, she was a movie star.
As Isis, she has been really portrayed
For the world, built by the triple pillar.
She found that her time work was amazing
In "aeternum", she searched for her own light.
Wanting to be all, her voice was raising
So charmingly; she was violet-eyed.
While filming National Velvet, her heart
Vibrated like a string of a guitar.
To Judaism, Liz wanted to convert.
As an actress, she was a movie star.
In the dawn's light, she was full of finesse.
An immaculatetalent she remained.
Endowed with a genial consciousness,
As Isis, she has been really portrayed.
She played in the Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.
'Ab initio', she has been a star
In Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf -
The world, built by the family pillar.
As the best actress, she won an Oscar.
In Butterfield, she was magnificent.
She had A Place in the Sun as a star.
Her name will always be significant-
So charmingly...
Dedicated to Elizabeth Rosemond Taylor.
