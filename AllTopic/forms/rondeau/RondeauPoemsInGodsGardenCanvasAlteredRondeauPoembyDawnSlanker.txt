In God's garden canvas
In God's garden canvas, I am the brush;
each stroke deliberate...I never rush.
Creating textured layers as I go,
allying pigment, applying VanGogh.
In reverance, I work in whispered hush.
The Earth, a chalice of flowering rush,
does make this artist's seed burst forth and gush
granting life to lovely violaceous.
In God's garden canvas.
I adopt diffused hues of Claude Monet;
exploit lines, plant colors, the Matisse way.
Sow the obscure lines of Picasso's heart.
Harvest the emotion from Renoir's art.
I am a creative vessel of aide.
In God's garden canvas.
