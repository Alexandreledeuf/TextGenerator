Diane-Down-Under has been a clerk,
but, Lord knows, she is sure no jerk.
She does come up with real cool stuff.
I never leave her writings in a huff.
[To please her Readers, she does not shirk.]
The next five lines (for me)  may be tough;
excuse me please, Readers, if it is rough.
[If I can get through it, it will PERK …. me up.]
She writes both of science AND of fluff,
NOT too much of either, but “just enough”.
I picture her standing on a windswept bluff,
her speech softly female, never gruff,
her words more full of play than of work..
