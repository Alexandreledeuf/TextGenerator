(for Annelize)
I remember you in that summer so happy and gay,
from early morning the sun was high and bright
but now my love, from me you are away.
Lonely I look at the stars in the night
while destiny do people against me incite
but without you my world falls apart and unsteady sway
and where with summer's beauty the days are bedight
I remember you in that summer so happy and gay,
how the wind did as white horses with the waves play,
that rainy winter caught in a tempest storm's might
and then again with you smiling on another sunny day.
From early morning the sun was high and bright
on the beach at the Strand we saw gulls in their flight,
our St. Bernard George ran up and down and sea was grey
and when a freakish wave uncovered you, you were a sight
but now my love, from me you are away.
At times on the beach the wind was full of spray
and almost endless that beach was white
where those times were as happy as they may.
Lonely I look at the stars in the night
and solitary without you is my plight
while out of each other's lives we do stray
but to me you are my love and my light
and I hope that these few words say:
I remember you.
