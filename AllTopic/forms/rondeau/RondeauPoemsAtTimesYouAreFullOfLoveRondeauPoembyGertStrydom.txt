At times you are full of love and you treat me kind
and I easily follow your state of mind,
fall under your charming spell
and although I know you well,
broken things do me of your anger remind.
There are so many things that to you I want to tell,
the depths of your soul at times I want to find
and I hate it when you scream and yell;
at times you are full of love.
I love you too much to leave you behind
but at times on your teeth you do grind
and at times you treat my like hell,
yet at other times you are like a fragile shell
and my whole life to you I want to bind;
at times you are full of love.
