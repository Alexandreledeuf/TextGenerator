It's Christmas Day. I wake so pleased to see
a sky of blue and sunlight on the tree.
I'll be alone but know now I'll get by.
Nature will color my soul and I won't cry.
It's Christmas Day.
I spun one thread to create a family.
Grown and ill he cannot come to me.
I wait and wish his pain was just a lie.
It's Christmas Day.
Life doesn't agree to what it's meant to be.
Untidy notes destroy its melody.
I'll work my poems then later with a sigh
walk slowly to the beach and there I'll fly
with the gulls and wind, then fold into the sea.
It's Christmas Day.
