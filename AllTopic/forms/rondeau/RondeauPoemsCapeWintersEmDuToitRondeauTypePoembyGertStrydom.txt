On the Southern tip of Africa when the southeaster blows with mighty main
oak trees sway, break and are uprooted on the shores
while people shelter indoors
from the daily sieving winter rain,
sunless life seems mundane
while doing the same chores
on the Southern tip of Africa.
Sunless life seems mundane
while people shelter indoors
oak trees sway, break and are uprooted on the shores
and the storm wind rattles every windowpane
on the Southern tip of Africa.
