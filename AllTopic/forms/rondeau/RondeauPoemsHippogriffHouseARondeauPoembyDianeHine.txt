Who’d buy that house named ‘Moly Scale’
on Justice Point that’s up for sale?
I sailed around the Point by skiff;
the old house gripped the tilting cliff
alive behind a vapour veil.
I hid there in a winter gale
which played through tower, eaves and rail,
a contrapuntal eldritch riff.
Who’d buy that house?
Its iron feet impale stacked shale
with eagle claws and horseshoe nails.
Though shingled wings and joints are stiff,
should limestone fail, the Hippogriff
might fly to Shangrila or flail.
