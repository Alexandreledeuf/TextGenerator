For winter is here with cold days and deep snow
The thoughts of hot summers gone long ago
Now days are short and grey clouds fill the sky
And shivering nights that make you cry
Wearing colourful woolly hats wherever you go
And cups of steaming hot soup making you glow
Standing at a freezing bus stop Oh that wind does blow
Then seeing the bus coming and driving right on by
For winter is here
Icicles hanging from houses then dropping below
Like arrows or spears that athleteâ€™s throw
Walking snow in the house Oh nothing keeps dry
The weather forecast is for more snow and you sigh
So hunker down write poetry a Sonnet, Haiku or Rondeau
For winter is here
