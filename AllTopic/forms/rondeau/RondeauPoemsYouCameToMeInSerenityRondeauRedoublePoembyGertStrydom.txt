You came to me in serenity as someone beautiful and gay,
that morning was hot full of sunshine and bright
and all my fears and tears were swept away
while you stayed right through the night.
You were happy, and it was sheer magic despite
the stupid things that I did at times say,
before we laid next to the glowing firelight.
You came to me in serenity as someone beautiful and gay,
where we looked at the wind on the lake in rippling circles play
while the waves were very tiny and without might
on a tranquil, calm awesome day,
that morning was hot full of sunshine and bright
with doves fluttering in their cooing flight
and in the sky there was nothing black or grey,
only the sparkling bluest sight
and all my fears and tears were swept away.
When a storm had risen with foaming spray,
with gigantic waves crushing threatening and white,
something special happened on a rainy winter day in May
while you stayed right through the night.
My love here now I give you my plight,
that even if from me you do stray
if you somehow run away in fright
I will still remember and say:
you came to me in serenity.
