why am I here? am I insane?
is something wrong inside my brain,
do I suffer from some disease?
why wonâ€™t somebody tell me, please,
is someone willing to explain?
there is no reason to complain
the words would only be in vain
I miss the birds, I miss the breeze
why am I here?
my house no longer I maintain
so in this place I shall remain
family members I must appease
to give them all a sense of ease
I miss the sun. I miss the rain
why am I here?
