In the summer we look forward to the sun
To hot sunny days and going for a run
Along golden sands and miles of beach
Then lay in the sun with an ice lolly each
Those long endless days of having fun
With your love two hearts that beat as one
Giving her that teddy bear you have won
In the arcade on the pier Oh life’s a peach
In the summer
Groups of old ladies the heat they do shun
And old men chat about yarns they have spun
Children’s sandcastles the tide will soon breach
And mothers telling their children to stay within reach
Then return to the hotel when the day is now done
In the summer
