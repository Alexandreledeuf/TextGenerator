(for Daleen)
I remember the summer had been so gay,
your smile had been to me a great delight,
but now locked-down from you I am away,
solitary loneliness and missing is my plight.
In this time people do others against the police incite,
the world falls apart with illness and death do sway
and that Balito summer in my memory is bedight,
I remember the summer had been so gay.
Together we picked up shells did in the waves play,
saw yachts sailing in the tempest, in the storm's might,
but throughout that time you smiled on each sunny day,
your smile had been to me a great delight,
on the beach we walked and saw birds in flight,
but the storm-tossed ocean was cold and grey,
beyond this your happiness was a delightful sight
but now locked-down from you I am away,
and away from each other we have to stray.
You are my true love, my life and my light
where there is not much more to you to say,
solitary loneliness and missing is my plight.
In the moonlight the beach was silver-white,
with high tide we were wet and full of spray,
we did joyful wander there by day and night,
every single moment did our happiness portray:
I remember.
