Inter breath my lips dream her hotly kiss
with seamless joy parts the glistening bows
upon my tongue delicacy of wish
my face is flush and time is all aglow.
How sweet I prayed and longed for one of those,
shyness still in hesitancy of lips;
what if there be intrusion of the nose,
my fears consider, what if I to miss?
I'm leaning close and quiet as the mist
with awkward stealth I'm introducing toes,
my arms embrace advancing just a bit
with seamless joy parts the glistening bows.
These links of love with certainty I know
will form our bond; yet, always at a risk
and weave our fates as passion overflows
upon my tongue delicacy of wish.
In this softly place, taunt and intimate
the winds of love adrift and quick to blow
two hearts laced by the lights of innocence
my face is flush and time is all aglow.
Shadows soar then coalesce within my soul
wandering wild, our bodies in a twist,
complete collapse my mind and body fold
inter breath my lips dream her hotly kiss.
