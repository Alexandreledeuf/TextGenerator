A sea squirt's life in larval state
is freely shaped to emigrate.
So nerve cord, tail and tadpole vim
allow one day and night to swim,
a precious chance to vacillate.
A simple eye to navigate
seeks vacant coral real estate.
The choice begins events which dim
a sea squirt's life.
The cord and eye dissociate,
ascidian will vegetate.
The oscillating heart in slim
reflection of life's former whim,
will alternate it's flow to sate
a sea squirt's life.
