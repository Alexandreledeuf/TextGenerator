Osman arrives
The dark thunder lifted her high
Osman arrives
Her black dove took her up to fly
An abomination of war
On her hand, she observed a scar
Osman arrives.
These Western shores
The Byzantine cherubim scream
These Western shores
A coliseum in a dream
Slave drivers rip away their seams.
