Palming marbles down at the pit
Bernice and I roll clay with spit,
all round and pink like Margot’s boil
or Nana’s bunions rubbed with oil.
Baking’ll make ‘em knuckle-down fit.
To play for keeps you need your wits
but watch out for conniving gits
‘cos blue-eyed boys like pinching toys and
palming marbles.
Nana’s marble bag has split
but we collect the ones that slip:
opaque glass swirls all hoity-toity,
crocks and commies – hoi-polloi.
Bernice and I are sitting pretty
palming marbles.
