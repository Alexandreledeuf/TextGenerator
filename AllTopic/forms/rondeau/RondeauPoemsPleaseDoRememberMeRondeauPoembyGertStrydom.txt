Please do remember me when I cannot stay,
when by destiny everything dear is swept away,
when things do not go as we have planned
and then do please still believe and understand
that all the things for which we do hope and pray
is still in the omnipotent Lord's hand
and that there will come a day
where we will be in another land.
Please do remember me
when separate you do go on your way
and be life with hardships as it may
between us there is still a strong band
and even if people act underhand
please do remember me.
