Silence tightly, tugs-
We lose contact, it unplugs.
Disconnected I still wonder
your way. Loving still tender,
But  bliss still lags.
Polluted by pain I lost my legs-
Looking at you blow away the ground pegs
Me here- As you surrender,
Silence tightly, tugs.
Sweet now sour, fruits now figs-
All to waste like rotting eggs
Was it love we fear,
Or luck we lack, my dear?
Our only findings:
Silence tightly, tugs.
