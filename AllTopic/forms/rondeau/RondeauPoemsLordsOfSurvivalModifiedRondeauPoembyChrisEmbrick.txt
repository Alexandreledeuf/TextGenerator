Lords of survival stalk the night
Phantoms beneath the Northern Lights
Hungry, restless the hunt begins
Bonds renewed, they circle downwind
Across the tundra snowy white
Lords of survival stalk the night
Weary elk press on with fright
The pristine forest in their sights
The hungry wolves closing in
Lords of survival stalk the night
Overhead the moon and stars bright
The weary bull too weak to fight
The saga of life played again
On strength and cunning life depends
The distance closed, howls pierce the quiet
Lords of survival stalk the night.
