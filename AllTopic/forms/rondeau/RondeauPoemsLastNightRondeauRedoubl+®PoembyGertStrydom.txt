Last night I saw a big white moon
rising slowly, almost with dignity
and the first star said that it would be dark soon
while you kissed me
and together we lay spoon to spoon
melted into each other softly and tenderly,
in loving activity without any modesty.
Last night I saw a big white moon
somewhat magical like in a fairy cartoon
and outside the wind blowing was the only activity
but you had awoken my harpoon
rising slowly, almost with dignity
while you were smiling in glee
and for a moment I felt like a king or a tycoon
while in joy and passion we were free
and the first star said that it would be dark soon
before everything fell swoon,
we were feeling almost unconscious and you were lovely
when I jokingly pulled my face like that of a buffoon,
while you kissed me
and later I heard you croon
a sentimental song while displaying your breasts carelessly
and I wished to be in bed with you until noon
loving you as sweetly and remembering permanently:
last night.
