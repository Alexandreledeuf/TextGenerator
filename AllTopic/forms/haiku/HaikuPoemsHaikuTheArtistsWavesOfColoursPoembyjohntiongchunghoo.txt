inspired from these quotes:
quopo #1057: Where nature ends
Great art picks up where nature ends.
==Marc Chagall
The aim of art is to represent not the outward
appearance of things, but their inward significance.
==Aristotle
Art is a technique of communication. The image is
the most complete technique of all communication.
==Claus Oldenburg
Art hurts. Art urges voyages—
and it is easier to stay at home.
==Gwendolyn Brooks
What was any art but an effort to make a sheath,
a mould in which to imprison for a moment the shining
elusive element which is life itself—life hurrying past
us and running away, too strong to stop, too sweet to lose.
==Willa Sibert Cather.1915. The Song of the Lark.
Believe those who are seeking the truth. Doubt those who find it.'
.....Andre Gide
