The religion game
only one right way; there can
be only the one.
Fear haunts such small minds
seeing through their broken glass,
blind leading the blind.
No heaven no hell
can remove love from within;
relax and just BREATHE.
The Spirit indwells
beyond the understanding.
A whispering Love
whose strength surrounds us,
guides us along each day; just what
is it, we should fear?
