late November
neighbour beats us again
in dusting the Christmas tree
inspired by:
late November...
I miss another visit
to the nursing home

slender moon
her new gait
after slimming down
inspired by;
slender moon â€”
locking the door
for the last time

Pearl Harbour Day
a  Sept 11 now to mitigate
America's greatest  war foible
inspired by
Pearl Harbor Day
the back yard fence steams
in the morning sun
Lane Parker
christmas
the wish to rewrite
the old songs
inspired by
every one
of her Xmas cookies
the same snowflake
