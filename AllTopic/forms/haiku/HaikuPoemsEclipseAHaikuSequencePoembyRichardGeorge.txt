Imperceptible
at first, sunlight changing; then
dusky, or faded,
filter on the lens
encroaching, sky blue into
grey, then grey-lilac,
colours blur, textures,
shadows cast paler, out of
focus, sudden cold
strikes us uneasy,
half moon sun on leaves jangles
crescent reflections,
dragonflies hawk the
gloom, birds on their way homewards,
green murk of low cloud
BLINKS OUT: OUR DARK STAR,
OBSIDIAN RADIANCE,
CUT CARBON DIAMOND
and back, like a switch,
heavens as dawn six o'clock,
luminous, bleary -
to morning of mornings
and washed-lucid consciousness
reborn we awake
