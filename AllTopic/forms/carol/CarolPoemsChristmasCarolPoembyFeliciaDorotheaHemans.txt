FAIR Gratitude! in strain sublime,
Swell high to heav'n thy tuneful zeal;
And, hailing this auspicious time,
Kneel, Adoration! kneel!
CHORUS.
For lo! the day, th' immortal day,
When Mercy's full, benignant ray,
Chas'd ev'ry gathering cloud away,
And pour'd the noon of light!
Rapture! be kindling, mounting, glowing.
While from thine eye the tear is flowing,
Pure, warm, and bright!
'Twas on this day, oh, love divine!
The orient star's effulgence rose;
Then wak'd the moon, whose eye benign,
Shall never, never close!
CHORUS.
Messiah! be thy Name ador'd;
Eternal, high, redeeming Lord!
By grateful worlds be anthems pour'd,
Emanuel! Prince of Peace!
This day, from Heav'n's empyreal dwelling,
Harp, lyre, and voice, in concert swelling,
Bade discord cease!
Wake the loud PÃ¦an, tune the voice,
Children of heav'n and sons of earth!
Seraphs and men! exult, rejoice,
To bless the Saviour's birth!
CHORUS.
Devotion! light thy purest fire!
Transport! on cherub-wing aspire!
Praise! wake to him thy golden lyre,
Strike ev'ry thrilling chord!
While at the ark of Mercy kneeling,
We own thy grace, reviving, healing,
Redeemer! Lord!
