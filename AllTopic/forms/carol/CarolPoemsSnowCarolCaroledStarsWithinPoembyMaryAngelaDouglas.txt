[for Christ on His birthday-
and for George Herbert and Henry Vaughn...
poets of blessed memory]
love falls away as from the skies
the pearls of former loveliness reprised
return to glaze the dreaming ground
and glide soft stars so all around.
so all around I want to be where
love in crystal surety sings undefiled
and all, for me!
the Mystery
That love is falling from the skies
and we who grew so worldly wise
beyond the din can feel within
the lovely loveliness of God our Friend
that now so gently does descend
our brokenness this way to mend.
