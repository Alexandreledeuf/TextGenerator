In thoughtful walking
Such meditation
Focuses our
Attention on such:
What is so damn wrong
With this state of mind
Condition of world
In meditation
So pure and simple
With body so loose
And mind so relaxed
Thoughts are suspended
Allowing such bliss
To participate
In world of love peace
