‘As the sun that shines through glass,
so Jesus in his mother was; ’
as a babe in cot be laid,
so was He in Mary made;
as ripe fruit in basket laden,
so He ripened in a maiden;
as the scriptures long foretold,
so He came at midnight cold;
as the world wakes to warm dawn,
for the world, was Jesus born;
as God’s message comes to earth,
so He came in human birth;
as the truth has its own sound,
so His Word is spread around;
as wise men are first to know,
so tell all men, it is so:
as the smile upon God’s face,
so He brings us heaven’s grace;
as our hearts are warmed by love,
as our minds are stilled by peace,
so we know the heavens above;
so we know our own soul’s bliss;
as the sun that lights our days,
cradled in each heart He lays.
