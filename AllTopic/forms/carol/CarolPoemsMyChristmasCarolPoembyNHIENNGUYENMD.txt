On this Christmas Day
I pray for the universe
And our planet earth.
On this Christmas Day
I pray for our Human race
And all living things.
On this Christmas Day
I pray for those still alive
And those who were dead.
On this Christmas Day
I pray that we live in peace
As children of God.
On this Christmas Day
I pray for soul conversions
And for God's blessings.
On this Christmas day
I join the heavenly hosts
To praise God's Glory.
