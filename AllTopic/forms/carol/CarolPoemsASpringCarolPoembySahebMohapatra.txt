The hot summer how did make me forget,
Those buds in spring whose I not know,
Earth be staring at sun and I be finding a date,
To claim her with stares and kiss and bow,
Those woods in yellow standing far alone,
All with rare hats and rarest glow,
And all shall be in dark when asks them none,
Like as in good times all try to show.
Long, long I stare at those listless bees,
With my true eyes that minutes not spare,
Then when a golden sunbird at them sees,
Both embrace in nuptials with their breasts, bare.
The more you stare at those glittering flowers,
The more heart shall wish to spend more hours.
