The nearly right
And yet not quite
In love is wholly evil
And every heart
That loves in part
Is mortgaged to the devil
I loved or thought
I loved in sort
Was this to love akin?
To take the best
And leave the rest
And let the devil in?
O lovers true
And others too
Whose best is only better
Take my advice
Shun compromise
Forget him and forget her
