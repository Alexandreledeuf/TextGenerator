Christmas carol
Let the season flow
the sweetness of love,
you know, it's Christmas.
Say Merry Christmas.
Let's decorate, we all,
ornaments and glisten balls,
the Christmas tree tall.
Let your tree grow
Christmas tree of love,
you know, it's Christmas.
Say Merry Christmas.
O! stars of the height!
shine more bright,
illuminate the Christmas night.
Let you and moon throw
the glories of love,
you know, it's Christmas.
Say Merry Christmas.
Everywhere it's good,
fun, feast and food,
happy and festive mood.
Let all of you glow
the lights of love,
you know, it's Christmas.
Say Merry Christmas.
O! girls and boys!
have gifts, sweets and toys,
and sing songs of joy
May Lord pour
blessings and love,
you know, it's Christmas.
Say Merry Christmas.
