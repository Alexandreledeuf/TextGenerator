Though Christmas comes once every year,
Lord Christ was born just once on earth;
The Virgin Mary gave Him birth,
And saved all mankind from sin's fear.
The day reveals God's love for man-
By being born in flesh, a boy;
This brings immense peace and great joy,
And adds true meaning to life-span.
Our Savior chose a bed of hay-
In Bethlehem's, a stable place;
Three Magi, shepherds saw His face,
As angels sang, where Jesus lay.
God's love was born in human form,
And hope afilled each human heart;
God's plan was laid right from the start,
To free mankind from satan's harm.
