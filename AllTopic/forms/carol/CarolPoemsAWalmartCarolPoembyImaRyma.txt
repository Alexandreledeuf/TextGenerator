Walmart, the modern day Scrooge tiz.
Billionaire Walton family
Cares only about greedy biz.
Their workers slave in poverty.
Some union backed Xmas ghosts do
Picket and strike the Walmart stores,
Relentless PR campaign to
Dry up the cash register drawers,
Force this Scrooge from such wicked ways,
Pay more wages, Walmart, or close.
No job's better the more it pays,
As any laid off worker knows.
Go elsewhere with the shopping cart.
Shame the Dickens out of Walmart.
