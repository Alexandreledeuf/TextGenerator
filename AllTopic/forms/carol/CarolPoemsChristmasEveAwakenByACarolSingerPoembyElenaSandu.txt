Five in the morning
I hear some noise
Open my eyes
Find out its a voice.
Voice of a man
He sings an old song
For all to enjoy
A Sweet Christmas tongue.
Tired, but done my best
For my dears around.
Large smiles on their face
These days shall be found.
Time to enjoy
Sing and dance
Time for all hearts
To open their gates.
No needed are keys
No chains nor passwords
Love and forgiveness
Peace of all sorts.
Giving a smile
Sharing good thoughts
That's the best Christmas
I wish to you all.
