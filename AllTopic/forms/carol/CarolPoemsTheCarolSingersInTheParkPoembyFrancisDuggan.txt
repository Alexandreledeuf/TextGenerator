At Christmas i have been listening to it since i was knee height
And i cannot say it fills me with a sense of delight
The carol singers in the park are singing silent night
And among the congregation not an atheist in sight
From generation to generation of Christians this carol has been passed down
And at Christmas sung in every language Worldwide in every village and city and town
And though the sentiments in the words and the music in the carol one can only admire
Of listening to it repeatedly sung over Christmas i for one tend to tire
But we all look at things in a different way
And it is each to their own as the wise one does say
With the carol singers the audience Silent Night sing along
In a show of harmony for peace there can be nothing wrong
The carol singers in the park are singing Silent Night
And among the congregation not an atheist in sight.
