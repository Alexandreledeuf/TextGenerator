Sometimes I wonder in the dark still of night
About you laying cold and white
In sleeps repose, gowned yet dead
A shroud of pills about your head
Your debt to asclepius surely paid
Upon that bed so neatly made
You asked of me a simple task
Not much at all to really ask
Not money nor power, not even wine
Just a moment of my time
To read you a poem
I wonder sometimes in dark the still of night
If I had read you the poem
would it have mattered
