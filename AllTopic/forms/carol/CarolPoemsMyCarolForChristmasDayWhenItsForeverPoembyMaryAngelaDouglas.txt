[to C.S. Lewis]
one day will you wake to say:
the beautiful world has come to stay?
and troubles flee like night
from day
the beautiful world has come to stay
the stars swirl out as in Van Goghs
and all the cherry trees have snows
of flowers deep beneath your feet
when all the winds of Heaven meet.
like crystal in the winter air
before you know the snow is there
something inside the soul will say
the beautiful world has come to stay
