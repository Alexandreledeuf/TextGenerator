It’s a long, long way to Christmas,
But I hear those Christmas bells;
There’s no bird roasting in the oven,
Yet I smell those cooking smells.
There’s no bright gifts
beneath a Christmas tree,
Yet those coloured lights
On green are what I see;
The company of friends,
The love of family;
Carollers singing
From a horse-and-cart;
It’s a long, long way to Christmas,
But it’s always in my heart.
