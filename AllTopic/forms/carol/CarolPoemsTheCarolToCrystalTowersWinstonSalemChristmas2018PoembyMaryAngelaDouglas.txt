I see the downtown civilizations banned
by those with tickets in their hands
to all the glittering soirees
though Im not one to candle gaze
and eat my bread as best I can
and buttered well at God's command
and listening to his sweet leaves blow
around the town where treetops grow
to touch the turquoise skies they love
to boast of to the up and comers here.
have no fear in the yellow castle, tower
set to be banished here at any hour, disposed of.
Be filled with so much Christmas cheer
for shepherds saw a Lovely Light on Bethlehem's plain
and they were poor with the sheep so often in the rain
but it is right
they saw the glory Kings could not.
and I still know He's not forgot
the King in lowly manger born
all those still here
the small and worn the ones they'll move to outer space
to own the glitzy downtown space with one accord.
He's not ignored
who sees the smallest sparrow fall
and doesn't like the proud at all.
