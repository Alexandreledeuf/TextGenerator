Christmas stands at the door and knocks
The coming king, small, dependent, sleeps
Visitors from near and far, high and low
Called by the heavenly host and cosmic sign.
Stand in awe, as all creation looks on.
We to should stand  reflect upon his coming
Ask the question of ourselves, what brought us here?
What do we expect to find this night and Christmas morn?
This birth unlike no other, brings change to the world
To all creation a cosmic Kingship celebrated
In the heavenly realms as on earth, alleluia.
