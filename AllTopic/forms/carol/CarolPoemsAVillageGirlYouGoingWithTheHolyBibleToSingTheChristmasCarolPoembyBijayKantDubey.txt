Christina, you a village girl
Going with
The copy
Of the holy Bible
Into the hands
Of yours
To sing a Christmas carol.
The countryside,
the wilds,
The houses with pastoral settings
With the blooms
Bedecking,
The shepherds frolicking,
The psalms and hymns
Taking the days.
Come, come Christina,
Come and sing you
The carol
In the company
To celebrate happy Christmas,
Light the candles,
The bells tolling,
the Cross sparkling.
