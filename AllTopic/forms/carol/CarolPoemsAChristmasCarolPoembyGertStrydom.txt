On a early summer day
while shepherds fed their flocks hay
all the earth was rejoicing
about the coming king.
Angels sang, appeared in great glory
and told scared men the blessed story,
early in the morn, of the child being born,
the Prince of peace, the creator God, Jesus the Christ
for whom a manger sufficed.
A star guided wise men right through the night
they followed its bright light
and over a stable it halted its flight
where they found the child they sought
and bowed before the king
seeing the mild maiden mother glowing
with admiration, worshipping Him,
they gave the treasures that they brought
and the world was at peace
while God walked among men
and now like then:
giving out His love that never ceases.
