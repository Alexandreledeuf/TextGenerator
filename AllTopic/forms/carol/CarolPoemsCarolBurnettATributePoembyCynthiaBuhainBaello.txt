Against all odds you rose
To reach your many dreams
And turned around the words of those
Who had no faith in you, it seems.
Indeed, you found your place
Where you gave what you had best,
Put so much laughter on my face
I was blessed by your comic jest.
The years had seen you bloom
Where the stage had been so kind
In our homes you always had room
No funnier lady I could find.
I'd like to thank you for the laughs
The shows that bring back memories
And your life did more than enough
To touch it somehow with cheers.
