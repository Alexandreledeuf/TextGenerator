Good on you there dear C McCoy
You spread the simple gift of joy
You sing so well your voice so clear
And pleasing to the listening ear.
Must say your talents I admire
One of the best in Sherbrooke Shire
For you the peals of applause ring
Each time that you stand up to sing.
I only know your face to see
And doubt that you've heard tell of me
So my opinion must hold weight
When I say some your talents under rate.
You never cease to give delight
And so often you have made my night
Yet it's not your voice though good it be
But your bubbling personality.
So good on you there Carol McCoy
And keep on sharing your gift of joy
You sing so well your voice so clear
And pleasing to the listening ear.
