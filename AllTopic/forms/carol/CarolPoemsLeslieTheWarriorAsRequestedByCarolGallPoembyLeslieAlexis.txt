A bronzed chest makes me look warlike,
But my tongue is the only weapon I yield
Ten times stronger than steel is this sword,
Therein lays my potency – in my written words!
Paint half of my body, to receive the outer side,
Touch my pen once, only to fear the coming tide.
Touch my heart and thine own I shall too,
Kiss me but once, and it would be I and you.
Slay my pains, to my face bring in bunches smiles
Doing it best, have your father meet me at the aisle
And only then, righteously, let our legs entwine
Let my body be yours, and yours be mine.
Break and bruise my body, leaving but my head;
I rather die now, than to then be found dead,
Usurp all my wealth, make me humbly kneel,
Take all things fleeting, leave that which is real,
Smash my bones, if it means I would serve my God,
When I’m wrong, give with much grace love’s rod.
Bless my pen that it might never go low on ink
Give me surplus, make evident before they can wink,
Leash my neck, that at furthest I’ll tinkle your name,
Never let me stray; never let my doing be for fame,
Make bigger my heart, that forever I’ll do your will,
Fill it to the brim with love; give until it can spill,
Then give more,
Let it not keep to spoiling, then pour
Always renew afresh… and...
Leading my path, always give more,
That we may stand victorious at the end of the way.
