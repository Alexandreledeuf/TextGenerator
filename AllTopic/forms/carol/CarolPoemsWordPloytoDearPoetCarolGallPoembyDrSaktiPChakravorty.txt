WORD PLOY
esspeecee …12.08.09.
[To Dear Poet Carol Gall ]
# You’re on Quick-List summit
My heart’s joys vastly beat
It’s a la gala treat.
# Stay there
Watch you from here.
# Poet Carol
I know you’re for all
Swing and bow emotions like doll.
# In your poetic sojourn
I’ll be your companion
Support you as I can.
# Share my joy
It’s my coy
Words to you toy
Enjoying your word ploy.
