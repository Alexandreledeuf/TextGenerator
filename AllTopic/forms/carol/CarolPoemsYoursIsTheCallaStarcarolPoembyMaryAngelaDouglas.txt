yours is the calla star
over the manger, bending
the diamond refraction
of ultimate stillness
mere breathing causes
the air to chime but angel feathers
cannot quell us
jangling childhood's mismatched bells
we stop bewildered, at the halo round
our footsteps in the snow and
looking straight up
we keep forever
all the lilies in the night sky
all the lilies-
