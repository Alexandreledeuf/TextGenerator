Looking back upon my youth as
the holiday season is near, I can
recall the happiness filled with
excitement as each day approached
I remember the days when Daddy would
take us out to cut our very own Christmas
tree, and of course, it was the most beautifull
tree of all
Bringing it home and decorating it with
lights of green, red, blue, mother made hot
chocolate and chocolate chip cookies for the
event, as Daddy was always in his usual place
the kitchen trying feverishly to 'unweb'
last years string of lighting, we had no
stores to run out to get last minute this or that
so we had to make do with what we had like
every other family and Daddy always came through
and the finishing touches were done with tinsel
and of course the star up top to offically indicate
Christmas was now on its way
Looking from my window at night, looking out
at the street light which was covered
with freshly fallen snow, seeing tiny ice clycles
casting their wintery shadows seemed like tiny
snow fairies doing their snow dance, the trees
were coverd with white snow caps which made
a setting like a winter wonderland that would
stay in my heart forever
Todays world has become so commercialized
that the beauty has been taken away somehow, I sound
like a very old sentimental fool,  but I would not trade
those days of my memories from an era where
family knew how to celebrate Christmas with the
family spirit of togetherness
Christmas is that time of year when it
brings you back to the time when happiness
shadowed each and every jingle bell that
we rang filled with much joy and love
From my heart to yours, this is my Christmas
Carol to each and every one of you......
