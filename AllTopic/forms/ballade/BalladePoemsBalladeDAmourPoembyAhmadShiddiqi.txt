(dedicated to Mr. Krystian Zimerman, a great pianist)
a rich ethnographic
a vaulted ceiling
ornate windows
carved glasses
colorful lace
floral patterns
folk embroidery
priceless codices
lyrical and dramatic
narrative qualities
contemplative
elegiaque
wh ite stones
wooden benches
decorated frescoes
an exquisite mansion
a chateau in your heart
soaring longing voice
conquer the anger
no more sadness
a love come true
hillside vineyards
melodious memories
excellent wines for lovers
(inspired by Pierre-Auguste Renoir's In the Garden)
