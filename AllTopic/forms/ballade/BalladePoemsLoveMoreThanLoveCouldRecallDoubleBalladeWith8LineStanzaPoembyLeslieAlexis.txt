The sound says love is not a crush;
As one we moved from plain to dote.
The love became more than a blush.
You are my boo, that is my vote.
My words are true, no need to note.
I love you, Anne; with my very all!
You’ll know by actions that cause rote;
A love more than love could recall.
The sound is song of a blue Thrush,
It sings a song that please by mote.
His feathers are a stunning plush,
His owners are the wealthy Vacote,
They live by bay and have a boat.
Let’s dance on this oceanic ball,
I know it’s love that keeps afloat.
A love more than love could recall.
Let love speak- every qualm stay hushed.
The birds' song tells the love I wrote.
The song says my heart goes to mush,
I love you so much that I do gloat;
Each day our love I do promote!
The love you give me does enthrall..
My days to you I do devote;
A love more than love could recall.
Our hills are big and very lush,
They’re full of plums and then a cote,
That keeps safe mistletoe's thrush
A bird that sings the lovers' note;
There even lies a pretty goat!
To give, I have the wherewithal,
On my word, I do not misquote,
A love more than love could recall.
Look at the waves, how they do gush
And beat on the stockades of the boat,
With one weak spot the boat could crush
To portions that are very mote.
But it does not; we are the boat!
For never will we sink and fall!
These are the words we need to note.
A love more than love could recall.
(Anne)
Let us be timed, let us not rush.
I wish we fly and never float:
forever our time will be flush;
Our love forever will be rote,
As we pilot our joyous boat.
Your face hangs on my every wall.
In love, you too have my true vote;
A love more than love could recall.
Upon the sea, upon this boat,
I stand to shout aloud this call;
Our love, both man and God will note;
A love more than love could recall.
