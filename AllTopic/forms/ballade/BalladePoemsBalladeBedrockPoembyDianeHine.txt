Laurasia and Gondwana pressed,
volcanic vents disgorged Earth's brew
and from the shallow sea a crest
of ragged, blackened islands grew.
Below the waves the sea's floor slew
and swallowed layers of ashy grist.
The mantle forged the mineral stew,
recrystallized Manhattan schist.
Green copper, gold capped, self-possessed,
crowned heads aloof in pallid blue.
Steel chests, attired in natty vests
attending street and avenue.
Art deco, choice of parvenu-
brass, nickel, chrome, aluminum twist.
Foundations; granite, concrete glue
recrystallized Manhattan schist.
September Central Park is dressed
in greens; oak, maple, elm and yew.
A bloated rain cloud bursts in jest
and hazed skyscrapers fade from view.
The washed rock outcrop's subtle hue-
eclectic greys blend amethyst
and glinting mica sparkles through
recrystallized Manhattan schist.
Beneath thin air where chaos blew,
the trace of lives in bronze persist
and trace of fragile bones imbue
recrystallized Manhattan schist.
