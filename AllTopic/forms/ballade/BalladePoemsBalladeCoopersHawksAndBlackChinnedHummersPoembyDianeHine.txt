The wary suitor bows with care;
he’s mate or meat to a girl this size.
But no, she loved his aerial flair
so hawks unite with fluttered sighs.
They gather sticks, sing lullabies;
he hunts, she broods, he kills, she rips
and downy hatchlings harmonize
a charming woodland partnership.
The hummingbird male threads tunes through air
with breakneck, spread-tailed, pendulum dives.
She’s dazzled by his savoir-faire
and swift love ends with swift goodbyes.
She gathers spiders’ webs and plies
a stretchy nest of soft leaf tips.
While wings and heartbeats race, time flies
in charming woodland partnerships.
Her nest lies near a hawk pair’s lair.
When she’s away they’ll supervise
and she’s too fast for hawks to snare.
The hawks are sure to capitalize.
They see her eggs as merchandise
enticing jays to risk a trip.
Some odd bedfellows socialize
in charming woodland partnerships.
If prey eludes a hawk’s red eyes
or if a hummer’s vigil slips,
then hunger pangs can strain the ties
of charming woodland partnerships.
