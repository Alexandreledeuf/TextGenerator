'There has been death in the morning,
death in the noon-time,
on the highways and skyways,
death by faceless people
who said they are warriors.
They are not warriors.
Whose cause is being served?
Certainly not the cause of God,
not the cause of Allah,
because it is God Almighty
who gives life
and is full of mercy.
How much blood must be spilled?
How many tears shall we cry?
How many mothers' hearts must be maimed? '
