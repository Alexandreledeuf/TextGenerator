Where is he now?
Him who fell away.
Him who noticed the shrieking of boys.
Silent, he watched, unbelieving,
The fire among him.
Where is he now?
Him who was scared away.
Him who watched the noises,
Watched as they screamed.
Watched as they gasped for a right to speak.
In hell, he burned
Among the fire.
Where is he now?
Him who went away.
Him who was not one with the others.
Him who was not on the list of names.
Him who was rescued.
One with the fire.
