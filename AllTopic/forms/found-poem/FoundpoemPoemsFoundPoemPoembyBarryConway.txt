FOUND POEM
IN THIS BUILDING OF SMELLS,
AROMAS RISING UP TO MEET LIPS,
EMANATING SOUNDS AND WHISPERS,
FROM THE WAVES OF PEOPLE,
THAT VISIT YOUR EYE.
THEY FORM A GALLERY,
BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE,
TREADING THE BOARDS,
FOR DOES NOT THE GREAT BAIRD SAY,
ALL THE WORLDS A STAGE,
AND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN,
MERELY PLAYERS.
YOU WATCH THEM,
FLOW BACK AND FORTH,
FROM YOUR COUCH OF LIFE,
AND WONDER!
IS THIS WHAT LIFE IS ALL ABOUT?
