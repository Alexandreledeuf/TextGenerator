Rest
the body;
sleep.
Isolate
from the body;
join
the unknown.
Open,
the other side
of reality;
open,
the mystical center
and most powerful
area
of the brain;
the highest
source
of energy,
where
ethereal harmony
controls
the body.
When consciousness
closes,
and
the third eye opens
(extending vision
beyond the gate
that leads
to inner realms
to see
beyond space-time) ,
gaze upon
the deep
mystery light
behind the universe
to understand
all
your hidden thoughts;
connect
with all
consciousness;
see,
feel,
focus;
allow
the physical body
to awaken;
to return
unlike before,
and trust,
what you see.
