'To be a poet, it's a challenge to do it in poverty, to do it in wealth, ' Myles says. 'To do it in the academy, to do it in a relationship where you're happy. Everything changes the game. To do it in the awkward state of love, despair, dying. You just have to work it.'
To be
a poet
is a challenge
to do it
in poverty
to do it
in wealth
to do it
in the academy
to do it
in a relationship
where you're happy.
Everything changes
the game
to do it
in the awkward state
of love
despair
dying.
You just have
to work it.
