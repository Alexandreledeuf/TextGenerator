An immense impact
on many,
only
to please the eye,
instead of the mind;
make music together,
seven children die,
and four,
away from home,
follow in footsteps
and focus time,
to visual symbols
of life.
Follow a group,
a group
serious on visual matters
of imagery
manifest with
the fourth dimension
(a corridor,
moving about
parallel distortion)
overlapping elements
convey
unseen mental fragmentation.
They say,
the ego
is always there,
in everything;
the self?
little is known
in surreal forms,
and ideas?
the end
of logic and sense.
They attempt
to remove the living realm,
and work on areas
in which matter,
created solely
by the mind,
could be true things
themselves.
Things,
outside the knowable reality,
reflect the creation
of the person who formed it;
truth,
during random positions,
lost.
Simply looking,
looking
at all four being found,
as well as others,
in the course
throughout time.
