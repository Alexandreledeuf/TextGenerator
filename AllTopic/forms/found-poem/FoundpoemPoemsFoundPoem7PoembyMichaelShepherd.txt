What does happen occasionally
is that Kenny gets an idea for a dish
and writes on the specials board
- yes, there is a specials board -
something like Indomalekian Sunrise Stew.
(Kenny and his oldest son, Charlie,
invented the country of Indomalekia
along with its culinary traditions.)
A couple of weeks later, someone
finally orders Indomalekian Sunrise Stew
and Kenny can't remember what he had in mind
when he thought it up.
Fortunately, the customer doesn't know, either,
so Kenny just invents it again on the spot.
