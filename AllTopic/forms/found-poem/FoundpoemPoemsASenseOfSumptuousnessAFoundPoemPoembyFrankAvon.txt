A poem
is something of a list,
[a poet of the tribe of postmodernists says]
a list of phenomena
and reaction
that may or may not
lead to a conclusion.
It's not a story,
it's an arrangement.
[It hopes to]
resist narrative
and its numbing conventions
that depend upon domineering logic,
which is insufficient to
the full welter of life.
We don't live narratives.
We hop.
[Such a poem]
conveys a sense of amazements
in each landing and takeoff.
It comes to a sense of ending
that isn't necessarily completion
but more like how a song ends,
with a sense of
sumptuousness achieved.
