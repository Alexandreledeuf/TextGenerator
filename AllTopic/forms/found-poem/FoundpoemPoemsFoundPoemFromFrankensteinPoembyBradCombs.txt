Day after Day,
Week after Week,
(Pg 108, Ch XVIII)
CURSED, CURSED
Creator,
(Pg 97, Ch XVI)
My travels were long,
And the sufferings I endured intense,
(Pg 100, Ch XVI)
Nature decayed around me,
The sun became heatless,
Mighty rivers were frozen,
(Pg 100, Ch XVI)
My sufferings were augmented,
My daily Vows rose for Revenge,
(Pg 101, Ch XVI)
Can you wonder what such thoughts transported me with rage?
(Pg 103, Ch XVI)
I am malicious because I am miserable,
Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?
You, my Creator
Would tear me to pieces! And yet not call it murder!
(Pg 104, Ch XVII)
Shall I respect men when he contemns me!
When injury is bestowed upon me instead of kindness!
When you My Creator
Would precipitate me into one of the ice-riffs,
Destroy my Frame,
The work of your own Hands!
(Pg 104, Ch XVII)
Why should I pity man,
More than he pities me
(Pg 104, Ch XVII)
The human senses and insurmountable barriers to our union
I will revenge my injuries,
If I cannot inspire love,
I will cause fear
Chiefly towards you Creator,
My Arch-Enemy
(Pg 104, Ch XVII)
