Wassily Kandinsky (1886 - 1944) ,
the originator of abstract art,
believed that art could visually
express musical compositions.
An accomplished musician, he saw
color when he heard music,
and associated a color's tone
with musical timbre, hue with pitch,
and saturation with the volume
of sound. Kandinsky named his works
after musical terms. Originally
a lawyer in his native Russia,
he was inspired to study art...,
after seeing Monet's 'Haystacks.'
Kandinsky was gripped by a compulsion
to relentlessly create, and believed
that if this drive were pure,
it would evoke a powerful response
in viewers of his work.
