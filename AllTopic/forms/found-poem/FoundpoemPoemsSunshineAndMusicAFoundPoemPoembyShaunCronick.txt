A laugh is just like sunshine,
It freshens all the day.
It tips the peak of life with light,
And drives the clouds away.
The soul grows glad that hears it,
And feels it's courage strong.
A laugh is just like sunshine,
For cheering folks along.
A laugh is just like music,
It lingers in the heart.
And when it's melody is heard,
The ills of life depart.
And happy thoughts come crowding,
It's joyful notes to greet.
A laugh is just like music,
For making living sweet.
