To be the ghetto
Wiped out completely
Trudgeons struck the police
On Hungarian rifle butts
To left without reason
Old men falling their blows
Upon old children and invalids alike
Faces streamed from bodies
Water cried for children
Empty tombstones began their journey
Dreams passed like a small summer Monday
And blows with hysteria and outbreaks of trudgeons
The little ghetto were only to move
Mummy!  Water!  Mummy!
The gardens glance backward at the dead
Water cried.
