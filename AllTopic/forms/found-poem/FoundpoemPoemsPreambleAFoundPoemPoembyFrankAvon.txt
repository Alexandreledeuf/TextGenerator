The world of woods and water and fields -
and the sidewalks children use
to walk home from school -
are among our greatest teachers.
Perhaps it will not be my generation
that wrenches creation back from the brink;
perhaps it will be the next one.
But only if they know it,
love it,
were once loose and free
to wander in it.
