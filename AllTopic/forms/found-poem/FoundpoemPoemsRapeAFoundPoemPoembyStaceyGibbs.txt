It’s too loud out here.
Yeah.
Wanna go upstairs?
Sure, lead the way.
Okay.
It’s too dark in here.
I know.
Could you turn the lights back on?
Shhh…I don’t want my friends to hear us.
Why?
Because they’re complete asses.
Oh.
Are you gonna sit down?
Where?
The bed is over there.
Okay.
You’re really pretty.
I am?
Yeah.
Hey. Take it slow.
Uh-huh.
Stop it!
Uh-huh.
No! Stop it! No!
You know you like it.
I said no! Please, stop!
You’re a whore and you want it!
No! I’m not a whore! I said no!
Here, get cleaned up.
Nooooo!
Don’t tell anyone about this!
Don’t touch me!
Because if you do, I’ll kill you!
