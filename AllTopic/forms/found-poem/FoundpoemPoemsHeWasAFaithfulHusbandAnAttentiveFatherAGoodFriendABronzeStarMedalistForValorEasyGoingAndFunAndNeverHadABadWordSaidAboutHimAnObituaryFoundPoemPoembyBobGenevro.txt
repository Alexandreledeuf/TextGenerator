Robert Bishop (1918-2009)
was born in Hibbing, Minnesota.
He was a devoted husband to Jane
until her untimely passing in 1985.
Three years later
he attended his 50th high school reunion
and met classmate  Dorothy Nelson.
After 2 years of correspondence
and flying back and forth from San Francisco to St. Paul
they married and enjoyed 10 wonderful years together.
For the last years of Robert's life
he enjoyed a warm relationship with his companion
Alice McKinney.
Robert was one of those rare persons that never had a bad word said about him.
He was well liked by everyone that met him and knew him.
He was easy-going, affable and fun to be with.
He was a hard worker
a faithful husband
attentive father
a good friend and neighbor.
He was unassuming
and you would never guess
that he was awarded the Bronze Star for valor during WWII.
He did not like to talk about his exploits during the war.
He was a sports enthusiast.
He took great pleasure in cheering
at the games of his 5 grandchildren
Steven  Ned  Katherine  Grace  &  Faith.
We will all miss his charm and humor.
He was a wonderful person.
