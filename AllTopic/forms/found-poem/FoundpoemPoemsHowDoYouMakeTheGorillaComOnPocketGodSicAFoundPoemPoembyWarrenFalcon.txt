Light the torches using lightning,
place one islander on that central beacon
(he'll stick there spread eagle) .
Then, place one islander on
the drums on the right side,
and one on the crank on the left.
Their eyes will glow red.
Make sure it is night time,
then in a circular motion with
your finger, make the possessed
little dude on the left turn the crank,
spreading the hapless guy in the middle out
... but JUST until the little lights on
the bottom of the altar turn on...
crank too far and he'll explode.
THEN, FINALLY, lightly tap the
drums under the islander on the right...
and voila.
King Kong will eat the guy on the altar.
From there, you will have a bored gorilla.
NOTE: A bored deity is a DANGEROUS deity!
