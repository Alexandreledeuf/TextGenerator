More than Words
PART III: Found Poem
This is my letter to the world (Line 1 from "This is my letter to the world")
That perches in the soul- (Line 2 from "Hope is the thing with feathers")
To comprehend a nectar (Line 3 from "Success is counted sweetest")
To a discerning eye- (Line 2 from "Much madness is divinest sense")
At recess-in the ring- (Line 10 from "Because I could not stop for death")
A wooden way, regardless grown (Line 7 and 8 from "After great pain a formal feeling comes")
Between the heaves of storm- (Line 4 from "I heard a fly buzz when I died")
It yet remains to see (Line 2 from "My life closed twice before its close")
What portion of me be (Line 10 from "I heard a fly buzz when I died")
So huge, so hopeless to conceive (Line 5 from "My life closed twice before its close")
A quartz contentment, like a stone- (Line 9 from "After great pain a formal feeling comes")
My tippet- only tulle- (Line 16 from "Because I could not stop for death")
And all we need of hell (Line 8 from "My life closed twice before its close")
