hey babe, it's your girl julie ;)
Want to tell you that so far
i'm having a great summer,
how about you?
I went to the beach yesterday with my friend Sara,
and many people hugging and kissing there,
which made me feel bad
since I don't have that special person,
you ever feel like that?
My college is over for now, but
I'm working a little as a waitress, and
I must say there are many rude guys out there
who give me bad compliments,
but I'm getting used to that;
the weather is awesome here, can't complain there :)
Anyways, my cam is on
and I'll be home whole week,
I just didn't know how to put it online,
so what I did is connected it
to some network which all it needs
is age verification..here's my site....
let's meet each other finally...
bye, jules :)
