Starless midnight of racism and war
in the silence of good people
come here on different ships
Change the system
justice, love, peace
become a reality
in the bright daybreak of peace
unconditional love
the final word
Walk in the light of creativity
stand at times of challenge
work for our freedom
in the same boat now
