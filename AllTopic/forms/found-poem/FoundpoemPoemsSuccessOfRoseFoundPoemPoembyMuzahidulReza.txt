Success Of Rose - Found Poem
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Butterflies, bees and small birds come near
To collect the pure and sweet nectar;
The rose lovers eagerly look for the rose
Thus the rose in its life attains success,
Lo, how a rose does bloom showing purity!
How it does spread so sweet smell!
How the soft and colorful petals unfold beauty!
Then how a complete rose attracts all!
Blooming in and out of garden even in wilderness
How the rose to all becomes virtually dear!
A great lesson for all it also does bear
That is to bloom the rose in nature for all like her;
Here is not all, in times it becomes example
We do say, "You are just like rose,
Coming in the earth you should bloom all
Just rose for other and earn rose like success."
