Main sub kuch bhool jata hoon
lakin kabhi nahin bhoolta
tujh se milnay ko
dooba rehta hoon main
teri yaadoN main
Mujhe abhi abhi aisay laga
k dum nikal jaeyga mera jaldi se
bahut dukhi ho jaunga main
mil na saka agar marne se pehlay
Mujhe hairani hua karti thee
k log dharam pe jaan de datay hain
ye soch kar main kaampanay
lag jaya karta tha
nahin, ab aisa bilkul nahin,
main ab de sakta hoon
apni jaan dharam k liye -
mohabbat mera dharam hai -
mar jaunga main mohabbat k liye
mar jaunga main tere liye.

I am forgetful
of every thing but
seeing you again -
my Life seems to stop there -
I see no further.
You have absorb'd me.
I have a sensation
at the present moment
as though I was dissolving -
I should be exquisitely miserable
without the hope of soon seeing you...
I have been astonished that
Men could die Martyrs for religion -
I have shudder'd at it -
I shudder no more -
I could be martyr'd for my Religion -
Love is my religion -
I could die for that -
I could die for you.
-John Keats
