Carnival of wonders
Marketing in dreams
Venders of miracles
Bazaar magic and nonsense
Market of the Faeries
Casting through the chimes
And cries
Exotic smells
Strange faces
He found her
And she gave him a flower
And stole a kiss
Promised him everything
Gave him his Heart's Desire
All he had to do was hoot
Like a little owl
And the meadow made a bed
And the stars were a room
And she gave him things he'd never had before
And the exotic girl a slave
Whom his love could not free
She held him spell bound
And the night was wrapped in gasping breaths
The heat of kisses
The salt of tears
And two people so close they took the space of one
The heavens glittered
And the starlight sang
Soft hands roamed along free expanses
And they lay together quietly
For a while
Then the world woke around them
And the silk of her raiment once more covered her
Lavender eyes closed a final time
The last of the blackberry kisses
And she stole back to the caravan
While he was left to wonder
If she had ever really been there
While he was left to wonder
On faraway places
And magic never dreamed of
