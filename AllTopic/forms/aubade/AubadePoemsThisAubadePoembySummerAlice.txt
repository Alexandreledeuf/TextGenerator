It's not like the one nine Novembers ago
with someone else who rose differently than you,
his arm clicking my bed's Christmas bulbs
going to my desk for my cloves.
This morning's floor is white and
the feel is hard and good,
a different body,
the dark getting undone over us,
iced up windows shining
on some sex, alchemy, flux
the city with many positions.
Students with stacks of Spain, Isherwood, Cather-
a good loud voice, naked, holding Paul's Case...
It was its own place, another music.
There was a thicker meat to words then.
More of the day comes.
I'm pacing across your floors again.
I'm not finishing sentences.
I go to the birthday party.
I'm okay I've got Vodka
and all this
similar mutibility
engaging me.
Cake, flirting, Roxy Music.
Other rhythmic prolix.
