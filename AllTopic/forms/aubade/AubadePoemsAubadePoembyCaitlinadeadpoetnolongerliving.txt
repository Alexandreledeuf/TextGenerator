Aubade
A word lost in time
Unlike its cousin
Serenade
Aubade, morning song
Serenade evening song
Why did Serenade survive?
The word evokes images
Of a lovestruck young man
Vocalizing his desire
To a young maiden all aglow
At eventide
Dawn presents another picture
An individual again at song
But with a different audience
Not a person but the environment
Perhaps we need to resume the practice
Fill our lungs
Sing out aloud our own joy
At yet another day
Another dawn with sun ablaze
Another day with possibilities abloom
Around 2000
