Train chuffing, prayer in the mosque, milkman's calling,
Albarado playing, slumberous moans,  water running, ,
Newspaper tumbling, , eggs frying, phones ringing,
Crows cawing, hymns chanting, leaves rustling,
These are the beautiful sounds of early morning.
Glasses clinking, breaking news, women praying,
Birds chirping, old lady sweeping, joggers mumbling,
Alarms chiming, toilets flushing, babies wailing,
Peaceful, melancholy, matinal silence
These are the beautiful sounds of early morning
