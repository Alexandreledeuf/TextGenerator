The land rejoiced and laughed,
Daffoldils hopped for Joy.
To The remonstrating trees, was contentment served,
All pleasantries to all pair coiled.
The cloud swathed in radiance,
Graced was the hay's countenance.
The scent of birds unveiled.
The sycamore liberatingly yawned,
All nature take leisure turn after turn - -
The dawn arrived their will.
