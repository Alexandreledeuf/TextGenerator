Our Boeing Lot slips through the wincing snow
delivering us back to what we don't quite know
is when or where, but strangely full of purpose:
Poland, a corner soul, the lost mnemonic point
that must be lived and throbbing busily between
a keen about to be what is and would have been,
seductive, snailing forward, justly out of joint:
a spot in time let free for bobbing on the surface,
as we work a frost-bit fall and then again a night
of skill to take it all on our agenda, set it right.
Safe landing on the tarmac gets a grand applause.
Our fellow-passengers awake, blink in a pause
What will a new day bring? We bus back, blitzed
by faddish ads- the half-American bombardments-
loaded with guide-books, aids to Polish grammar
steps up to our shoe-box-size osiedle apartments
into a Warzsawa flashing hoardings of reklama,
fumble in pockets in the dark- the key that fits,
mount the high stairs, summoned by pigeon calls
almost saluting ruinous, graffiti-spangled walls,
find in a stop-start century, competing to be best:
an imperfect present that we put off in The West;
act out the ceremonies we once felt out-of-date:
toast-master speeches, ballroom dancing, kissing
women on the hand, arranging marriages, bowed
weddings, wakes; stand neat in three-piece suit
fill in our flawed jig-saw gist of pieces missing
kitted in long gloves, cut flowers at a roman gate
sparkling in moon-glittered and confetti, snowed
out to unravel the full puzzle picture of our lives.
