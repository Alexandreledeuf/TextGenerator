Hymn For Earning And Imparting Knowledge (Refrain In Aubade)

Deep darkness suppresses all lights
Frightens the existence,
But the fair souls glint
White rays come out,
Gradually white rays turn into red to raise lives around,
Soon the birds start singing,
Trees begin blossoming in breeze
Fragrances spread,
The surroundings call all,
"The sun will rise soon";
Let me get up, o, spouse!
See, enlightened the house;
I need
So much to read!
For learning and earning knowledge
To remove darkness first from me,
Then I should
So much to write! So much to teach! !
For imparting knowledge
To remove darkness from society;
But, sad! So sad!
I have so little time! So little time! !
With so many books! So many works! !
Let my lamenting win,
Let my shedding tears win,
Let me pray to Almighty Allah
For sharpening my brain;
Sharpening my mind;
Sharpening my eyes;
Sharpening my whole life.
