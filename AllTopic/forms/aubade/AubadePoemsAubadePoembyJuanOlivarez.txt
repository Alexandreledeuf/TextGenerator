Mornings are for prayers
And silky rays
of sunshine
Peeking over the mountain range
Mornings are for Jacks
Bounding over the desert sand
And for Coyotes retreating
To the far off hills
Mornings are for doves
Cooing on the telephone wires
And the quail bunched together
Moving their tiny feet impossibly fast
Mornings are for clear blue skies
And the  Santanas scented breezes
Gently moving the leaves on the
Creosote and the Desert Willow
Mornings are a renewal of life
One more chance to make things right
With the maker
Of all things
