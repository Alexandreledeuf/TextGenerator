Here within this cherry grove
all is fragrant, clean and clear
Morning from her belvedere
scatters cherry petals over
freshly minted lawns.
I send my branching thoughts of love
through the petal-vivid air
through the shining cherry grove
over sea and land to where
lay wind-awakened you.
Now when the May with manna shines
upon the gardens and the grass
you cannot help but here them pass
you cannot help but hear my rhymes'
melodious lament.
And I within the cherry grove
will listen in the petal rain
fro home returning thoughts of love
reflected this-away, again
if only it were true
if only it were true.
