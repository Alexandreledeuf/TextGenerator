'Command your ass away,
Get the off and let your soul be gone,
Thy rent is due, find your way,
This by heart and act's not a fun':
The dawn had howled at the dusk,
Who had stayed through skinning the 'phant to it's tusk.
Though indifferent, she wouldn't go.
But a wave devising evil than the East's,
Plucked off all her teeth.- - -
The dawn then mend a blow.
