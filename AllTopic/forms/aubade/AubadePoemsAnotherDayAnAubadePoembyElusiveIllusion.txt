So beautifully you sleep in my dreams today,
But like everyday, the dawn will take you away,
And leave me all alone for yet another day.
So, won't you put the flowers from the bouquet,
Once more, just like the olden days, in your hair,
And let them adorn you, before you go away?
I will live, waiting for another night, another day,
But these flowers will die if you don't stay,
Leave me, but take the flowers with you,
Unlike me, they cannot live without you.
