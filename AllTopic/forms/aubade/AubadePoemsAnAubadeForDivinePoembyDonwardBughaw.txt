You're an awe-inspiring creature
Yea, you Divine whom I adore
The one that I am wishing for
To be my Truelove evermore.
But there are questions in my mind:
'How could we be my dear Divine,
And can you be my valentine? '
Then if you'll say 'no', all is fine.
Aye,
If you Divine would let me live,
With you for hundred thousand years;
There's none a thing I'll never give,
My heart, my love, and truthfulness.
