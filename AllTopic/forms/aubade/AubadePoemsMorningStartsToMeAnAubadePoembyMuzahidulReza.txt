(Aubade Poetry: Morning Starts To Me)
Morning starts to me
With singing the following piece of poetry:
Lots of works ─
I am going through working
How much for me is lotted,
Let my doings be well
As for me so for all;
Huge of foods ─
I am living through eating
How much for me is lotted,
Let my eating be legal
As for me so for my family members all;
Time is advancing
The nature, the earth, the universe are doing;
I am in motion, too
Things are happening,
Let me be on right path
With eternal truth.
