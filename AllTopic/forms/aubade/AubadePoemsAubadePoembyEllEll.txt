As golden flowers; pure and bright
give birth to the sun with gilded light;
and flowing springs in turmoil sway
blossom into the heat of gentle day;
then through the trees, as bluebirds sing
the purpled leaves in breeze they fling.
Rise, rise; yellow waves, arise!
Through cloud and sky, their cupped hands thinned;
yellow waves, arise!
And on the leaves with pearl-dropp gleams
lay tears of the rain like sweet-laid dreams;
as onto morning, from dew stained pond
croak frogs of the green in notes that bond;
then on the trees, as bluebirds shiver
and wind blows loud, the branches quiver.
Rise, rise; yellow waves, arise!
Through cloud and sky, their cupped hands thinned;
yellow waves, arise!
