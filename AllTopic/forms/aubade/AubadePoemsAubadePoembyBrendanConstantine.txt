My love,
you have the right to remain
.......silent. Anything you say
can and will be recorded
.......in my pillow. If you desire,
you may request a transcript
.......of every crushed feather.
You have that right, too.
.......Knowing
and understanding these
.......rights as I sing them,
are you willing to answer
.......without a moon present?
Put your hands in the air
.......and walk toward me.
Tell me what you know.
