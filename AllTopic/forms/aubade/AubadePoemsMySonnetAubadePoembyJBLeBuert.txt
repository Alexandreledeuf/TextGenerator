My song this morning as the sun rises
The gentle breezes wake the songbirds tune
I hope is gentle with no surprises.
Their songbird chirps sweep across the sand dune
The surf continues its endless motion
To our feet encased in the squishy sand
Always bringing evermore the ocean
Life today is more than extremely grand
Sweet memories fading from my old mind
Bringing sweet thoughts and views unfurled just now
Bring a smile to my face as they unwind
Of our life together and yet somehow
The undertow has me and down I go
Never seen again outward I now flow
