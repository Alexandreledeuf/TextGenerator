Darkness submits and day is borne
Shrouded mist engulfs the morn
Stillness echoes through the air
Silence screams beyond compare
Dewdrops crash against the ground
Earths scented smells, so profound
Sunbeams glint from high above
Wisps of cloud fit like a glove
Whispering breeze of senses rife
Unfolding morn, awakens life
