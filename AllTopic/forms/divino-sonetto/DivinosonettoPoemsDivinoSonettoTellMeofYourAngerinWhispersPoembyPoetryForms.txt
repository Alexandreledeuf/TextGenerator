Tell Me of Your Anger in Whispers
A silence is most fine thing when irate.
Emotions can cause words to over state
I ask that first you test your words alone.
If anger stems from blunder of my own
you'll want to be assured your meaning's clear.
If meaning's very clear, then is it fair?
Are these first words intended to repair?
Unleashed, harsh words will travel like a spear.
It's wise of you my dear, therefore, to wait,
for now, until your anger can abate.
If I have stumbled I'll get straight, don't fear.
There's nothing risked delaying words that grate.
My love, use whispers closely late tonight.
I love you, dearly; I will make it right.
