My heart does carry out order is under
My brain, a stout controller, powerful
Had planned a complex project earlier
Sending order to do as potential;
To circulate blood through artery net
Stimulating every tissue active,
To survive the life through exact effort
And to run up to the course is complete;
Since then my heart started doing the task
Pumping via trillions of miles and miles
Of way, narrow, marrow, all chaotic
To defend the life breaking all the piles;
But, life forever will leave my heart, brain
In motionless, finally derailed train.
