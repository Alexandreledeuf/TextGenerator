There's a golden time of honey and rain
A flicker glimpsed on a rare occasion
When you have lightening behind your eyelids
Because your mind is too bright for you to sleep
So a haze of candlelight fills your room
And you watch the autumn pass by outside
Feel the warmth from your soft off-white blanket
While the constellations beckon you near
Have you forgotten what it's like to love
In October that feeling stops right here
Now you are awake when no one else is
