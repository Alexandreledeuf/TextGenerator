When you love nature, its lover you are
Now you do love its things, features, creatures
Birds' songs, blooming flower, running river
Noisy folks, working and normal dwellers;
Harming ignorant, ever helping friend
Thundering cloud, tumultuous crowds' knotting
Far and close; left, right, up, down, forth and hind
You see, hear, feel and smell you are taking;
In summer, winter, in damn and desert
In green and fertile, in grey and barren
On plain, soft land; hard stone and turbulent
Miseries, affluence around you seen,
Simple man of nature in pain and joy
Ever known member with helping envoy.
