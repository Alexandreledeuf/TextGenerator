Iambic Pentameter, Shakespeare’s domain
Writing his fabulous verse in
His verse as delicious as Chinese Lo Mein
Both which I love to immerse in
I never quite knew about metrical feet
Five of which make a pentameter
Iambic’s a word that could make me retreat
Back to my naive parameter
Shakespeare’s deft employment
Of his pent-a-metered guile
Offers much enjoyment
In iam-bi-calic style
