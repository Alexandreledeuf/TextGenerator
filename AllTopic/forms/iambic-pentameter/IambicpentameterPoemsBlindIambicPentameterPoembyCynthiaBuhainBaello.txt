How true that words reveal the heart content,
For from the lips a person does impart
His thoughts, his being, his hidden intent,
All these come from the things stored in the heart.
He so declared that he denies there's God,
Disdains all others who have found true faith.
Presents the many woes in life he had,
That he 'prays' to a Being he negates.
Such contradiction gives us evidence,
Of one whose soul is lost, gripped in Darkness.
No light in there, just the Spirit's absence-
And that explains the claws of Emptiness.
The blind can't discourse on what he can't see.
His vain words would sound like those from a fool.
So vague are his views, understandably
His fate in the end will be.... just dreadful.
