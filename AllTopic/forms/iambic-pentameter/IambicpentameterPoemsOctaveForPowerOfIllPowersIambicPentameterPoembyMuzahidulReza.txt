Octave For Power Of Ill Powers (Iambic Pentameter)
February 1, 2020
Power of ill powers appearing holds
All sources of ultimate corruptions
Including crimes, forgery, cruelty
Wrong doings, hypocrisy, anarchy
Treachery, dictatory, more and more
Which go on forever and forever,
Finally curses, destructions come down
To damn, to damn, to damn and to dire damn.
