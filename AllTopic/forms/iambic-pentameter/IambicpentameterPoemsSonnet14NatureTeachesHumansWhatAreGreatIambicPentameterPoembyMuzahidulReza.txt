Nature teaches humans what are great
And urges to be properly great in mind
High like mountain and sky like vast
Deep like ocean and flat like soil and mud;
To circle around the animal planet like air
To provide necessary elements to animal,
To stretch hands everywhere like water
Without which surviving is impossible;
Nature has been made great consequently
Doing ever fruitful, useful, helpful and nice;
Doing all things and beings room exactly
No want of any element in need and use;
Without nature humans can never survive
Should take natural teachings and archive.
