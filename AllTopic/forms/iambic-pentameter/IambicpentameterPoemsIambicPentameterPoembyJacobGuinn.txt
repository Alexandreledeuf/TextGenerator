You shine in the day and even at night
You light up the world, wherever you roam
You shine in all places, so very bright
Your always on the run, never at home
Why can't you see what you have done to me
You done the unthinkable, left me scarred
I can't explain the pain, just let me be
Leave me alone, even when life gets hard
I struggle through the pain, only for you
To get your attention, is tough enough
You never imagine the things I do
Only for you, but you just make it rough
You don't have a clue, the things that i do
Because i would do anything for you
