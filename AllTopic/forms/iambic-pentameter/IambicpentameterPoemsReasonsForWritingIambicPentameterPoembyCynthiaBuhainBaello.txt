My reasons for writing are so many
Writing's second skin, like breathing to me.
Thoughts and ideas, life lessons I learned,
Woven in words and rhyme,  joy fully earned.
I write not to destroy but to create,
To inspire and uplift some in their faith.
Bring light, perhaps wisdom, and comfort there,
Touch some with a thought that they'll remember.
Writing is God's gift,  to Him I'll answer
Grateful each day He made me a writer!

'But I tell you that everyone will have to give account
on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words
you will be condemned."  (Matthew 12: 36-37)
