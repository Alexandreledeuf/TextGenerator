In each year season changes one after another
Change its color, beauty, smell and ceremony
I pass on and on and more quickly forever;
I pass through winter, summer, cold, hot, rainy
In autumn I see how nature takes a movement!
In spring I see how nature becomes so funny!
In each season nature and its inhabitants get
New arrangement of being, doing and feeling
They usually gain something new and lose old;
Sometimes they praise highly of me well calling
Sometimes sadly they lament and too scold me
I hear them all but usually I have to do nothing;
Day after day and year after year I am only me
Things and beings will go out I have only to see.
