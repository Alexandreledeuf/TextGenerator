Whether things will go normal
Or will happen the occult
But always happens universal
Dirt and dust will simply out,
After day long wind and rain
From fields and farmhouse hay
Then, the night will fall when
Disappears gloomy, weary day;
Myriads stars are in milky way
Some looking at me will hark
My past, my present, anyway
And thus, I will stand in the dark;
Some stars will fall on the ground
And flowers will wither all around.
