Mighty miracles created from wraith-
All it takes is just a little faith;
I have the same, and so very much more-
What then, may I, one fine day, have in store?
I know not with surety, but this much:
Amongst my most ardent desires, as such,
There is an Angel, with which I wish consort-
I pray same-thusly, to Him, I'd exhort:
'I have asked naught of Thee, yet I ask now-
Grant me this one wish, I need not ask how
Or why You'd proffer this Angel to me,
Only that You help this Angel, to see
The Truth in her own heart, and that in mine:
A Truth our hearts may no longer confine! '
