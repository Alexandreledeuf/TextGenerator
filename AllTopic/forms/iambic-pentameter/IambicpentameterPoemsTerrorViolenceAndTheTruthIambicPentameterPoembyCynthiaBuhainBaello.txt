Terror, Violence, and The Truth
The root cause of Terror is simply Hate,
The lust to control the world with Power.
Denial of this fact will not negate
Its existence, its evident goal there.
Tendrils of this movement we know now reach
Seats of power and might in government.
Truth is so blurred as they dictate and preach
Their beliefs as peaceful,  not violent.
Yet by actions any faith is made true
Their beliefs are proven.... by what they do.
