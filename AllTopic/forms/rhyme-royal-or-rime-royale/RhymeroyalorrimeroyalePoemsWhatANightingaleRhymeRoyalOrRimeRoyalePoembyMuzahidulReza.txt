What a nightingale!
How sweetly it sings!
On our earth for all,
Guess what it means
That sings all the times,
Knows no any hinder
Full voice it does clear;
Suddenly you do call
'Heavenly Nightingale!
You are so wonderful,
In singing, size, color, all
Your life is successful;
Among mortal we are'
Heavenly bird you are!
