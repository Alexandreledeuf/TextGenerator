(Rhyme Royal Or Rime Royale - 9)
Then, many times I have passed this area
Many times I have smelled yellow flowers
Many times I have heard the *papia,
In shivering cool, mists, fogs of winter
Looks stagnant, paralyzed and languor;
I have seen human comforted in haze
In the dead wintry nature of numbness.
