Land of bliss is where full of heavenly virtues
A paradise to its inhabitants
Full of plants, flowers and fruits
Spot of comfort, happiness and peace,
Love floods this land everywhere
All chaos, vices, misdeeds washes away
Rubbishes, trashes, refuses are nowhere
Lives filled up with blisses and sway,
Peace loving happy people live here
Cultivate all virtues and well products,
My goodness! Direct me to be there
To set life with virtues-producing equipments.
