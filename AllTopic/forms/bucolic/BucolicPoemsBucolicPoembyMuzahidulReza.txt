The sun is for light
Light at whole arcady
The whole periphery
At day flees the dark,
The farmers work in the fields
In union
No fight, hatred, envy, enmity
They are friends, neighbors
Sisters, brothers;
At night moon shines
No dark,
At dark night
Flush the lightning bugs
Whole countryside laughs,
In the bush foxes bark
Chase them the dogs;
The night breaks
By crowing of the cocks.
