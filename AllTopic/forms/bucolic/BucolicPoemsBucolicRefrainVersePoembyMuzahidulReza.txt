In cowshed farm
All day goes charm,
Early in the morning they get up
After breakfast
All are out of shed
Some tend
Some care
Some feed
Some milk
Some process milk
Some go to sell
Some go to count money;
In cowshed farm
All day goes charm,
After separately taking lunch
And after a short rest
Works again they star
Till evening they stay in field
The red sun having set
All the charms enter the shed.
