Her body is a melting pot
On the silken sheet
with pillow beneath
trying hard to hold spinning head
temperature falling
heartbeat rising
body heat ignites the fumes
smell of love
in the air and everywhere
my wishes spiral bind the body and mind
hairs like desert of vast eternity
with dunes of desires
silken arms making waves and
despair was meager to obliterate
yearning to slurp those juicy lips
yet he dare not to ignite mutual flames.
