These carefree spirits,
thrive on the weak minds
Who falls prey to superstition,
they believe in.
Ah, these poor chaps,
they know not,
That these so called saints,
will suck their blood,
And will take them to task,
by creating smoke screens,
And will make life miserable,
making return uphill task,
And till the time they live,
will serve as unpaid slaves,
Do not follow them blindly,
Into a tunnel which has no lights.
