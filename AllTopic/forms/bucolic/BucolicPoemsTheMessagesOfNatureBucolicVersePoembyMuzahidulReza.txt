The surroundings are
Air, water, beings, things,
Gathering together
They form our expected nature,
It is empowered
To produce the necessary
For all the beings
And arranging all the things,
It is wonderful,
Suitable, vast and grand
Enough to contain all
That everything to be available,
Also rough and hard
So to know it is quite tough,
Needed contemplation
More and more meditation,
It is obviously
Has been a great source
Of the knowledge
We learn in school and college,
But the messages all
Of nature are clearly written
On lots of unseen pages
Are seen only by the real wises,
It is also more
To pen a wide window
For thinking about creatures,
God and the entire universe,
The nature is actually
Has been a great teacher
To teach us manners,
Orders, aims with features,
The best is that
Desire something for life
For lessons from nature
To develop life more and more,
Take a leave
Sometimes for life mainly
To make a tour
Through the significant nature.
