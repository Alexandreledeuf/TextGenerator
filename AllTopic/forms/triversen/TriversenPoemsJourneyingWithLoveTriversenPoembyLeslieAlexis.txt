Your smile silently swayed me its way;
My head guided by your voluptuous pull,
My days and nights passed as a blur.
We traversed many a raging river,
Whose waters flooded the feet that followed,
But I never noticed the wetness.
We climbed till we were in the clouds;
We maneuvered massive mountains,
But I am yet to see a hill.
We journeyed to hell-hot deserts,
Where life left with children and the bag,
But I am yet to feel the heat.
We dived to the darkest of oceans
Where the only lights were our hearts,
But love always lit the way.
I find peace in the green of your eyes.
The love that blooms, that I see in them,
Takes my worries, erases my pain.
