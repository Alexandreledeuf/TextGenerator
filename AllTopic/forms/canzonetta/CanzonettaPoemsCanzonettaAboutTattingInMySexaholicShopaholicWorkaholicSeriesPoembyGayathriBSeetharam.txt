Canzonetta about tatting in my Sexaholic Shopaholic Workaholic series
-Gayathri B. Seetharam
The canzonetta follows the rhyme scheme ababcdcD; efefgdgD and is in the form of two octaves made up of a quatrain of alternating rhyme (Poetry Forms) .
As with the abstract concept of Plato's Theory of Forms, the Sexaholic in me takes on an artistic self also
I end up exploring beatific forms of creative expression
These please the aesthetic self in me as well
I have done painting, batik, embroidery, crochet, etc
And if tatting clicks in me
I shall cajole the DICK - Daring Intense Creative Keenness into my presence
If the Shopaholic in me says that testing out the Crick and Watson double helical structure of DNA is in the horizon with single strands of DNA
I am glad that watching the entertaining TV children's show, Life with Derek, days are over for both my son and I;
I belong to the tatting elite because I have 2 shuttles, a picot gauge and tatting needles
It is going to be quite the feat to make my son's name and a flower
I shall become the erudite in tatting for there are no alphabets in my design book or helpful Pinterest images
And I am going to have a fete tatting away
My design shall have the definition of a poetical technique in Poets Garrett
I am reminded of the date I had earlier this summer for a night and a day embroidering with the needle and thread
I had a positive ball for I had a great time
And I must add that unlike ladies like Dwight Eisenhower's mother who had seven sons, I have the drive and energy to engage in hair brained projects.
