There once was a lonely banana
pretty ugly but otherwise sana.
Poet Allan came by
dressed it up on the sly
the banana then wore a bandana.
Do you know why bananas aren't straight?
They would never fit into a crate.
And when eaten in haste
for their wonderful taste
they'll go down, slightly bent, to their fate.
Each banana here has its own bender
they are twisted according to gender.
if a straight one slips through
it's the evening crew
and it always goes back to the sender.
