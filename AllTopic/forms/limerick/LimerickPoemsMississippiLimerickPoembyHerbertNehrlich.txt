On the raft down the Mississippi
were the wife and her husband Hippie.
When they brought back the melons
from the striped, shackled felons
they  soon sank and the water was nippy.
But they had, for the voyage, prepared
and that is why both of them fared
rather well in the end
and this limerick was penned
so the story could truly be shared.
