Beauty in a thing is beautiful thing,
Beauty in a being is beautiful being;
Purity is of same kind
It touches a thing or being
Thing and being are pure
Reflected on mirror;
It touches a soul
Rays spread around the soul
Look for soul mates
The soul mates are pure and good;
The rays also reflect on me
So I try to write good renga, rhyme
Nonet, sonnet, etc. and
Palindrome or mirror poetry.
