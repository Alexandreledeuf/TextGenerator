The victorious instantly mirror in lots of minds
As heroes,
But what my palindrome or mirror poetry mirrors
From ancient to present
The victorious mirror villains
Or valiants
Or even both, in fact;
The victorious take part in strife
Then strive
May be legally
Or, illegally
While gaining victory
Things, beings they ruin
And in no case they can form any, again.
