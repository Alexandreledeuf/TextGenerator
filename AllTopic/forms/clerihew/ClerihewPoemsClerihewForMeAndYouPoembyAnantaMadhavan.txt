A schoolboy called Edmund Clerihew
Bentley, as known to a very few
Lovers of English, began a century ago the fad of biography
In four lines and two rhymes, a sort of verse photography.
If asked why we ignore the surname Bentley,
I would reply ignorantly or innocently,
That what young Edmund innovated was levity
In finding rhymes to fit the four-line brevity.

Written when I remembered the popular verse:
John Stuart Mill,
By a mighty effort of will,
Overcame his natural bonhomie
And wrote ‘Principles of Political Economy’.
