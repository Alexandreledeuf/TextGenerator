Busta Sonetto about the sensual aspects of my personality in my Sexaholic Shopaholic Workaholic series
-Gayathri B. Seetharam
A Busta Sonetto has 2 quintets and a quatrain (Poets Garrett) .
As a Sexaholic, it saddens me that it is illegal to pay or solicit money for good old fashioned sex
Going back in time, I employed a male escort for $350 in Summer 2013
For in the style of my talk during my graduate school days in chem/biochem/biomed eng. or as in Jackie Collins books
Paid sex forces your partner, Ladies, into a definite outcome for you
But me darling, my husband, it was and is always good and at times, fantastic sex;
As a Shopaholic, three summers ago, I picked up 10 Trojan condoms
Along with replacements for artificial flowers for the tall vase in our foyer
And other knick knacks and bric-a-brac
Alas! I did not use any of these condoms for after that, it has not been sex in the Deep Sea
But only in the general vicinity;
As a Workaholic, I, on International Women's Day 2018, submitted an e-Bill
To the Canadian Parliament for approval
And my request was the inclusion of heterosexual men's pornographic material in NOW magazine which is discriminatory towards feminist women
My reasoning being that on picturing the male organ or sexual intercourse between heterosexuals, one can during the act of masturbation, reach a complete orgasm as a full blooded woman.
