Teaches and trains even the worst pupil
Ever ready to help the student in troubled times
Allows students to nurture their talents
Chides and punishes justly
Held in high esteem
Exemplary and encouraging
Remembers the pupil, forgets the name
’Selflessly serves society to the best of his/ her ability
Defends the weaker students against the robust
Advises appropriately
Yields to the highly intelligent student
