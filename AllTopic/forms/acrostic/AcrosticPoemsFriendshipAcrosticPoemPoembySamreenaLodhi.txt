From the departure of all worries
Refreshing beams from a source
In a new way with a bloom
Every passing moment is with this
No more troubles and no more pain
Destined for this path only to gain
Sailing through the winds on this thread
Hiking through the perils of this world
It's a relationship with your friends
Passage and shelter, from all trends
