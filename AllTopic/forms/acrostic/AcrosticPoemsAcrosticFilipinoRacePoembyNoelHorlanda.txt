An acrostic (from the late Greek akróstichis, from ákros, 'top', and stíchos, 'verse')  is a poem or other form of writing in an alphabetic script, in which the first letter, syllable or word of each line, paragraph or other recurring feature in the text spells out a word or a message.
Far down South China Sea
Indigenous brave men and women lives
Loyal, friendly, fearless happy people
Ingenious and not to be outsmarted
Pearl of the orient no other else in Asia
Islands nurtured by Mother Nature and its wonders
Not to fear surrender its freedom and liberty
Only to die and ready to struggle to self-determination
Race to economic prosperity
Ace of democracy and ingenuity
Challenges to fight back in defense of its sovereignty
Echoes people power through out the world
