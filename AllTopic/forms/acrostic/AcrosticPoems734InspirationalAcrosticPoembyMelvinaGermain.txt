In the landscape of your mind, one has the ability to think clearly.
Never allowing deep, dark thoughts to penetrate.
Spirited, beautiful and heavenly thoughts tickle the senses.
Piercing through delicate walls,  giving strength to stand  tall.
Instead of accepting negative views from those of low self esteem.
Realize you are in charge of every thought held within.
Always start each day in a positive light.
Thinking, of God’s wondrous gifts, His beauty in sight.
In the quiet of the noon day sun,   a new day has begun.
On top of  mountains high, sitting calmly while  birds fly by.
Never leaving  your mind untouched by God’s beauty.
Always covered like a glove,  by the blood of the lamb.
Live, love, laugh stay protected, in the palm of His glorious hand.
