Every decision that we make is never perfect,
the Drive to be perfect is a bold resolution.
while MOst often we think we are correct,
yet Unluckily something can go wrong.
its Not  the mistake we made that is at stake,
but the Decorum we practice is what counts most
for Only God is perfect and not us humans!
