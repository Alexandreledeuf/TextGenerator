Almost never found,
But gorgeous at first sight,
Seen from a point of view almost no one has,
Obscure to the common sight,
Luxurious to those who accomplish it,
Utterly perpetuous for those who conserve it,
Tender enough to appreciate and an,
Extraordinary experience.
Loving to the outer most passion,
Of no absolute return,
Vulnerable at most, but,
Eternal when at its best.
