Love is like the damask rose
Once smitten, bound by its charm
Vividly feeling nature so close
Every moment makes feelings warm
Learn about being a better thyself
Essence of love shall make you fonder
As the flower enriches the world, it enriches itself
Deeply touched by its wonder
Nurtured scent of the damask fills the air
Acutely mesmerising mind, heart and soul
The sweetness that pulls those with the flair
Ultimate pure happiness without any foul
Relish the true beauty of divine nature
Earthy wonders lead to blissful future.
