Everyone should care.
No one should ignore a world so
Vital and green;
Inviting and teeming with life. Mother earth
Revolves around our respect, how we take
Ownership of our actions; and
Never forget our inheritance. We must
Mind our responsibility and pass along
Every moment of beauty bestowed upon us;
Nurture a green future for our children, and
Try to preserve Mother Nature's gift to us all.
