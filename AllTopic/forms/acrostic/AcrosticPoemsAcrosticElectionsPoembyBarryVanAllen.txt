Best left to each one's conscience,
Entertain it if you must,
The explanation's never clear,
To me it isn't either,
Except on rare occasions when,
Rust is sloughing off  of us.
Nothing is forever,
OR everything goes ' round again,
The explanation's never clear.
To me it isn't either,
Only now,  I realize.
As morons say those things,
Stupidity my well elect, our next acting,
King!
