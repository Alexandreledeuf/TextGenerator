Mountainous terrain steep
In the Tibetan plateau, where the
Sky almost
Touches the horizon
Yonder, with the
Mist moving up from the vale below,
Over the tall pine-trees and thick foliage,
Uniting the clouds from above
Naturally, and blocking the visual acuity of
The tired, trekking mountaineers on their
Arduous route down the mountain slopes,
In the intense heat of the rising sun,
Notwithstanding the many
Miles of shrubs and undergrowth that lie ahead, looking
Impossible to even the expert climber, who is momentarily
Relieved and excited by the mirage of an old castle
Appearing suddenly from nowhere,
Giving a ‘de ja vu’ feeling to all up there
Eyeing the beauty of the ancient masonry.
