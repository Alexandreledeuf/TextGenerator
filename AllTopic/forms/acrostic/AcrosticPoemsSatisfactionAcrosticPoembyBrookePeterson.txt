Say you'll never leave me.
All my life be true.
Trust is the question.
Intuition is the answer.
Someday you promise.
Fun isn't the same to me.
Acting verses doing.
Cut straight to the chase.
Time is flying by.
Incomplete isn't good enough.
Only you and I can see.
Never is when, Satisfied I will be.
