Kindles my heart with love
enthuse my soul with ecstasy
zealous adoration inspires me
influx of fantasy fills my thoughts
as you capture my whole being
how I wish I can win your love too
Amor is love
many dream of
on finding it right
rare true love comes
Soon I shall have courage
and ready to court you
love for me is timing
confident and true
ever patience
daring action
on right time
