He gave forgiveness for all who repent
In His great Mercy paid it all at Calvary
Sacrificed so perfect,  Grace touched you and me.
How can one receive the Gift so pure?
Each one can take it from His Word
All who turn away from sin are sure
Love and peace His Grace pours forth
In all of that He reigns as LORD
New creations only He can promise
God is Faithful and He will do this.
God gives new life as you turn to Him
Restoration and healing He alone can give
Almighty and eternal is your God within
Christ said you will not perish but eternally live.
Everything God said is true...so believe!
