Writing's a tonic, yes, indeed!
Relaxing to the mind!
In times of stress, in times of need,
To help you to unwind!
In truth, the pen is mightier!
No doubt at all in this...
God knows our meanings must be clear
Succinct won't go amiss!
A gentle word, a piece of prose,
Triumphant themes and more,
Opinions sought, meant to propose,
Not easy to ignore!
I've done my part, this much is true...
Calligraphy's now up to YOU!
