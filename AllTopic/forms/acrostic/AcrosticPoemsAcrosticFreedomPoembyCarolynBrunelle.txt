F orever it flies over the halls of justice;
R evered as beloved symbol across the land
E very heart feels humbled by her anthem.
E ach pledge made beneath her liberty and
D ream fulfilled in her history is part of her glory.
O ver her adoring people she waves her colors,
M y country's flag from sea to shining sea.
