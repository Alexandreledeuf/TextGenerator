Resurrect this corpse with the shade of dying Crimson
Enter each dropp at the will of my own forsaken hand
Undo nothing for blood shall reunite us two
Nothing stands in the way of what Crimson wants
Indefinite screams I hear from the grave, Beckon me
Onto the bloody alter
Never shall this crimson vein close.
Often I shall  reminisce on my sacrificial love,
For you my dear, hold what simple Crimson cannot.
Bathe in my words My veins unwillingly leak,
Let all of me course within your body
Ounce by ounce our blood collides
Often messy, watch this bloody tide,
Death shall visit one last time, to join in this reunion of Blood.
