Deep in the darkest part of your heart
Every beat seems to be a trying slow start
Pride and victory have no place here
Reasonable thoughts are placed on the back burner
Every breath  difficult and heavy
Seasons all remain the same, cold, dark and gloomy
Stereotypical behaviour is quite apparent
In the quiet darkness you reside
On a deep running  slow train
Never, yes it never seems like youâ€™ll come back again
