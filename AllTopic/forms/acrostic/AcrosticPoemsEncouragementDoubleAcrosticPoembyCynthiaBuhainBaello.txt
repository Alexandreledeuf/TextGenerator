Each new day is a rare chance at LifE
Not merely an accident, lightly takeN.
Considering death is our cul de saC
Obviously our Fate, that's eventually sO.
Use each moment then to bless all round yoU
Remember on earth, you won't stay foreveR.
Always bring Kindness as a sort of mannA
Grace your words with love as a blessinG.
Every moment holds opportunity therE
Many are hurting, with words you can touch theM.
Even across miles,  Goodness knows no fencE,
Now is the time for Man's care to be giveN.
Truly as the night comes, you sleep in contentmenT.
