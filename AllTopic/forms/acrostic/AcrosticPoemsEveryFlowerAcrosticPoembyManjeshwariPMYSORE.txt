Every flower that blooms withers
Very true is the tale,
Even the brightest and the pale;
Rich in softness, fragrance, beauty and colors
Yet they give out pleasure to others
Fresher they bloom, duller they wither;
Look at their wonderful journey
Only once they bloom, yet they live on
Within the minds of all, as recollection
Even after many years, as honey
Rightly are they GOD's best creation!
