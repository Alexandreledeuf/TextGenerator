You love your motherland –
One, where you were born and nurtured in
Unknown ways, most miraculously.
Love your Motherland with heart and soul;
Only your own country is the safest for you;
View its landscape, gorgeous and beautiful;
Every fellowman is your brethren.
You must be proud of its rich heritage;
One shouldn’t forget how freedom was got;
Unite against forces that separate;
Repay your country’s love by sacrifice.
May be, your country is not very rich;
Only its culture is so remarkable;
Traditions must be followed with pride;
Honor your national flag;
Every citizen is duty-bound;
Religions shouldn’t serve to foment fights;
Love the soil that feeds you all through life;
Astound the world by your patriotism;
Nothing’s more sacred and valuable than your Motherland;
Die, if need be, for your country’s sake!
