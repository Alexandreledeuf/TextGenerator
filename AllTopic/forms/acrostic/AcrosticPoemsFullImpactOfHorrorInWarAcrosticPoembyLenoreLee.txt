Functioning is difficult when in shock
Untimely end has come for all
Lack of food
Lack of hope
I see no bravery only fear, only pain
Men kill, men die
People struggle to survive
Aid is needed everywhere
Courage is needed in the hopeless
Time passes slowly, too slow
Outside is unsafe
Families are blown apart
Honour is all we have left
Obvious pain shows on all faces
Rich and poor people suffer the same
Running away has become normal
Our lives are destroyed
Ruin has commenced
