Kill me with soft words of love
Irritate both fate and death,
Love Crimson, by killing all she is,
Let love be, but hate with all her passions.
Martyr that of thyne heart
Eat away at every scarred part.
Gorge on the feast I have provided
Eat like a king, you shall behead me the same,
Not all can be loved, but your passionate kill shows the most passion,
Toy with me, my death is evident, yet theres no murder
Let me die quickly as to not suffer your passions anymore,
You finally did it, you killed me with your nothings.
