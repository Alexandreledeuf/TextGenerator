J ust as the old year ends the new begins,
A nd once again the countdown is in motion.
N ow we can say goodbye to last yearâ€™s sins,
U plifted hearts set out on this new ocean.
A las, our resolution may soon fail
(R elentless life is so full of commotion)
Y et full of hope we willingly set sail.
