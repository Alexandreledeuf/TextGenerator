Captivated, by your love and charms. I shall always be.
~~ Can't wait to hold you in my arms. You are everything to me.
Always there, you are on my mind and deep within my heart.
~~ Always knew that I needed you. Right from the very start.
Pretty as a picture, you are a vision of loveliness.
~~ Pleasing is this gift of love, that we now possess.
Tears of joy you bring to me. With each passing day.
~~ Tears '' only of happiness '' are all that flow my way.
In every waking moment. I find that you are always on my mind.
~~ In every way I am thankful, for our love that's so divine.
Virtually our love has blossomed, fulfilling my every need.
~~ Viable is how our love has grown, from the smallest seed.
All of heavens stars shine down, upon the wonder of our love.
~~ All love's treasure beyond measure. 'Twas sent from up above.
The love we have grown. This love we now own, it shall always stay.
~~These feelings that I feel today, shall never go away.
Every time I hold you in my arms. I know that our love is true.
~~ Each breath that I take asleep or awake, 'tis for only you.
Darling listen to me as I hold you in my arms. It's you that I adore!
~~ Deeply; I am captivated by your love and will be - for evermore...
