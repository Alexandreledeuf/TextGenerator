Unexpected is this strange transition,
K.G.B. and C.I.A. destroyed, -
Remnants of a world which once enjoyed
A game of catch as catch can coalition.
Idea[l]s are bent beyond all recognition,
New capital’s towards the East decoyed,
Enterprise unbridled, unalloyed:
Uncertain is Man’s future, world in fission.
Kiev opportunity:  ambition
Rises with the rate that unemployed
Are added to the rolls.  Few will avoid
Impending challenge, fewer have volition.
Now, with the New Year knocking on the door,
Expect in time change none have dreamed before.
