Forced “progress’” pace, accelerating years
Race onwards, spiral with increasing speed,
Each chasing each proclaiming global need,
Exhorting freedom shatter terror's tears,
Enjoying well earned triumph.  Changing gears
Now merge and surge impelled by subprime greed.
To tipping point for health, to which succeed
Epidemics global.  Each man fears
Rising floods as arctic ice-cap nears
Precocious end.  Beliefs begin to bleed,
Regions suffer climatic threats which feed
Insider dealing, trust, bear disappears.
Seek Eden far from mortgaged madding crowd,
Enjoy simplicity with heart unbowed...
