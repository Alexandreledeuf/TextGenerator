Real deal donâ€™t simply come through,
Only a zealous act can make it true.
Can not cease on one or two successes,
Heed to what your innate desire focuses.
Expend all the opportunities at hand,
Let your candid charm grabs it all with fond.
Life is an open arena for whatever you yearn,
Every victory you get is worth the train.
Onward to venture and accomplish more,
Conquer boundaries while you explore.
Our support for you bear no bore.
