Pressures, hassles gone
restless hours are done
on this retirement day
memories will always stay
in time I now got freedom
draws no fear of boredom
as a single blessed woman
Tomorrow remains unforeseen
over the years still dreamin'
right now my time has come
never again I feel lonesome
onwards my life be awesome
