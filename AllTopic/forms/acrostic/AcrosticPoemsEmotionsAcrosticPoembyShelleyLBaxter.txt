Boiling over with sudden extreme Anger
Only wondering not really knowing
I only suspect dishonesty
Letting my suspicions take hold of me
I prepare for my plan of attack
Not knowing where my questions will lead
Going to a private hell where trust is out of reach
Overly hurt and utterly disgusted
Very sickening feelings flood my mind.
Every thing I thought I knew, I now question
Ready to give up and say enough is enough!
