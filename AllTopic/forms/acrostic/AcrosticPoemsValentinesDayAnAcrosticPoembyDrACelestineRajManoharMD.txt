Victory to all hearts at love;
Amazing words of love exchange;
Love fills the air everywhere;
E-mails sent in lovely hues and tones of love;
No one’s exempt from love’s phenomenon;
The whole world celebrates ‘lover’s day, ’
In gaiety, romanticism and togetherness;
No one need covet persons at love;
Every person needs a lovely time;
’
Say, ‘I love you’ to someone, if you can.
Dance and sing to tunes of love;
Awaken emotions in Cupid’s style;
You are a valentine on earth to someone!
