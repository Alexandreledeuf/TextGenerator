Merlin, magician, foresight filled,
Extending sight beyond the seas
Reigns saw which rose to heights that tease
Low saw them sink, their promise stilled.
Is this life’s prophecy fulfilled
None should contest though soon veins freeze?
Time is too short, and stiff the fees
Offered, taken, - ambitions killed.
Mermaid made blood melt, then chilled
Enthusiastic energies
Removed all barriers to please
Mind, body, soul, seduction skilled.
Across life’s net thoughts intertwine
IDeas, identities, combine...
