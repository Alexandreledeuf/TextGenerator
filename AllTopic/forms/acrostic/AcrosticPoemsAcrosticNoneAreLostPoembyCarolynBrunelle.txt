N one of us are who we think we are.
O nly those sheeple who follow blindly
N ecessitate great introspection, cruel judgement.
E veryone is on equal ground.
A ll fall short, soon evolve and are elevated.
R espect should be given to each man so that
E ach soul is allowed to grow and flourish;
L earn to be a part of the whole.
O nly those of limited vision see men perish
S tripped of beauty and angel wing;
T is only earthly eyes that envision such things.
