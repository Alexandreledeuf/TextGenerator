O Valentine, my love, will you be mine,
Become my loving sweetheart that we may
Entwine like twisting vine or eglantine,
More closely grow together every day?
You ask me why I love you as I do,
Vain would it be were I to try to list
All thousand things that make you specially you:
Lips like twin lotus buds just made to kiss,
Eyes clear and still like pools in which I lose
No time but dive within to sink or swim,
To lose all sense of time and place. I choose
In tenderness to meet your every whim,
No matter what you wish Iâ€™ll gladly do
Except give up, or go, or be untrue.
