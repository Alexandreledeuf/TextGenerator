I will stand by you until; the sands of time, stand still -
Without you my world would just crumble and fade away
It is heaven when I hold you, each embrace is such a thrill
Lost in thoughts of you, your on my mind both night and day
Love like ours I am thankful for and I pray our love will stay
Standing by your side I shall, in sunshine or in rain
Through my life '' I will stand by you '' there I shall remain
As our love grows, like the pretty flowers do in spring
Never ending perfumed bouquets of love, to you I'll bring
Divine is our romance, to me your love means everything
Being with you my angel, I've shed only happy tears
Your loves a part of me, that I'll treasure through the years
You are all I ever longed for my paradise of dreams, it seems
Only your love could bring this all about. I will stand by you
Until the last grain of sand, in the hourglass of time runs out
