Man of legendary talent who
inspires humanity to unite  and
congregates a million fans through
his magnetic songs that simplify
a thousand sentiments of humanity
exposing a multitude diversities
languishing  in  vague controversies
Just a human being who succumbed to
a lot of adversities in life just like anybody
continuing to survive  by  fighting  the odds
kicking ass to assert  certain  innate rights
so that freedom may prevail in own self
over and above giving joy to others
now has come to an end in death
