I Did Not Mean To Offend You
I Say This With Regret
I Have The Highest Regard For You
… Admire With Deep Respect
I Would Never Insult You
Or Belittle, Or Upset
Not Knowingly, Nor Callously
My Affection and You … Have Met
So, If Our Paths Cross, or Get Lost
Please Forgive, If You Can’t Forget
For The Words Of Your Soul (Now Silent and Cold)
Still Haunt Me … Even Yet …
