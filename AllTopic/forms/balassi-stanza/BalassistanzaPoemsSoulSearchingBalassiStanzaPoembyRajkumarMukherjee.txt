Soul Searching- Balassi Stanza
Soul was searching his mate,
from life to life in haste,
unable to find him close-
he decided to end,
his own life and amend,
path of journey to recourse;
never-felt-idea soot,
ending life is no good,
cowards fall in prey, remorse.
Life's course is all destined,
start and end, determined,
why to disturb the path, chain?
Live life to full extent,
be kind and heart's content,
share your love and not your pain.
Soul will find his soulmate,
be in this life or next;
have belief in His domain.
