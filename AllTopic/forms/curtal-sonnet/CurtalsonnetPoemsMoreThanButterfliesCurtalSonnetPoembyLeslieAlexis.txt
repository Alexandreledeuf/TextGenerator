Those are not mere butterflies that we feel.
Only if their wings span the universe
Could this be; our love is awfully strong!
Like diamonds or unbreakable steel,
And in its center lays the two of us,
Nested in a meadow, singing love’s song.
Love, you like no other can, complete me.
Butterflies do little; we have a plus:
An explosive force that takes us along,
And all of its ways and signs show that we
Belong.
