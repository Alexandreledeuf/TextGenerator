I’m shod in black and silver sandals; slippery
-soled. A gentleman extends a hand;
we rock ‘n roll. A waltz is next but I’m
perplexed and so are my feet. The music skips;
I’m counting triple-duple beats. Outlandish
rhythm; out of step and out of rhyme.
Still, I like the song. The bagatelle
has five beat bars; I hum along. How finely
shines the diamante night by candle
-light. Only you can dance this well
Quintuple Time.
