It's dark, we're playing hide and seek and shy
you are and water-wrapped and sly I be.
And I can smell your scent - metallic, chthonic
and I can see a flash of lidded eyes
like bashful moons and I can feel you pleat
the pond and make the rushes shiver, ‘…PLONK…'
and I can want your pulse and skittish bones
and filmy skin and seep to slip between
my scaly lip and sweet frissons will throng
inside my throat from all your twiggy toes.
I love you Pogglebonk.
