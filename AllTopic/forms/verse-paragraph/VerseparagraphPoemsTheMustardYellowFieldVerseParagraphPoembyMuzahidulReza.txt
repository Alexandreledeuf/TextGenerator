Covering their locality like white curtains,
Chilly mists and fogs attract all the rural folks,
They go near mustard field to fell down the dew drops

They do it that the plants get light and heat
In the morning sun and can grow well soon;
In the morning when the sun is seen

Soon the farmers harvest the ripe mustard crops
Threshing the ripe plants they prepare the seeds.
