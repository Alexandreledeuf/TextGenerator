Verse Paragraph On Green Chili
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Green chilies from green leafstalk and small white flower
When come out seem to be lots of small green sticks
Will pierce all that are in front,
These are full of vitamin C and other food value
Bring real flavor in food offering excellent taste,
The farmers cultivate these in soft soil with tender care
People take the taste these year round,
If you have not tasted have missed something much,
Sometimes, your doctor prescribes it
Especially in winter chilly cold.
