My Country Bangladesh
From 20°34˝ north latitude to 26°38˝ north latitude
And from88°01˝ east longitude to 92°41˝ east longitude,
The physical geography of Bangladesh is varied
And has an area characterized by two distinctive features:
A broad deltaic plain subject to frequent flooding
And a small hilly region crossed by swiftly flowing rivers
The country has an area of 147,610 square kilometers
And extends 820 kilometers north to south
And 600 kilometers east to west
Bangladesh is bordered on the west, north, and east
By a 4,095-kilometer land frontier with India
And in the southeast
By a short land and water frontier (193 km)
With Burma (Myanmar)
On the south is a highly irregular deltaic coastline
Of about 580 kilometers,
Fissured by many rivers and streams
Flowing into the Bay of Bengal
The territorial waters of Bangladesh extend
Twelve (12)nautical miles (22 km) ,
And the exclusive economic zone of the country
Is 200 nautical miles (370 km):
Bangladesh is a low-lying, riverine country
Located in South Asia with a largely marshy jungle
The coastline of 710 km (441 mi)
On the northern littoral of the Bay of Bengal
Formed by a delta plain at the confluence of the Ganges (Padma) ,
Brahmaputra (Jamuna) , and Meghna Rivers and their tributaries,
Bangladesh's alluvial soil is highly fertile,
But vulnerable to flood and drought
Hills rise above the plain
Only in the Chittagong Hill Tracts
In the far southeast and the Sylhet division in the northeast
Straddling the Tropic of Cancer,
Bangladesh has a tropical monsoon climate
Characterized by heavy seasonal rainfall,
High temperatures, and high humidity
Natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes,
And tidal bores affect the country yearly
Bangladesh also is affected by major cyclones,
On average 16 times a decade;
Almost 80% of the landmass is made up of fertile alluvial lowland
called the Bangladesh Plain
The plain is part of the larger Plain of Bengal,
Which is sometimes called the Lower Gangetic Plain
Although altitudes up to 105 meters
Above sea level occur in the northern part of the plain,
Most elevations are less than 10 meters above sea level;
Elevations decrease in the coastal south,
Where the terrain is generally at sea level
With such low elevations and numerous rivers,
Water—and concomitant flooding—is a predominant physical feature
About 10,000 square kilometers
Of the total area of Bangladesh is covered with water,
And larger areas are routinely flooded during the monsoon season;
Bangladesh has a tropical monsoon climate
Characterized by wide seasonal variations in rainfall,
High temperatures, and high humidity
Regional climatic differences in this flat country are minor
Three seasons are generally recognized:
A hot, muggy summer from March to June; a hot, humid
And rainy monsoon season from June to November;
And a warm-hot, dry winter from December to February
In general, maximum summer temperatures range
Between 38 and 41 °C (100.4 and 105.8 °F)
April is the hottest month in most parts of the country
January is the coolest month,
When the average temperature for most of the country
Is 16-20 °C (61-68 °F)during the day
And around 10 °C (50 °F)at night;
Winds are mostly from the north and northwest in the winter,
Blowing gently at 1 to 3 kilometers per hour (0.6 to 1.9 mph)
In northern and central areas
And 3 to 6 kilometers per hour (1.9 to 3.7 mph)near the coast
From March to May, violent thunderstorms,
Called northwesters by local English speakers,
Produce winds of up to 60 kilometers per hour (37.3 mph)
During the intense storms of the early summer
And late monsoon season,
Southerly winds
Of more than 160 kilometers per hour (99.4 mph)
Cause waves to crest as high as 6 meters (19.7 ft)
In the Bay of Bengal,
Which brings disastrous flooding to coastal areas;
Heavy rainfall is characteristic of Bangladesh
Causing it to flood every year
With the exception
Of the relatively dry western region of Rajshahi,
Where the annual rainfall is about 1,600 mm (63.0 in) ,
Most parts of the country receive
At least 2,300 mm (90.6 in)of rainfall per year
Because of its location
Just south of the foothills of the Himalayas,
Where monsoon winds turn west and northwest,
The region of Sylhet
In northeastern Bangladesh receives
The greatest average precipitation;
About 80% of Bangladesh's rain falls during the monsoon season
The monsoons result from the contrasts between low
And high air pressure areas
That result from differential heating of land and water
During the hot months of April and May
Hot air rises over the Indian subcontinent,
Creating low-pressure areas into which rush cooler,
Moisture-bearing winds from the Indian Ocean
This is the southwest monsoon,
Commencing in June and usually lasting through September
Dividing against the Indian landmass,
The monsoon flows in two branches,
One of which strikes western India
The other travels up the Bay of Bengal
And over eastern India and Bangladesh,
Crossing the plain to the north and northeast
Before being turned to the west and northwest
By the foothills of the Himalayas;
Urbanization is proceeding rapidly,
And it is estimated that only 30%
Of the population entering
The labor force in the future will be absorbed into agriculture,
Although many will likely find other kinds of work in rural areas
The areas around Dhaka and Comilla are the most densely settled
The Sundarbans, an area of coastal tropical jungle
In the southwest and last wild home of the Bengal Tiger,
And the Chittagong Hill Tracts
On the southeastern border with Burma
And India, are the least densely populated,
Naturally, it is a beautiful country
Having plain and fertile lands
Which produce plenty of cash crops and food grains
It has lots of tourist spots,
Cox's Bazar is the longest sea beach in the world is in Bangladesh,
It is arguably the most popular tourist spot in Bangladesh,
Is visited by a large number of tourists from Britain,
America, Korea, Japan, India, Nepal, Pakistan
And many other countries each year
Though there is no record
Kept by the Bangladesh Porjatan Corporation (BPC)
On how many people visit the beach annually,
An AFP report says that during the winter
There can be 10,000 available rooms
In the beach area Accommodations
Near the beach range
From expensive high-end resorts to more reasonable options
Many private hotels, BPC Motels, and two "Five-star" hotels
Are located on or near the beach,
Such it will go on
I won't finish writing.
