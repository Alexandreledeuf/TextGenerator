France is a beautiful place,
With so much history to see,
And so many people to meet,
And so much food to eat.
This is what makes it fun because
France is a beautiful place,
And meeting Victor Hugo would be great,
And meeting French poets even greater.
The Enlightenment happened here,
With Montaigne, Rousseau, and Diderot, since
France is a beautiful place,
And Alexandre Dumas would have been proud.
Kings and queens ruled here,
Until Robespierre took control,
And democracy started, and ah,
France is a beautiful place.
