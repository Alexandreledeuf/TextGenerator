What and how is my mind?
Mind is my soul mate
Mind is my memory
Mind is my conscience;
Mind is my sense
What and how is my mind?
Mind is my sensitivity
Mind is my modesty;
Mind is my honesty
Mind is my rationality
What and how is my mind?
Mind is my virtue;
Mind is my duty
Mind is my responsibility;
For human and for God
What and how is my mind?
