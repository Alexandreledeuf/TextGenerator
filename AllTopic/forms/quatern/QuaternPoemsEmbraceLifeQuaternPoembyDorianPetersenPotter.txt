Embrace your life no matter what.
Start with heartful of love and hopes.
Never let yesterday rob your dreams.
Look at this day with brand-new eyes.
The best for you might still to come.
Embrace your life no matter what.
Listen to the beat of your heart.
Nothings over till God says so.
Embrace day with all ups and downs.
Climbing to top of mountains hard.
Embrace your life no matter what.
There's light at end of dark tunnel.
Nothing stays the same in this life.
But there's always God, love, dreams, hope.
Pray be strong when things don't look good.
Embrace your life no matter what.
