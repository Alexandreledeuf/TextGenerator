Flowers and birds are in nature
With some significant features,
To make it fruitful and cute
For long they have to do hard,
For livings of many other creatures
Flowers and birds are in nature
So, I cannot find other way but
To go to them for a lots of needs;
Flowers' dance and birds' song are
To cause motion in earth's creatures
Flowers and birds are in nature
To satisfy them supplying things ever;
They respectively perfume and tune spread,
Again, flowers are for honey and fruit
And birds are for ecological fit, therefore
Flowers and birds are in nature.
