The rays of the first sun of New Year
At the early morn just after it rising
Is beautifully smiling seen through the window pane
And makes me laugh frankly on;
And fills me with unending ecstasy
The rays of the first sun of New Year
Shows much hopes for humanity,
Persuading my mind with truth beauty and equity;
I warmly welcome it as the earth has been
A stony spot without any point of softness,
The rays of the first sun of New Year
You come to fill the narrow hole of hopelessness;
It seems bestowing a great pleasure to me
But, how is to others in this same earth?
I think to be the same for year round to all humans
The rays of the first sun of New Year.
