Befriending the enemy
Meet them silently,
Request to sit by you
Invite to three things to do;
To put their hands on your hands,
Befriending the enemy
To shaw that befriends
You and them friends;
As you are friends then
Are not enemy again,
Befriending the enemy
You'll share and each you'll bear;
Finally take a vow that none will violate
And end with a moral
That no one will be immoral
Befriending the enemy.
