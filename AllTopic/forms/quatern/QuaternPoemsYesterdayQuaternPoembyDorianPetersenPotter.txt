Yesterday came and left again.
It'll be a memory in my brain.
But now it seems just like a dream.
That may bring sunshine's brightest gleam.
I think I can make it on the dot.
Yesterday came and left again.
I try to enjoy what I got.
If I don't get stuck in the past.
Swirling with it's ups and downs fast.
But of my past have to let go.
Yesterday came and left again.
That's the way goes and that's so!
I try to enjoy what I got.
Good to know that for some I've fought.
Always something to lose or gain
Yesterday came and left again.
