Our school is the second to our big society
Every male and female are here students
Willingly and unwillingly they have to study
For life, worldly and spiritually development;
Again, our society is the second to nature
Nature is source and holder of former two
Are the school and the society together
For their growing, learning and earning cue;
Sometimes our social rules and subjects
Are made well, fair and clear to understand
Sometimes are unclear and quite vague
For some socio-political leaders' evil hands;
School, society have already been corrupted
Now nature is undertaken and planned,
And a certain percent of it has already been
Captured, poisoned and polluted by them.
