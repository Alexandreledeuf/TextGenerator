Life is just too short as it is
We all need someone to love to
You need to think of others too
Don't think all the time of just you
Think of others who have needs too
Life is just too short as it is
Some go thru worse things than we do
So help, pray for those that you know
Sometimes we have to take a stand
Be strong and voice your concerns too
Life is just too short as it is
So be true and believe in you!
Believe in better tomorrow
Direct emotions to calmness
Live life, love long, enjoy it all
Life is just too short as it is.
