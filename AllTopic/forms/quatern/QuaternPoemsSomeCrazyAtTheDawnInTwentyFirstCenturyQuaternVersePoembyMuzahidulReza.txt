Now you are noisy, poor country
Without wise leaders look crazy,
With chaos, violence, anarchy
So, try to disturb the whole world;
Rest of the countries are concerned
Now you are noisy, poor country,
All the countries are a body
One disturbed disturbed the body;
All want you should think of the fact
On the true progress making works,
Now you are noisy, poor country
So to progress you set veto;
Sad! You are trying to stop peace
Will be the boomerang to you,
In wrong mind you fail to know as
Now you are noisy, poor country.
