facebook is one of the recent social media
And not anybody's personal pages of book or notes,
Here people can start activities opening accounts
Where they post their photos, writings, etc. they like;
They post those and share with their friends
Some friends like them and highly comment
That inspires and helps them at the moment
Thus they amuse greatly among themselves;
And thus the number one nature of facebook is seen,
Through acting, reacting, liking, commenting and sharing
And these activities always differ and depend
From person to person and on personal demand;
Imparting and learning educations and information,
Running business, adding commodities and other;
Recreational sports, movies, cartoons and funs
Without some abusers' abusing it is quite good.
