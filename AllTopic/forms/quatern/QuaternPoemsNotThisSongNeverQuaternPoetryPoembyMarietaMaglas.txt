In the night,  the song  waves start to disappear
Like white trees, when there is no one their fall to hear.
Earth's shadow hides the moon, a harp without strings.
Lasting love shines  on crazy engagement rings.
What does love mean, when the elves come life to cheer?
In the night,  the song  waves start  to disappear,
And in the moonlight your feelings  become  blue.
The flowers cry for our time with tears of dew.
Bud butterflies become whispers in our dreams
To complete our entwining in the life's  streams.
In the night, the song  waves start to disappear
On the moon, a double-meaning pamphleteer.
The green knows that  through the darkness shines the light.
Love has a sense when the saints pray for the height.
And life blooms, when the God's angels hurry near.
In the night,  the song  waves start  to disappear.
