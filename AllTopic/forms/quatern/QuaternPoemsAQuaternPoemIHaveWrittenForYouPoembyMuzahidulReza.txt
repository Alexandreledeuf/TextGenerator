A quatern poem I have written for you
With fragrant ink from Saudi Arabia,
In mighty pen from Egyptian Museum,
On colorful pad and paper from Japan;
Sitting in the Wales' queen's garden
A quatern poem I have written for you,
When the fragrant flowers were blooming
Roses were spreading charming smell;
Butterflies were more funny flying around
Some nice ones happily sat on the pad,
A quatern poem I have written for you
When I was in the most well mood;
It was early autumn and late afternoon
I was lucky as yet no leaf did fall
In deep mind being a little emotional
A quatern poem I have written for you.
