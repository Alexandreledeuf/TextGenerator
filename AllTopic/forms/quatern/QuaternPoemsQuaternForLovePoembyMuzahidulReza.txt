(Love In Quatern Verse)
You say, "Put a note on our love"
I am gonna try though is tough,
It is soft as feather, cotton;
As silk, velvet; pure water;
Costly jewellery to women,
You say, "Put a note on our love"
Autumnal white clouds and catkin,
First spring's flower, smell and air;
You do not utter or beckon
I am yet answering on; then
You say, "Put a note on our love"
New leaves stir in the breeze of spring;
First baby laughs at lap of mom,
Oasis at desert to walkers,
Only the moon shines at the dark
You say, "Put a note on our love."
