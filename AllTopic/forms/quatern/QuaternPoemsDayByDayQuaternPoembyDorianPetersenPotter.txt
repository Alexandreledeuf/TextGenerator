Day by day with God make my way.
With courage I need to do this.
I'll never quit no matter what.
I will hold my head high all time.
Rise walk thru all in spite of wrongs.
Day by day with God make my way.
In heart want to follow his plan.
That can be done I know can be.
Proceed with care with song in heart.
Within it I listen his voice.
Day by day with God make my way.
With him beside accomplish this.
Sometimes I have lots in my plate.
Always set goals where belong to.
With God and faith conquer fear all.
Day by day with God make my way.
