A quatern has four stanzas, each of which has four lines. Each line contains eight syllables. It does not have to rhyme, but it does follow a specific pattern of line repetition: the first stanza's first line is repeated as the second stanza's second line, the third stanza's third, and the final stanza's fourth.
Worth
My humble soul receives its worth
as hands caress the fertile soil.
A grateful earth rewards my heart
with gift of seed to tend and sow.
As saplings rise from 'neath the ground,
my humble soul receives its worth.
They seek nutrition from the sun
and thirst for April's sodden dower.
through tender care they thrive and grow
and in return they nourish me.
My humble soul recieves its worth
with every breath of pure grown air.
With every blossom's lovely bloom,
with every grass and tree that's green,
with every rose whose thorns do sting,
my humble soul receives it's worth.
