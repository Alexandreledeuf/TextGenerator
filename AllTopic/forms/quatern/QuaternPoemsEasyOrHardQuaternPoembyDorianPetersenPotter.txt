We can't have everything we want.
Some walk around with almost all.
While most folks don't even get some.
That's life and better accept it.
Can't force feeling on anyone.
We can't have everything we want.
You either gonna be lov'd or not.
The point is get with the program.
Life easy or hard you name it.
We make decisions along way.
We can't have everything we want.
Many folks win while the rest lose.
And that's the way all goes in life.
With God will make it thru rough times.
Loved or hated always be yourself.
We can't have everything we want.
