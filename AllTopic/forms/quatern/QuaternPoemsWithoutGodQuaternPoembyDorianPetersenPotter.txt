Pressures in life strong and many.
The devil just want to destroy.
He'll do this only if allowed.
But with God He has no power.
World beautiful but fill'd of sin.
Pressures in life strong and many.
What's good to have all without God?
There's lack of love and compassion.
Nothing in this world's forever.
Try to live my life best I can.
Pressures in life strong and many.
I may not have friends but have God.
God watches my back all the time.
With Him I have my life and more.
Without God I'd been gone and lost.
Pressures in life strong and many.
