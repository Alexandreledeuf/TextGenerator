From the arrival of humans, creations in the earth
Vast markets in the world have been being on
Where walking human sellers and buyers all times
While selling and buying commodities for lives;
They are treating and ill-treating to the products
From the arrival of humans, creations in the earth
For, some are losing; some are gaining in markets
So, some are crying; some are laughing always
Nothing is halting for anyone in the earth, anyway
All that creations are quickly passing away
From the arrival of humans, creations in the earth
Though humans are trying to protest those's death;
Leaving behind the inevitable ideas and thoughts
In the markets they are merely doing what they want,
Vainly they are trying to swindle the universe
From the arrival of humans, creations in the earth.
