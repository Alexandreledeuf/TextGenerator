As we grow old we all slow down.
Our bodies go through many changes.
Metabolism slows down that too.
We lose muscle, some hair and teeth.
Nothing works the same when you're old.
As we grow old we all slow down.
As the body ages you get more tired.
Harder to get up, get going.
When getting old you lose your youth.
Most folks gain lots of wisdom too.
As we grow old we all slow down.
You forget more than used before.
Our children may all be grown up.
For senior's harder to move 'round.
We get wrinkles, gray hair, body hurts.
As we grow old we all slow down.
