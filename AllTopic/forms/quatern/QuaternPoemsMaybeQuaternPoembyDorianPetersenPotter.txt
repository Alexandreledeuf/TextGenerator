Maybe sometimes I'm just a fool
Maybe I just love you too much
Maybe sometimes can't understand
That all that I do is not enough
Maybe what I want can not have
Maybe sometimes I'm just a fool
And none of my dreams will come true
Maybe you don't know how to love
And can't face each day with a smile
Maybe cry and cry when we're alone
Maybe sometimes I'm just a fool
And you can not really change
Maybe all good days are behind
Accept happiness doesn't exist
Maybe we're cursed from birth to pain
Maybe sometimes I'm just a fool
