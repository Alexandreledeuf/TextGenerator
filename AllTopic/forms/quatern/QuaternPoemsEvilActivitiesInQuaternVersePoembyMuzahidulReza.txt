Having rationality don't be greedy
And don't envy of any,
Don't be angry unnecessarily
And don't be the center of anger;
Don't make enemy illegally
And don't be enemy awfully
Don't hate bitterly to be hated
In this mortal world;
In their life all the greedy
All the guilty and all the angry
And all the envious
Develop hatred, enmity and chaos;
With the muse of satanic curse
Greed, envy, wrath, hatred, pride hover
To commit all evil and bestial activities
To cause humans harm one another.
