The real love never ends
Wins in time
And gains
Though the earth one day will perish;
Present but unseen
The real love never ends
It is undying
And everlasting;
It relates with the soul
Immortal
The real love never ends
Survives winning mortality;
Elements in the air are true
Soul in the living body is true
Only replaceable
The real love never ends.
