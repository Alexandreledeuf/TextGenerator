The song is sung
The song says for human
Is the golden song,
I hear it;
On hearing I imagine a full moon
The song is sung
As calm and soft as peace
And happiness;
I do not say it is as feather
In my bower
The song is sung
For all other;
I invite the angels come and bathe
From heaven to earth
And sing the golden song
The song is sung.
