Experiences earn'd from living life.
You can read but are you learning?
Everything in life has price tag.
You can't pass tests without fire.
Don't look out too much see inside.
Experiences earn'd from living life.
When life throw you rocks make a soup.
Turn page of book when done go next.
Nothing in this life last forever.
Look 'round twice do you see things same?
Experiences earn'd from living life.
Make peace with self don't look back.
Life's school of learning everyday.
Are you learning from your mistakes?
When life hand you lemons make juice.
