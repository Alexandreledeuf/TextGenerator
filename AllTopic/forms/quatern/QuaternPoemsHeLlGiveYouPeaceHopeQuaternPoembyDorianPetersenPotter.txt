He'll give you peace and hope
when with life you can't cope
He'll help you to be strong
when everything go wrong.
When you fight and struggle in vain
He'll give you peace and hope
And He'll take away your pain
When you're at end of rope
His love in your heart will flow
when your spirit is sad and low
He'll give you peace and hope
each time you reach an steep slope
When troubles pile wide and high
Ask Lord Almighty for help each day
Before God just kneel and pray
He'll give you peace and hope.
