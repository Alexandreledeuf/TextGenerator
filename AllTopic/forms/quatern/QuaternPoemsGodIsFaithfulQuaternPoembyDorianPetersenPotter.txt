Because He's our Savior and King
Let's unite our voices in praise
To world proclaim all His glory
Today is time to praise the Lord.
Seek His face and you'll find His grace
Because He's our Savior and King
He's my defender and refuge
And want to serve Him forever.
My heart sing for Him many songs
My soul in Him always rejoices
Because He's our Lord and King
With Him I am never afraid.
He's with me, when I feel lonely
And just know that I'm not alone
Jesus is near, not far away
Because He's our Lord and King.
