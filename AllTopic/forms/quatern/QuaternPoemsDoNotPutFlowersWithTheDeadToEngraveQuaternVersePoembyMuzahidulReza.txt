Do not put flowers with the dead to engrave
But make them flowers when they are alive
To spread sweet smell, beauty and purity
To love other and to make other love all widely;
Dead body will be spoiled soon after engraving
Do not put flowers with the dead to engrave
Flowers need more to the alive in their working
As they spread active smell, beauty and purity;
If the alive are like flowers will pray for the dead
That will help the dead's souls to be successful
Do not put flowers with the dead to engrave
But pray for them for their salvation, above all;
The dead are lifeless but their deeds are living
Will help them to cross all the dangers in time
If you really want to do something great for them
Do not put flowers with the dead to engrave.
