Sweet water.
Coloured every shade,
By rainbow that caught my tears.
Crashing wild
Ocean child.
Through all the special years.
As sunset bled.
Love ran barefoot through my head.
My soul
Danced across the esplanade
To find horizons.
Where she had laid
That seascape down.
Where our dreams cascade.
Such joy
Is never real.
Until looking back.
Then you feel
All love that was made.
In naked moonlight
Under cascade.
She washed me clean.
No shooting star
That has ever been
Has ever seen
Such burning night.
Started by a raging sight
Of loving eyes.
Now rushing
Gushing
Before it dies.
Like a million hearts
With silver darts.
That waterfall.
When passion starts
We steal,
Like midnight raid.
Unreal.
That sprinkling
Twinkling
Cascade, .
