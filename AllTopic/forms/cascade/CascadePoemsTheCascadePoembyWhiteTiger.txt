Sitting on a rock, near a cascade
Reflections from the sun, on the waters parade
Cold, jet stream, falling from grace
Filling the lake, in this tranquil place
It rests my soul, to hear the sound
Of this flowing essence, caressing the ground
It runs endlessly, to enchant and entice
This cascade in the midst, and middle of paradise.
