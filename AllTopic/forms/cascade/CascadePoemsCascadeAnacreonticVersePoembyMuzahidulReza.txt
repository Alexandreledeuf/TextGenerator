Water falls
From upper source
From any hill
Or mountain
May be from any cave
Then it falls
Just from up to down
Named waterfall;
But while falling
It scatters some
Beautiful scenes
Some romantic tones,
Thus flows from
Mountain to ocean;
To the way
It is named
Spring, brook, river
Even public lake
However, it is
Known cascade
First falls and then
Flows down forever.
