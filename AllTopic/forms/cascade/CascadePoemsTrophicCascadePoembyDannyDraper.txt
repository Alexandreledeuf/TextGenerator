What is undone can't always be remade,
Deconstructed, wayward and discrete
Her myriad tangled beauties in a trophic cascade.
Soft tree voices on music daily played
Aeolian chants of wisdom replete,
What is undone can't always be remade.
Unearthed keystone to a doorway displayed
Wonder at a ruin and it's constructed feat,
Her myriad tangled beauties in a trophic cascade.
A land adjusts, but is lost and dismayed
Riches now vanquished and beat,
What is undone can't always be remade.
Restore the top predator, old villain portrayed
Repairing fabric long since incomplete,
Her myriad tangled beauties in a trophic cascade.
Nature waits impoverished, there is no crusade,
Deficiencies restored, sprints on ancient feet,
What is undone can't always be remade
Her myriad tangled beauties in a trophic cascade.
