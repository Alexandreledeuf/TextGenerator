Learning From Nature (Cascade Poetry)

In pond there is no flow
Flow is in river
In ocean there it is so,
Flowless one is like pond
Every day they are same
In pond there is no flow,
River is a good source
River like there are many
Flow is in river,
I'm pond! River I should be,
Then let me be ocean
In ocean there it is so.
