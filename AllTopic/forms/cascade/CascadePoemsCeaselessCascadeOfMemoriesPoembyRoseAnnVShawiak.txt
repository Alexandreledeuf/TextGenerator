Rolling, racing faster and faster, voices singing, taking
me along pathways of rhythm so placid and soothing.
Caressing this heart, letting it beat in time with rhythms
being listened to.
So intensely falling into this mind with designs flowing
into and over patterns, so delicate and interesting.
Beautiful sensations lifting desires to the forefront,
applying the most brilliant colors to poetry that is being
written.
Hues flowing over every note, gathering and collecting them
so quickly and rapidly, keeping time with every beat.
Solitary peace, giving an essence to passion that is already
within.
Carefully, exercising intellect as it wafts breezily into the
sky blue atmosphere, nothing standing in the way of meanings,
definitions coming into mind.
A ceaseless cascading of memories, images, and visions,
filling me constantly with their incessant beats.
