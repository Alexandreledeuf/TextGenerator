The sun rose blazing the forest
in a fiery glow.
Hopping
Hopping on the cushioned floor
of fallen pine needles
Was a magpie-resplendent
in his black tuxedo
With a starched white shirt.
His tuxedo tails flapped
the ground
as
he scurried about gathering
tidbits of food.
Cascade
Cascade.
Thank you for my childhood
In the mountains
And the valleys
And around Cascade Lake
I was safe.
I roamed constantly
One with nature.
Thank you!
