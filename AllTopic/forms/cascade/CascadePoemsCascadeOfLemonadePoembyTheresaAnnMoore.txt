Dry parched tongue and cracking lips
Longing for something wet and pleasing
Experiencing a complete brain eclipse
Losing consciousness …wheezing
Escaping an arid desert of drought
Caught up in a surge of believable illusion
Soaked in coolness…there is no doubt
Citrus libation satisfies a dusty delusion
The sensation of tartness is a real eye opener
Making flattened hair stand up straight in the air
There is no need to be hasty and call the coroner
A cascade of lemonade has ended the nightmare
