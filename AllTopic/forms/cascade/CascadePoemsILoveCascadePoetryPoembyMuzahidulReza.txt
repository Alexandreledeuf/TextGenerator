I Love (Cascade Poetry)
February 22, 2020
A flow from brain and heart says
"Hey! Will you love or hate? "
"Love, love, love, love, love", I say.
Now I love father and mother,
Brother, sister and others also;
A flow from brain and heart says;
Environment, plants and animals
As well as says the whole world,
"Hey! Will you love or hate? "
As human, I have the mission
Methinks, its part is not hating,
"Love, love, love, love, love", I say.
