A scene right behind my eyes,
cascades like a rippling effect
as sure as the sun arises
sending shivers up and down
my arms
creating an abstract view to
absorb everything into my
developing a creative mind of
eternal evocative thoughts and
Other dramatic scenes of
Fantasy, fiction or even funny
Developing roles right within my
exciting or even evocative thoughts which
lightly caresses the paper within the palms
interior in the warmth of my fingers and
gently in my hand, as I write and enhance the
heightening crescendo nearing into an ending at
the end of the scariest story I've ever written.
