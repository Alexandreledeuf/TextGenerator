Each tear is a reflection of hope
That at the end of every weep
There is a smile to wear and keep
No matter how a sobbing water runs deep
Each tear is an epitome of strength
That another day is to come and hold
Beauty from pain to blossom and behold
No matter how tales were sadly told
Each tear is a complement of love
That pain and love go together
Like the raindrops fallin from above
No matter how lovely is the weather.
Each tear marks my summer in May
When the moon embraces the sun
As they kiss goodnight and say
Someday we'll be in this sky as one
