My sweetheart you are a wonderful cascade
Your beauty makes entire surrounding glade
In hot summer burning sun you are like shade
In lovers reckoning you are of superior grade
My love is in trance as your beauty swayed
My soul takes to be cut with sharp blunt blade
Your glowing cheeks have launched just a raid
At peril of my life the eternal price I just paid
Like moon in stars your sweet beauty outstayed
With your beauty in my veins I have to renegade
My love is like a music and your beauty serenade
Your beauty is eternal but my love is just to fade
