Cascade
She threw cascades of rainbow colored flowers
Down the street as she hopped and skipped down it.
My gosh it was splendid.
For a secret she only knew why.
Let me see.
It was someone's birthday
Or wedding anniversary or anything of that sort.
But my oh my it was gorgeous.
The cascade of flowers were pretty.
