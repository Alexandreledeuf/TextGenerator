Glist'ing drops
Splashing into fine mistâ€”
I become one with the waterfall.
Feeling joy
As droplets kiss my face
And enter my soul's most sacred place.
Crystalline,
Anointing me with love,
Sustaining all life forms on the Earth.
Gratitude
For each divine droplet;
A cascading veil of purity.
