A familar cascade, your life remains meaningless
But the man above has hope for you....
All he asks is that you believe.
Trust that he will come to your pain.
Haunted by the sins among your shadows.
He will forgive the past...
He will forgive infamy....
It won't be long until you scream for his grace.
That's the only hope you have to survive in this place.
Fear no more, you will be praised with salvation
Raise your head up to the sky now, your days
of shame will be forgotten.... just call for his name
Your savior awaits
