Tonight is perfect for staying inside,
but I'm busy contorting my organs.
For instance, my heart and brain love to fight.
Sometimes, you can see them twist my body
this way and that when it is raining, though
tonight is perfect for staying inside.
My lungs breathe heavy and my skin itches
to touch you, to let you know I'm all right,
but I'm busy contorting my organs.
It's a put off, I know. Losing control
when I'm around you, unable to say,
for instance, my heart and brain love to fight.
