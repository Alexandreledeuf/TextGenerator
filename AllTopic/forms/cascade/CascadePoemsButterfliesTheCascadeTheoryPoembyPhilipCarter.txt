Where are they going?
Their flight seems so aimless
A gentle breeze alters their flight path
Up & down, back & forth
No direction is the target
They have no defence against predators
They are helpless
Yet, with a beat of their fragile wings
They can change the weather pattern
In distant countries, thousands of miles away.
