I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys (Solomon’s songs of songs)
The fall of a cascade
The water in the depths of the spring of her heart had grown completely dry
Many would pass by in hope to taste these waters
But would abstain after they realized it was now dry
They often gathered among themselves
Trying to gather a conclusion
Her waters once produced chaste waters they’d say
So they asked: who dried up the cascade?
A sigh released as I replied:
One day a man in a mask wandered by her waters
Opening the dams of her heart
He entered and soiled what once was bountiful and pure
By the time the dams of her heart attempted to close, she realized they had been broken
Euphoria no longer greets her lips
Love’s rain no longer falls
Thus the cascade began to dry.
They looked on in bewilderment and pointing at the waters they replied:
But behold, her waters are slowing rising.
