who hears what comes from outside I.
could only be a car mount's tone
that no one misses, that comes alone
all on its own from where the heck.
what i am not that feeds on need
so that thinking bites the rounder.
for he courts the miller
with sluggers every hour.
for homeland's sake he bends a rule
look here look here iamb you too
how longer still the Ã¼ber allles
shush, dear country, pressed for dollars.
before I something from without
for none devours the entire hour
about the smock and silence
the judge will want to bend.
and all's questions oven.
