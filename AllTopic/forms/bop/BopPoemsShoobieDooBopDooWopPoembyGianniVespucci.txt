I'm only as amazing as I left myself be
Let my mind wander so the light I can finally see
See now baby I made this far
And i did it with you my shining star
It's true, I adore you
And if you only knew too
I don't want to leave you behind
I want you forever by my side
You're the one from which I can't hide
With your hazel eyes
Why won't you just come with me
So we can be side by side under this Italian moonlight
Baby darling, Don't you know you got me smiling
Girl you know I'm proud of you
With a soul as beautiful as cerulean blue
And if you think that I never knew
You better think twice
'Cause you're my sweet dearest
Keep you the nearest
To my heart, Sweetheart I love you and adore you
All day and night, This has to be right
Our bond is packed tight
At the end of this letter, doll you better
Write back so I can go with you to and fro
'Cause it's best we don't let this go
Standing by your side weary, Oh so eerie
With affection
I hope you do hear me, And share
The adoration
As you put your lips up to mine, I'll tell you
That your loving will always be true
Baby I'm going with you
Be happy with me all the way through
You're my soul mate baby, Who knew
That it would be us, Who knew
