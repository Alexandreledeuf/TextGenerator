there are fires in the west
typhoons in the east
socialists live in the north
with reds in the southern heat
concrete tattoos the land
exhaust scratches at the atmosphere
so, mother earth
sends a hand to
brush away her only tear
let us overload
let us think we know
let us push forward to
our hindsight dredged
and
indifferent ends.
