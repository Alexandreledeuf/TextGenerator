(lyrics)
Sun shines above me,
melting me down,
my love just kissed me 'hello'.
The day is on and
all things around
are making me feel I'm in love.
Cause winter's leaving,
is hurting no more.
I know she's dreaming of me now.
My heart sings songs for her,
will she hear, clear,
all this music that I have?
Dance crazy feeling,
twisting around,
my love lies safe in my eyes.
I know that soon she'll
fall in my arms
and then we'll be the happiest ones.
...but not yet!
