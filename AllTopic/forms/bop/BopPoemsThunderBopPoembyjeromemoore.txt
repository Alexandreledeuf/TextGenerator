I got a finger snap in my ear
the clouds are hung low
and the sky tells a tale
of how its like below
The rain is beating down
and the fireworks are lighting
explosions close to home
as the eastern world is fighting
with a tiger in the tank
and the pot is boiling under
this desert scream I'm hearing
rolls down highways like thunder
fireball water balloons
disney PSA
God is in a prison camp
for lack of DNA
The storm wanders crazy-like
faster than a train
the cattle eat their corn
while producing more methane
The universe is expanding
as the human mind is diminished
this orchestra in my soul
says the human race is finished
