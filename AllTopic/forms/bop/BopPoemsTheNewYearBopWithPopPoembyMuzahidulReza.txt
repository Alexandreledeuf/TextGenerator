At arriving the New Year
They are making funs, cutting jokes
Then bop, bop
With the new year pop
And are singing top
With rhythmic pop,
The new year bop with pop;
They are happy like school children,
Laughing like small children,
As glad as green trees,
Running like stormy winds,
Crying like the sea birds,
Barking like the wild dogs,
Jumping like gazelles, stags;
Breaking like tigers and lions
The new year bop with pop;
Thus they welcome New Year
Putting on festive wears
Eating well pudding
Forming new choirs
Singing new carols
Just after Christmas holidays,
The new year bop with pop.
