You do like or not
Time will pass
Things will happen
Well or ill in time
Your deeds are for yours
You will be responsible for those,
Nothing will be done behind;
Your planted trees will offer you
The fruits those catch
You do accept or reject
Time will pass
You will gain
Or you will get loss,
So you should have thought
Before doing that,
Nothing will be done behind;
Big trees can't be cut short
Again need to be planted
No time,
Teach your generations
Make them understand
Your wrongs,
Nothing will be done behind.
