The nurses can drive a coach
and horses through the doctor's life~
smack-talk, crackbrained,
thwack, thwack, thwack,
a chorus of boos
and time for strife.
The nurses are not witches,
Do not have magical powers.
The witches can belittle
the medical skills. They can
fire broadside after broadside.
Catcalls are to be shouted
subsequent to delivering brickbats.
Their secret depth ~ a jest.
In summer, they love
to lie on some beaches' breasts.
The nurses are not witches,
Do not have magical powers.
Therefore, they are abandoned
by their doctors, but this attitude
cannot panic them. They continue
to play their well-known network
games and to flutter dropping invoices~
painted in red and black.
The nurses are not witches,
Do not have magical powers.
The mimic show of the patients
is a sell-out. The nurses receive
new flower rewards. The witches
can play song games like
"Ring-a-ring o' roses, a pocket full of posies."
Well, there is a coming spring
in everyone, in everything, and
in all the senses.
The nurses are not witches,
Do not have magical powers.
