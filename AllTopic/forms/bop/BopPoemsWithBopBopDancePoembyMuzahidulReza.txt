Bop bop dance was well going
With pop pop band;
And hop hop jump
On the sea sand;
Pomp pomp show
In the day of grand,
With bop bop dance all are enjoying;
A concert on the beach
Some foreign and home singers
Together on the sand
Singing and singing
Pop pop music spreading
Singers and audiences are bop bop dancing
Wind blowing, mind flying,
With bop bop dance all are enjoying;
All nightlong goes the concert
All the singers and audiences are inspired
By the sea high waves
Were falling on the sand
The audiences enjoyed both
The big band on the sea shore,
With bop bop dance all are enjoying.
