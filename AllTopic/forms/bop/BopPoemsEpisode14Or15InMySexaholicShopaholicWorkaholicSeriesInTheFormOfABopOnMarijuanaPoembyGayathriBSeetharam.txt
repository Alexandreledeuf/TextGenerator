Marijuana is legal in Canada under PM Justin Trudeau's government
And I must say as a young comely maiden growing up in Bangalore, India
Smoking cigarettes occasionally started as a sure way of getting male attention
And a definite way of strengthening female friendships
For the Sexaholic in me did not make her debut until I got married
Once, my male cousin, Naresh, who has tragically suffered an early demise
Gave me a marijuana reefer and I took a couple of drags and heard my mother call out to me
Such was the power of my mother's possible anger that the effects of the happiness drug was wiped out by the act of making tea for all of us;
It's a wonderful life (Refrain) .
But as a Shopaholic trying out a new recipe, I bought hemp hearts, the next best thing
And planned on sometime telling my husband to hump tarts like me
Such unladylike language must be followed by simply delicious muffins
Which is like a brown version of the blue hearted blueberry muffins served in the recently closed neighbourhood Starbucks
And as a Shopaholic back in the days of residence in Ottawa with my son, I had participated in the Du Maurier Open
Quite in the feminist way for I loved to imitate the actions of my husband enjoying the aftermath of sex;
It's a wonderful life (Refrain) .
As a Workaholic, I must draw your attention to a paper of mine published in Facebook-PubMed/NatureBiochemEng
In which I have strengthened the argument with the principles of chem/biochem/biomedical engineering
The magazine, Mind over Matter's attestation that cannabinoidol, the non-psychoactive effect producing part of the cannabis plant
Acts as a possible cure for Alzheimer's Disease and other related dementia
And personally speaking for me, the ‘High' comes from being happy and cheerful
For I was severely depressed for a long time and having been dead as myself, the highs and lows of life
Seem to blend into a plateau"like" state of perpetual delight in the wonders of the world
And I seem to gloss over the sadness that afflicts all of us many a time.
It's a wonderful life (Refrain) .
