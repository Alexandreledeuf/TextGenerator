Welcome to New York City
The city that never sleeps,
Bean counters everywhere,
Everybody playin' for keeps,
Skinny women, high heel shoes,
Trottin' to the the top,
High steppin' over broken glass,
Big City Bop.
Sunny San Francisco,
See the veteran with one leg,
Exercising freedom of speech,
Exercising freedom to beg,
Here him shout to the chic
Good luck at the top,
Seven days a week,
Big City Bop.
Welcome to Dallas,
Pickups whizzing by
Big oil, big flag,
Big buildings up to the sky,
Big time, big deal,
Big bottom to the top,
Big shots, big wheel,
Big City Bop.
