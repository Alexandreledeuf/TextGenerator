I once heard a blue bird
it took me miles and miles past the city limits
to where the monks line up
and dexter lays it down.
wheres bird?
wheres Miles?
wheres the big beat?
co-Mingus the blues
the burn those red houses?
What ever happened to the cats?
predominating
the nature of the chase
and the cool cool beat
under nocturnal haze
free form jerky electric soul.
