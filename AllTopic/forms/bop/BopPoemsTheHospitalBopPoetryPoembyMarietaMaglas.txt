The moon gleams descend to rock the night, where
the void of universe haunts the dreams, in which
the music of nightmares glitters within yet without.
The arm of silence is a limb of pain. The death is
dancing with the life while keeping everything in white-
the coats, the walls, the beds and the skin of patients.
Some rays of light make slalom among planets when their stars
are pulsing spumes of life to travel from one end to another one.
The patients are like dancing skeletons needing love and
air for a good new breath. Their nightmares are loaned
by the void flounces and fear to fall. In this place, people
do not fight one another. The fight is inside and in self. The
fear hides behind the windows. It becomes a rabbit to jump
into souls. The joy cries in pain to withstand the oddities
of life.The hope dissipates in quiet lounges to smell like
illness, or cheap food and to flow into the longing to belong.
Some rays of light make slalom among planets when their stars
are pulsing spumes of life to travel from one end to another one.
Some patients leave their beds to go nowhere in search of the
grain of the universe. Mars is that red planet waiting at the green.
The quest still persists to pursue all through this disastrous existence.
The doctors are scared of not being able to save their patients with
their kisses flossed on lips to radiate when the patients have attacks
of not being able to breathe. Dreams desiccate the breeze of death.
