it amuses an
observant layman
to know
critical university
lecturers
opinionated
upon superficial
snippet examinations
using syntactical
grammatical dissection
methods analytical
could not cannot discern
discover key simple
poetic rules followed
free verse values paramount
theme impact over rigid rhyme
