Beauty is God
In words, in creations
Beauty is truth
In nature, in thought
Beauty is virtuous soul
In innocent, in saint
Beauty is integrity
In honesty, in sincerity
Beauty is legality
In power, in justice
Beauty is love
In reality, in humanity
Beauty is deeds
In doings, in done
Beauty is life
In properly spend,
Let's think of each
To beautify in and out of us.
