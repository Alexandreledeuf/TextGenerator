(for Annelize)
To you I give blood-red poppies
that carries my love before they do wither
and a pretty flower is in each cup
but just like you they are timid, coy and pretty
and later you will have to throw the lot away
but still the message that each one carry do remain
and lilies noble and whiter than milk
will maybe also at a time lie scattered
where I do believe that you are beautiful, sincere and noble
that passion and holy things comes in you to be fulfilled
that I can share a whole life with you from soul to soul,
for you my feelings are known and no secret
and to me you are far more precious than any flower
for my existence you are entirely essential.
