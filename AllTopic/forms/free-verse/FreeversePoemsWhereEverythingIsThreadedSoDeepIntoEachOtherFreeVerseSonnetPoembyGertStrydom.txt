(in answer to C. M. van der Heever)
The roses fold open their deep-red cups
where with a soft fragrance they do entice
when one after the other they do open with the sun
where it dips everything over the hillocks bloody red,
everything becomes brighter as the day continues,
Day lilies and morning glories follow the sun as it goes,
there is rejoicing in everything that does exist in the summer-days
where the redbreast, weavers and doves do walk to and thro.
Butterflies, beetles and bees frolic from flower to flower
where they gather nectar and everything is fertilised and impregnated
as if the existence of everything is threaded deep into each other,
the birds do peck the fruit that comes to fullness
and bright white-hot the sun hangs high in the sky
in the great cycle of nature's secrets.
