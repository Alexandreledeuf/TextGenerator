An excellent piece of modern poems
Full of darkness, chaos and trash
Of war, horror, terror, destruction
Violence, crimes, corruption, oppression
Depression, deprivation, frustration
Snatching, robbing, raping, wrong doing
Abducting, killing, cutting, firing, burning
Bombing, massacring, occupying
Torturing, tormenting, spoiling, damaging
Forgery, hypocrisy, lust and all ill forces mixed.
