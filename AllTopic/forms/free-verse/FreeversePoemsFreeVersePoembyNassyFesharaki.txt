Free verse
Push my nail in skin while reading
What is this?
We have burned rhymes, meters!
No Secrets
Yet shameless we insist â€˜is poem'
Junk poems
"Baby pissed", "The bird hissed"
Write or say
Empty is nonsense; or worthless
Time wasted
Does it have a message?
Will it be ambiguous?
Where is the beauty?
Where's softness?
It is exact; the tattoo of Rumi:
"Oh it hurts"
"This later"
"Not here'
And it ends:
"Has ever been lion without head, no tummy and no tail? "
