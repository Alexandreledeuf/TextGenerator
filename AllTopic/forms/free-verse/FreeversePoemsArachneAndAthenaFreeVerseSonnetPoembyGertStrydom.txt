Dewdrops hang like diamonds on the web and sparkle in the light
where a small black spider do wait patiently for an insect,
between prickly pears, in this construction the weight of the spider rests
when the sun rise over the horizon in an open new day.
The girl Arachne dares to challenge the goddess Athena to weaving
and where Athena makes a tapestry of the gods in their splendour,
the fine work of Arachne of their romances is lovelier,
where Athena tears that piece of art to shreds according to the old story
Arachne hangs herself on the strings for life and death
where she views herself equal to Athena and do to eternity spin webs,
as a spider having to catch insects for a life
and still do hang in her rebellion against the gods on her web
from where she does daily look upon Athena in arrogance
and keeps herself eternally cursed as a prisoner of her own will.
