A moving tree having various sections of branches
Of hope, despair, success, failure, vices and virtues
That inwards roots and outwards the saplings grow
With a course in mysterious way of moving to and fro
Through rough, plain, desert, forest, ocean, mountain
Straight, curving, zigzag, back-forth and up-down;
With all the liking-disliking colours−
White-black, red-grey, yellow-blue and ash-green
With some inevitable weathering facts−
Summer, spring, winter, autumn and late autumn
With some mixing emotions and temperaments−
Liking-disliking, loving-hating, laughing-crying
With some destructive and breath choking vices−
Envying, spoiling, shooting, bombing, killing
Again with some angelic qualities−
Praying, helping, making, thinking, inventing
With all there are some unavoidable plights−
Beginning, romance, curious, fierce, tumultuous
Mid, fit, unfit, calm and ultimate ending
Without noticing, informing, testing or warning.
