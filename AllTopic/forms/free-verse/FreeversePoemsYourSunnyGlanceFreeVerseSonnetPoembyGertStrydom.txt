(for Annelize, in answer to Daniel Hugo)
Your sunny glance is brighter and more cheerful
than the riant suns, moons and stars in the universe
when your smile do draw people during the day and night to you
and over you and with you I am infatuated, in love and totally crazy
where truth as utterly bright light do get meaning in you
as if God is present in your heart, spirit and soul
where as a human you do moment by moment make me happy
where the depth of love as open and plain for all to see
through God becomes immortal as something eternal between us
where He keeps giving the sincere truth and selflessness
when I pour out myself, my hart, spirit and soul and everything into you
and we as mere humans do enter something godly and inhuman
where the yearning of the flesh, body, soul and spirit
becomes one composition of the two of us without any fear.
