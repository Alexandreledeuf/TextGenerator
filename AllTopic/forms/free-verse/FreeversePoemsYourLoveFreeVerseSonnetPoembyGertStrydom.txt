(for Annelize, after I. D. du Plessis)
Your love is a pure light
that radiates my whole world
and you do love me intimately
when you do determine holy times for me,
where every word and deed
like nard do flow over me,
where constantly you do leave me speechless
where you do sacrifice yourself and do bleed,
do constantly treat me with great respect,
do overwhelm me with the person that you are
without me asking for any of this
as if you are acting in an unspoken secret way
and in your silent submission where you do serve me
it is the core of love that I do witness.
