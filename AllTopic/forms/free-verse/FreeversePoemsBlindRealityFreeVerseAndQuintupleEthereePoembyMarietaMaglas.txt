Hollow-eyed shades
of human beings,
human beings
cogitating on jazz music,
jazz penetrating the silence
of the bleeding angels,
angels in a fight for
the awakening of this blind reality,
wars,
racism,
asylums,
prostitution,
anxious women,
terrorist attacks,
public executions,
illegal immigration,
dengue fever, songs, low wages,
Zika and Chikungunya viruses,
human cells combined with mammal fetus,
monetization of the objects
emblazoned clothes &  precious stones,
Islamist militancy,
meteorite impacts,
vegetation fires,
crucifixions,
kidnappings,
sphinxes,
crimes,
drugs,
cocktails,
birth defects,
huge ocean waves,
ISIS strategies,
sexual harassments,
sales of stolen artifacts,
multiple vortex tornadoes,
quakes striking near the plate boundaries,
children murdered in egregious crackdowns,
food securities for starving people,
changes in refugee policies,
landslides, Monsoon rains and flash floods,
seasonal unemployment,
nuclear disasters,
smiling volcanoes,
price increases,
naked bodies,
hairstyles,
dreams,
cubes,
glasses,
gas stations,
interim work,
glacier calving,
protests blocking the roads,
new theatrical triumphs,
ill kids not displaying symptoms,
macroeconomic policies,
silent strategies of democracies,
different drivers having
different styles to run their cars,
cars blinking their headlights
while their motors scream,
screaming trees and revolvers
that shoot up walls to write lyrics,
lyrics of jazz penetrating the silence
of the bleeding angels,
angels in a fight for
the awakening of this new reality.
