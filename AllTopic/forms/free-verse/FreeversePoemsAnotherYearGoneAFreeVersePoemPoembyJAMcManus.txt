Is it just me or does time seem
To move faster the older you get?
It almost feels like the world is
Moving too quickly and I must
Move with it or be left behind,
For the world waits for no man
I can remember back to when
I was much younger than I am now it
Doesn’t seem that long ago, does it?
Perhaps it does, but I’m not certain
I can remember things, things that
Seem like they happened yesterday
But they don’t seem real somehow
The person in those memories is not me
Well, at least not the me that I am now
I have changed, the endless march
Of time has made sure of that but
I am not sad and I am not bitter
I have become a husband and a father,
And because of those precious gifts
I long to know what other beautiful things
I may become with the turning of the world;
But even the wonderful blessings which
May come in the years ahead make the
Speeding of time no less strange or frightening.
