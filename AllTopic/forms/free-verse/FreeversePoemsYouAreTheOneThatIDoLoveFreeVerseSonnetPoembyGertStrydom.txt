(for Annelize)
You are the one that I do trust with all my secrets
above all other women you are utter beautiful to me,
wonderful even when you do turn my world upside down,
you are the fortress that I do build against the world,
in the silent moments I think about you
and even if the black-collard barbet twitters the day red,
even if the frost of life is spread out everywhere
I pray to God to hold His hand over you,
heroic as a warrior you stand at my side,
are not blinded by the insanity of gossip
but it's with sincere love that you do come to me
where you are vulnerable but also a heroine to me
and I trust in our love and on God like a child
when day after day you astonish me with your humanity.
