She is so proud of her beauty and color
That I want much adoring her
She keeps her at far in a sweet temper
As she is seen in the picture,
But when I return from outside
She touches me with her body and tail
To attract me to demanding care
Sometimes she hugs me by my leg
To complain any body's misbehave,
She is my adorable pet cat
Whom I am fond of very much, thus
A mutual fondness has developed
As she follows me even at midnight
To obey any dear command.
