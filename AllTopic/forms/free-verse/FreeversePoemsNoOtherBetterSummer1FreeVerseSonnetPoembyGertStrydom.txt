Weavers do twitter, warblers chirp and doves coo
and the summer overflows with joy
but for the cat that do try to murder the birds
where from the branches of the fig tree the birds peep
and in the days of the summer I am swept away
by all of the birds that so cheerful do sing in their choir
and do notice them splash and drink at the water bowl
when they do flutter down and I do feed them crumbs
and every bird does sing an own love-song
that continually does sound up with joy
as if all of creation do enjoy this summer,
the birds land as if the fruit trees do beckon them,
know that they do offer seed and fruit to them
and I can think of no other better summer.
