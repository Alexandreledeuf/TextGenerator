A train of thought lost in the desert
Crashed on the tracks, while dripping out decisions
Which ran like butterflies
from the scene of a crime
Then words escaping, from earth quaking
Aftershock tore up Metaphors and allegories
Puncturing the reverb of the chromium parietal
Restart the engine with an artistic bandage
Took to meditating on a river
where I was fishing for a poem
With a diamond coloured spatula
When it jumped over my head into the forest
Evolving from a minnow into a whirlybird plane
that went through the clouds the led to the door
That went through the eyes
Of an ebony goddess
Whose lips were an enchantment
From a fiery catchment that she got from her father who was a
Voodoo Priestess who worked at the counter of a 7 /11
In Tucson Arizona, selling slurpies to teenagers
with terrible acne and who were friends with a ginger
with large ruby dimples
and who practised Kid Magic
from dungeons and dragons
that he trained on a bum who lost his legs in the war
and regrew into a centaur that re-examined his life
getting a licence as a real-estate agent, selling homes
in middle class suburbs where fluttered the noises
of faraway cities that eclipsed the distance
standing as columns of cavernous citadels,
Etched with in lime and volcanic basalt
You could see it half away in the form of a globe,
Tip it over and outpoured the wings of a poem
Unleashed as a phoenix with wings of a thesaurus
And as I searched for words of expression
It came fluttering in as a wrapped up present
and said to me;
'You cannot search for something that was already there'
