In the black townships the days and nights clatter pass
while mini-bus taxis are constantly at war
with every bus and train and do protect their routes with murder,
they shoot with AK-47's as they do drive pass
where this country is now free from law and order,
where things everywhere do only become weaker and do deteriorate
and for nobody there is respect or consideration
when Lucifer gets his claws into everything
and in the lawlessness do stick out his dark fingers
where white educated and qualified people are unemployed,
hordes of others do strike and even at universities do demonstrate violently
while criminals do merciless torture, rape, murder, rob and break
and God's mercy, His love do lack in the hearts of people
while Lucifer and his darkness is in the heart, the mind and eye.
