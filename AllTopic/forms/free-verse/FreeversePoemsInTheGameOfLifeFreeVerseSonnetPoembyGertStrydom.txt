(after Ina Rousseau)
Where each one of us stands on the stage of the world,
where our own lives are a scene before the universe
on a earth full of great darkness
Your bright searchlight does cut its own way,
each person's turn does come to go on
and the great secret of the spectacle
brings to everyone a unique meaning
where some do loose their lives for You,
like a player in a leading role or just a figure
do play out their roles for the last time,
others do unexpectedly disturb the lives of others,
do lead them off the road running to the other side
and the time is running out before the curtain does fall
while You do still perform as the big director.
