Running through the dark
lights and trees whipping past.
Claws shred the earth
and fur blows in the wind.
Fangs drenched in blood
my core burning in rage.
Wolves are extremly loyal
but just as posessive as well.
I'm her pet and she's
MY master as well.
curling at her feet, it feels nice.....
to be so close.
I nudge her leg gently with my muzzle
and look up into her golden eyes.
I'm happy she cares about me....
So rare...
Night is my domain
and my mistress.
