Where tiles and the roof meet each other
they did build a nest from grains of mud
to hold the small ones safe
and with the neat building work I am astonished
and I wonder from what offspring they do get the mud
where I do constantly look at those small birds,
just before the rain do notice their antics in the air
when they swish to and thro and they do turn around and around
but when the blue-white thunder does sound ominously,
both do quickly swish to their nurturing-place,
are out of the wild stormy-wind when drops do fall,
are covered in their own small fortress
and like this the God of the universe also covers us
draws us close in His embrace like children.
