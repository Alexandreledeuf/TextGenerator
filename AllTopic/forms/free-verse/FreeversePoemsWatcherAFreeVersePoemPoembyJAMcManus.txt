You are like a beautiful feather
That flutters upon a gentle breeze
I stand in silent wonder trying to
Not disturb your fragile journey
I bend down and kiss your forehead
And whisper in your ear ever so softly,
“You are as brilliant and inspiring as the
Dawning sun, for when I gaze at you
The darkness of the world fades away
Into nothingness; and is replaced by
Your warm and pure luminous beauty.”
