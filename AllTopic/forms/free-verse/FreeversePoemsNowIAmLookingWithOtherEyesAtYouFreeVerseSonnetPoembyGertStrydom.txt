(for Annelize, after A. G. Vissier in answer to André letoit)
I met you at college
and always you did greet me with a smile,
you were my own prophetic Letitia
and your lips and mouth was sugar-sweet
where the way that you did look at me,
how happy and beautiful you were
did predict my future, my love with you
and all the ways were open and even,
our love was something big and unique
with the sun in your eyes and I were constantly admiring you
as a Letitia euphoria
in a stretched out summer days with a very late sunset
but now that I do know you through and through
I do once more try to win your heart.
