(free verse) Here's A Bowl
To mix a salad in, Paladin
They say it contains the deepest despair
It's a Tiffany... Isn't it spiffany?
If you 'ping' it, it will echo most valiantly
Full of a mixture of daisies and crazies
For a goldfish (not just any old fish)
On a note pre-destinate
how many budgies could make a nest in it?
Now let's go peer into a cup...
