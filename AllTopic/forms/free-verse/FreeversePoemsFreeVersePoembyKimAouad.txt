I somehow seem to always comfort others with the words I want to hear
I hear myself telling people to stay srtong
And to hold on to what they love
And to let go of what is hurting them
And to work hard to earn what they want
And that everything's gonna end up just fine
And that eventhough it feels like the end of the world, it isn't
But when it comes to me
I'm the weakest person on earth
And I push what I love away because I fear getting hurt
And I hold on to what I know is of no good to me
And I expect to get what I want without working for it, but I don't, so I'm left with nothing
And I know for a fact that nothing really gets better:
I just get used to the situation I'm in
And the end of the world is basically every single night I'm alone with my thoughts
I've come to a conclusion that I crave seeing people being good at the things I'm bad at
I try my more than best to ensure the well-being of others while my own happiness is just an act so those I'm helping don't feel like there's something wrong
It's because I know what being down, being rejected, being hurt, and feeling worthless feel like, I don't want anyone to feel like that
I am not asking for your sympathy
I am not asking you to tell me words of comfort
Because this will only make me feel worse
And please, if you are going to say something, don't tell me that things are gonna be okay and that there is a light at the end of every dark tunnel
As I've said before, nothing really becomes 'okay'
And I know that every tunnel ends with a light
Just let me keep on doing what I'm doing because helping ones who have no one to hear them out or those who feel depressed or that nothing is right helps me, too, somehow
I think that by trying to understand others, it's one step closer to understanding myself
And in solving others' problems I find solutions to my own
I believe that the first step to knowing oneself is knowing others well as to discover what pleases or angers you and change your life to what suits you most
