Old generation goes
New generation comes
Hold them tightly in hands
Caress them properly in minds,
Teach them things they need
Make them gently mannered,
Leave things well for them
Don't leave them at dark
But leave them enlightened
They are tender hearted
Leave them not on stone
They are our new generation.
