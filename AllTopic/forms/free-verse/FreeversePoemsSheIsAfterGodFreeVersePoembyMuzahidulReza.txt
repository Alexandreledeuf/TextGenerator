In womb I was fed on the extraction of her body
I played, moved there wether night or day
She bore me with great care
She more thought of me than other
About how I would be
When I might come on her lap
What she would name me
How she would rear me up;
At last her waitness came to an end
On a favourable day l came
She forgot the pains from she suffered
The eye balls of her I became;
How much love, care, adore are in the earth?
All she brings and inserts on me
She overcomes all difficulties of me
From womb to the last she does breathe;
I have observed at adolescence
I have remembered her presence
None is like mother how may be they our
Mother is just mother none is like her
However she is to all other
To me, after God is my mother.
