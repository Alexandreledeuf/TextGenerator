(in answer to Marius Absalom)
I smell the rain that pours down and keeps falling on the wet ground
when a lightning-bolt does come down blue-white in the concrete jungle,
but everywhere small groups of people stand around in the alleys
and I would escape back to the rural countryside if I could
while neon-lights keep advertising all kinds of things
and slowly I take step after step while evil does hang over the city,
the stars glitter far away above the lights and busy traffic
while I do long for better days and back to my childhood days
and there is a gambol, music and lights that drone and hum,
young people everywhere together do laugh happily and its dark night
and when a dark figure comes nearer and my heart skips a beat,
for danger I am ready and do expect the worst
but in a black leather jacket a much older man walks past
while the eternal longing for peace and tranquillity do remain in my heart.
