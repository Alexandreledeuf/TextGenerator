(free verse) * The Doings Of McPherson
It's the fourth of July.. McPherson is cracking his knuckles and snapping his fingers
Summer is-a-cummin...McPherson has thrown out his xmas tree
McPherson thinks everyone should pay his share... He's certainly not about to.
Can you guess McPherson's favourite poetry? .... free verse
McPherson is heading for the door... it is almost his turn to pay for a round.
* free verse... prose on a poem site
(nothing personal...McPherson is a generic term for the Scots)
