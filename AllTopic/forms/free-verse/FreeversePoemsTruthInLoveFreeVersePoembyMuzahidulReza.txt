In heart, in thought, in mind
If I hope for
I love;
If I find,
I am lucky;
If in true way
I spend my short life with I love,
I am successful;
It is true love I claim
As flower it does bloom
Spreads beauty and purity
Around its branches
Then at far distance;
Raises me over wrong
Keeps me far from sin;
It knows my existence
It knows my soul,
With it I am whole
Without it I am empty,
It shows me right way,
Absolute path
Nothing after that;
It is my happiness
It is my soul's ambition
It is my soul's salvation
It is my final contentment;
For this love I will sail far
Crossing all the oceans
All the dangers
Over there;
Follow it all the loves
To make me real lover
And forever,
Come every moment
Every day
Every month
Every year
Every era,
On the way
I go pass,
Shake my right hand,
I stand,
Turn around,
I find
Love
True love;
Now I feel immortality
True love dismisses mortality
Here
And hereafter
Nor for being emotionally feat
But true at day light.
