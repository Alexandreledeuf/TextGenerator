Man loves man
Man helps, and cares of man
Man wishes and prays for man
Man does these for human betterment,
I don't negate these but say for some reasons
I see what man does well for man
Man gets that instant hand in hand.
Again, man hates, envies man,
Man is hostile to man limitlessly
Man plots against man silently or openly,
Man exercises black arts to harm man
Yet man is not satisfied; so man
Has invented modern weapons to kill man
Mainly, mercilessly, brutally and entirely,
Yet man is not satisfied; so man
Is practising the science of destruction,
To destroy all ins and outs and
To be superhuman man is practising
The science of superpower to gain all
Wasting a vast amount of wealth playfully;
When a group of people without basic needs
Are living a miserable, inferior, inhuman life.
Another group to whom wealth is subjective
Without rules and regulations living a sinful
Which is to them called a luxurious, pompous,
Carefree, heavenly, ever happy, plentiful life.
I don't deny man's well side of inventions
For those civilization has much advanced,
Again for the bad side of inventions and
The science of ruin we are losing everything,
Our beautiful world is getting unsuitable
For us and for our future generations,
The wheels of good cycle are almost stopped
And all that bad ones are geared up to speed.
May man get new ways and means to live
Rationally, peacefully, perfectly and harmlessly
Without hatred, enmity, envy for anybody
Wishing real and every triumph for humanity
To avoid sinking down into the centuries
Fathomless sea of chaos and vulnerabilities.
