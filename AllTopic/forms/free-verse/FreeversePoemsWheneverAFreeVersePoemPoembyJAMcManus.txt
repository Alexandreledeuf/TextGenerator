Whenever I hear birds singing
As I walk under tall, green trees
I shall think of you and smile
Whenever I hear a sweet wrapper
Rustling gently in the breeze
I shall remember you and smile
Whenever I long to hear the sound
Of your infectious, joyful laughter
I shall miss you always and smile.
