Free verse it must not be that easy for to write
And not very easy for one to recite
Harder by far to pen good free verse than to pen good rhyme
Which was popular going back four decades in time
So many fine poets writing in free verse to day
Into the twenty first century they lead the way
It does seem in poetry rhyme is of the past
But few things in life ever does seem to last
In literature many more changes ahead
In a few decades from now free verse may be dead
For most things upon them have a use by date
And the passage of time on few things seem to wait
Times changing faster nowadays than ever before
And only Nature herself will live forever more
