(after C. M. van der Heever)
The orange-red moon rises as if it is sailing in the sky
where the last rays of the sun do disappear
and the long row of oak trees are etched in their outlines
as if the sun is still writing its last message
before the darkness totally absorbs the last light
while blue-white the evening star do already shine
and predators hunt to survive in the death and pain of others
while crocodiles and hippopotamuses come out with their clumsy bodies
and there is a fine balance between life and death
that hangs over the whole earth like a web
while birds of prey do glide in the darkness
and like this everything in a way is caught
even man who do strive as a higher being
to noble things and also to his own interest.
