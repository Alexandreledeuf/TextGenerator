(free verse) *Strictly For The Birds
I can tell when my cat has been chasing ducks.
He has that down-in-the-mouth look.
Which birds steal soap from the bath?
Robber duckies
When vultures fly are they allowed carrion luggage?
A raven has 6 pinions on each wing
A crow has 5 pinions on each wing
So the difference is a matter of a pinion
