(free verse) *Not suitable for limericks #4
I can always tell when my wife has had enough to drink...
her face gets blurry
They say alcohol is a slow poison...
but hey!who's in a hurry?
Two nuns approach a drunk.One passes on the right
and the other passes on the left.
He whips around: "How did you do that? "
Don't drink and drive.
You're liable to hit a bump and spill your drink.
