With Love, Time is not
Nor space and distance matter
Ribboned passion in a knot
One loving heart tied with the other.
With Love,  Age is not
Nor even Status break attraction
Kings give up thrones, and all of that
For his lady love's deep affection.
With Love,  Race is  not.
For Color fades in Cupid's arrow
It conquers all,  no matter what
Blind to the sight  is what lovers know.
