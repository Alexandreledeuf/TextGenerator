Old Love
What love means to me is
a partnership of trust,
a merging of souls,
commitment a must.
It's not about ownership
or archaic vows to obey.
It's about loyalty, fidelity,
and sacrifices we make.
What love means to me is
a meeting in the middle.
Two souls functioning together,
both opposite, yet equal.
Like the motion of waves
love waxes and then wanes.
First, romance and excitment
then conpanionship gained.
What love means to me is
how you season the weather
surviving imminent tempests
then cuddling together.
Companionate love
is the ultimate goal
a love that means comfort
a love that's grown old.
what love means to me is
an assured kiss goodnight
from my best friend and lover,
on the left, to my right.
