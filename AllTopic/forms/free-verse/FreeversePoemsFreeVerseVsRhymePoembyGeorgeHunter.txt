Free Verse Version
This big ole egg named Humphrey
was perched on the top of
a high brick wall.
He fell off
It was a long way down
and he shattered his shell.
Someone call 911!
All the King's lackeys came with
a herd of emergency tech horses.
They tried to glue ole Hump
back together
but no luck.
Too many pieces
Tough grits!
Original Version
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the King's horses
And all the King's men
Couldn't put Humpty
Together again.
Now I ask you.
Which version is better?
I kinda like the first one
How about another?
This shepherdess'
name was Bo Derek Peep
called Bo for short.
Somehow she
misplaced her sheep.
She looked high and low to no avail.
She didn't know
where else to look
so she just went and
had herself a brewski
and they eventually returned on their own
to the sheepfold
and they wagged their tails
in the back.
Where else?
You know the original so
I will not repeat for you.
