Dream on with your life,
Keep dreaming because you’ll,
Never get this back,
Dream on till you can’t dream no more,
Because when your done dreaming
I won’t be there no more,
I will be long gone,
Not thinking of you,
So dream on till there are no memories left, ,
I don’t want to be caged,
My heart tells me it wants to be free,
Not locked up in one spot,
Dream on with your life,
Go find someone new,
Don’t bother with me anymore,
Because I’m long gone by now,
So Dream On.
