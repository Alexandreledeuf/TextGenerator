(for Annelize)
I adore you late at night, at daybreak and in the afternoon,
even if the days of hardship would come without an end,
even if all of life did only flower as thistles
it would do nothing to my love for you,
even if I had to reconcile myself with another person in your life,
for years you will still have me speechless
where I do love you still in my later years
as love do not set demands to fulfil,
it only leaves its own lovely tracks deep in the heart
and like the seasons nothing can stop it
where it lasts for decades and go far past the aeons,
it brings healing and happiness instead of sorrow,
it is something that do includes all great things and also hope
and with my love I want to envelope your whole world.
