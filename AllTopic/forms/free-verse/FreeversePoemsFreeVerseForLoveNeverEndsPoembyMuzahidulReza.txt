(Love Never Ends: Free Verse)
Once you love truly
Then see, never ends
In all stages of life it exists immortally;
I say, "I love, I love", if it is in heart
Happy or sad heart bears it forever;
I am here, I am there,
Nothing matters
It follows everywhere,
Every path it crosses
Even, uneven, chaotic, full of thorns
Up to reach the destination,
On the way it may be hurt
But does not get death, anyway
Like soul love is unseen
And fully immortal,
You love really
It will make you believe definitely,
After hurt it will ferment
Will get much vigor, power
Then at destination
It becomes heavenly one
And never ends.
