(after Etienne van Heerden)
As a child he was taught that the judgement day of God would come,
of angels that do hold a laager of protection around him,
where the pastor and Sabbath School of the church said
that God's territory is everywhere and limitless
and he believes that he serves the Lord sincerely and faithfully,
that God does even witness the smallest injustice on earth,
do shoot with his catapult the mynahs to death
where they peck at the other birds like demons that some feathers are lost,
do hear the babbler roaring with laughter at him
and believes that it's a message coming from God
that right and righteousness must occur everywhere
as the world is the jurisdiction of God
where the doves again sing their songs of praise,
of a God that do even to birds bring salvation.
