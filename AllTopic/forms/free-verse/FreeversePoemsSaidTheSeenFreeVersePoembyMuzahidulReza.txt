Clearly seen and truly said something
Not of nature but of human being,
Of their claiming big by brain
But showing majorly wrongs in doing;
Inventing dreadful chemicals and arms
They raise random wars to massacre,
Illegally charging any race or nation
Dishonor, murder and destroy to finish;
These are some fatal signs of being
Fool in abusing but wise in nothing,
Committing injustice, crimes, corruption
Being really hypocrite show outwardly fit.
