(free verse)* Not Suitable For Limericks #2
Today's children might be less spoiled if we could
spank their parents
I'm as confused as a baby in a topless bar
You should never put a child in Superman
pajamas in a top bunk
For good... return good
For evil... call Batman
* (free verse... prose on a poem site)
