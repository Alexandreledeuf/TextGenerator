Ah yes, Vietnam
Remember it well
Just eighteen
Not more than a lad
Like the rest
Serving my country
Counting my days
Ah yes, remembering
The ladies of the night
And the 'GI Refrain'
Known far and wide
'I love you too much''
'What's your name? '
Rows of bars
Nameless streets
Just ships
Passing in the night
Body counts
Taking ears
American bodies burn so bright
Plenty of booze
Drown the pain
I just want to hear
That 'GI Refrain'
'I love you too much',
'What's your name? '
