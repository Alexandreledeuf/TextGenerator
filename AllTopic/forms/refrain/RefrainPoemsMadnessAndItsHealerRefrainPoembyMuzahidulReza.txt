Madness And Its Healer (Refrain)
22 November, 2018
Madness is now on and up
With headache it's so tough!
To be healthy, in fact
For madness so difficult!
The mad let not well one do
Lead life being healthy, too
For them the society has been
Peaceless and full of dustbin;
Now to heal this madness
Need some mental fitness,
Lack of this fitness
At high speed going on madness.
