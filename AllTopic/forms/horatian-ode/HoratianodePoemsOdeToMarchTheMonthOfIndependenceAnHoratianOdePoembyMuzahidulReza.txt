(Ode To March, The Month Of Independence - An Horatian Ode)
March, again you have come
Holding the history from 1971,
To remind the oblivious generation
How our ancestors fought then
Against oppressors, occupationists
Armed, fully cruel massacrers
Massacred lots of common mass,
Dishonored woman folks a lots,
Destroyed innumerable properties,
So every year you come to see us, March.
