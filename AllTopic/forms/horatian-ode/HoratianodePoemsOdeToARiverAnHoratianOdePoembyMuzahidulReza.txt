(An Horatian Ode: To A River)
O, river! You are flowing forever
Originating from that of mountains
Run through even, uneven, desert; for
Hurrying and rushing to the oceans
Your ways are done zigzag, mysterious
And chaotic to the simple people,
But they are for lifelong hopeful to you
For the blessing you bestow them always,
Your water to them very essential,
Fishes you bear are very precious, too.
