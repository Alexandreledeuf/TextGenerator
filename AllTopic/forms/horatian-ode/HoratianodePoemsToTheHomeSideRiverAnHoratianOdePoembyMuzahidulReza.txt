(An Horatian Ode To The Home Side River)
O, river, my home tune singing river
I like and love thee more than spring
Whatever thou think of me no matter
Spring does a little to me beautifying;
Thou flow water through thine bed
Wash away all the manmade wastes
Sitting on thee sometimes I think,
Thou so dearly do for the farmers' field
Thou have been my one of the intimates
Causing a connection by an unseen link.
