Almost just like the first time we did kiss
you went to the bedroom and closed the door,
as if with each other it did not happen before
we were catching up on the time we did miss,
the yearning we could simply not dismiss,
lucidly as if destined we did each other adore,
our love wanted satisfaction and much more,
it was much more and deeper than mere bliss,
our nakedness was almost sacred and holy
where we did each other touch with tenderness,
but the sheer intensity of it took us by storm,
it was something jubilant without melancholy,
that we did absolutely satisfy our covetousness
and against me you were passionate and warm.
