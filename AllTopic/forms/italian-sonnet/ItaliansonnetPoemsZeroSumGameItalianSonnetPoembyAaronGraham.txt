No more shall elms sleep: their ageless sentience
Slows scenes; wisdom’s eternal ecliptic
Brink of man’s mortal event horizon
Resolves: Catharsis of life’s macabre dance
Poets pen scribes a dirge: love is romance
Tyrant’s test: time’s decree, prides defiance.
a Three-faced, ethereal muse: recourse for
Kings’ desire. Offer legions on its pyre
Men sought t’pass time’s end: found themselves no more:
Their derelict rhetoric litter Styx‘s shore,
Faster had Ramses built an interstate
Than Shelly’s hand mockd’: laws of time and fate
Even pedestalled warnings, men ignore
Chides Charon, who tongues his Marlboro, and waits.
