As if these moments caught each emotion
where the tender passion of a single kiss
was something that will never again be like this
that came purely without any instigation,
that does at times return by own volition
as if all meaning of how true love really is,
was built into mere moments of pure bliss
as if leading to this was every other motion
and my mind, heart and body cannot ever forget
as if that way of love was burnt in to all of me,
in the translucence of how with you it had been
where the intimate loving came long after we had met
in mere moments did become the sweetest memory
of your skin, intimate touch as sacred and clean.
