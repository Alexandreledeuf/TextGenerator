(in answer to Elizabeth Barrett Browning)
Beloved girl, it is very strange to think
that you who I love, a short time ago,
I did then not even really deeply know
and now we have this ultimate link,
and I cannot put the right words in ink,
I see your lovely face, your body glow,
you are perfect like tiny drops of snow,
from your essence continually I drink.
You are making my life wonderful,
with great joy in the day and night
while of every moment I am aware,
with you my spirit is abundantly full
in your presence I do constantly delight
and you do treat me with tender care.
