As a prince He gave up His Godly life
when man to temptation in sin did fall,
did come right into the middle of it all,
did in poverty as a mere baby arrive
and did not even have a house or a wife.
In my mind and heart He still walks tall,
do not force His ways and truth but does call,
does help in my own turmoil and strive
and He taught the essence of selfless sincere love
but mentioning Him nowadays makes people angry
where believing in Him is out line and I find this odd,
where He does men from evil to great goodness move,
where daily He sets me free and His love does fill me
and His grace and mercy urges me to honor Him as God.
