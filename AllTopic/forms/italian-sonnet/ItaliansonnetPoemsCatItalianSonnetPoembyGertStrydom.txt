(After John Keats)
Cat, past your prime you do your little body lick.
How many birds have you caught in your days?
In vain you do so very innocently at me now gaze,
with amber eyes, in vain you do your ears prick.
Into how many rats did you your talons stick?
A gentle mew you do now in innocence raise
but I want you to tell me about all your frays
about every fish, mice, rat, dove and chick
but you look away begin licking your writs
seem for a brave fighting beast so very small
like a innocent boy's pet and to him just a toy
but my words let you draw your paws like fits,
it's evident that for females you did others maul,
did every little pest that you came upon destroy.
