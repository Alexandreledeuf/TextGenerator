Maybe as the sweetest in life in all,
your sincere love stands totally alone,
its impact and acts are forever known:
I am as prehistoric Adam after the fall,
where the intimate details I can recall.
Daily your character to me is shown
before God you and I stand on our own.
In the mind this can be great or small
that as a person you do me complete,
its as if life by this event gets its mark
as adults we together tread on this earth
while our experiences do remain sweet
as we do on the things of living embark
in coming times of happiness and mirth.
