Who Knows Maybe Jesus Christ Was The Rod   (Italian Sonnet)
There are many religions on this Earth
How does one know which religion to choose
Some know when they have nothing left to lose
I believe that I have known since my birth
Many are filled with happiness and mirth
Some rich worship with prostitutes and booze
I’ve chosen the religion of the Jews
At times I know not how much that is worth
I guess some may say that I’m a Christian
I don’t I say that I’m a Son of God
I’ll not have another God before him
Some worship Christ I feel this is a sin
Who knows maybe Jesus Christ was The Rod
But if I’m The Branch things are looking dim
