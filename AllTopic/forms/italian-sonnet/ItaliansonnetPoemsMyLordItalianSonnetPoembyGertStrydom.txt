long before I came to life
in Your thoughts was all of me,
You did even see my iniquity
where I do fit in, in a world of strife.
You formed me, gave the spark to make me alive
knew before I was what I was going to be,
prepared me through many years for my duty,
even knew before me about my wife
my knowledge, my skills, my talent and art
came from where you did guide
while wonderful I was made into my own person,
while you did love me with a selfless heart.
In my own heart daily you do dwell inside
and you love just goes on and on.
