(For my wife Daleen)
Love takes you to places where you had not been before
and this is how I want every new tomorrow to be with you,
the essence of selflessness is in every thing we say and do
while love does keep on asking for more and much more,
brings peace and joy to a world filled with pain and gore
and at times I know that your feelings for me are true,
while with hope and faith we pass this world through,
while I see something special in you who I do adore
but then no words can truly define a thing that passes death
where in you and your happiness my self I do constantly loose,
where I love you in your noble modest sincere and lonely ways.
Even when you bring heartache your name is on my last breath,
this principle is in the heart and is not something that I choose
where God has destined you in His grace in all of my days.
