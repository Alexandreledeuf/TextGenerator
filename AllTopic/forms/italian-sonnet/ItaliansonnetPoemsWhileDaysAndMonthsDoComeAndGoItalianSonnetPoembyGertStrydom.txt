(after Arthur Symons)
While days and months do come and go,
the memories of you do forever remain
and you are deep in my heart and brain,
intimate and wonderful I do you know,
as if with you God did a true blessing bestow
and when I am in loneliness and I am in pain,
I do think of you and of us again and again,
while my busy days do rush to and thro,
that your lips do find a way to my heart,
with the kind of essence that in a kiss is,
where your true love I want to capture
and even when we are separate and apart,
you do bring me life and you bring me bliss
while in my thoughts you do me enrapture
