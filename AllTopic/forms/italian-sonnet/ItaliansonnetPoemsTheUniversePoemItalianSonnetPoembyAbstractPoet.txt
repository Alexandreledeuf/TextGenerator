I have learn my plants in school in
science class learning all nine plants by name
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Unranus, Neptune,
Pluto I have learn about the sun, the
moon and the stars in science class did
you know there is more plants out in
the universe floating in one place? they would
like to join in the rest of nine
plants blending in even though it
would off balance the universe so
they are left to fload in
the universe all by itself floating
with the rest of the plants
out there together in one place.
