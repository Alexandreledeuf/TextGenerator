(For Daleen)
While locked-down from you I am away
a deadly virus is going through the land
and now nothing is as we have planned
and longing away from me you do stay
and it's another cold sombre winter's day
where I do wish to take you by the hand,
wish you my sincere love to understand
and daily for protection for you I do pray,
I believe the virus will be away in a while
while thousands do over loved ones grieve,
only do remember the times that they had
and in my mind's eye I still see you smile
as happy on your daily duties you do leave
to bring some joy to a world that is very sad.
[Poet's note: The seasons in the Southern Hemisphere of the earth are opposite to those in the Northern Hemisphere.]
