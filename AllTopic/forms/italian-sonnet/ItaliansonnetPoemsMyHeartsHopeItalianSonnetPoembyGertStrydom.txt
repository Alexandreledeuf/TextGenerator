(after Dante Gabriel Rossetti)
What words will I use what paths find that are not upon trod
to you and our true love to find and then to experience and explore
while poetry as song yield up in your heart as a wave do to a shore
or like Israel of old find a new red-sea to pass through dry-shod.
Where we are separate and that I love you still might to you be odd
but love is something that is a principle and in essence stays forevermore
where daily I find that it has something more and deeper in store
while what it is and how it comes and its essence is from God.
In the name of God, of our love and truth would I
find for you of our love and what is right the evidence
that which to all other love do still strongly signify
that my love is true and real and like fire very intense
while it still stands as days, months and years go by
as much more than just a desire or lasting sense.
