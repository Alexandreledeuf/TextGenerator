With the warmth of the heart, with light,
she wants to fill my world she tells me
and in the depths of her eyes I see
promises of all the things that might
be waiting as if great things are in sight
and very happy I want her to be,
from all fear, sadness and despair free
and our future I want to be bright
as she is the shining one who wants much more,
that draws all of my attention, talks about respect
and I look at her and see the angel of my heart,
do realise that from the start her I do adore
while I do not know what to expect
as loving her is a kind of unknown art.
