Even when the shadows increase
on this lovely sunny summer day
nothing can sweep our feelings away
and its something that never cease
the power of love does only increase,
its presence is without any decay
and your dear face do portray
its impact, its caring and its peace
its something powerful passionate
yet at times it's wise and meek
and it takes many a guise in gentleness
while actions do its presence indicate
and continually people does it seek
as it can forget and forgive in its genuineness.
