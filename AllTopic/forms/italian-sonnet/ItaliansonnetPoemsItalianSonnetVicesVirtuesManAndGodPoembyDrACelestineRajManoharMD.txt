The good we do are fewer than the bad;
The bad we do becomes a habit fast;
Our vices seem a mountain of the past;
Alas! Adults thus grow from lass and lad.
The modern world can make us almost mad;
In sin and problems, we are always cast;
The past can look so awry and aghast;
Our fewer virtues only make us glad.
Yet, God is patient with our trespasses;
Our loving God is merciful to core;
His heart of kindness rains on us His grace;
He knows the heart of man has weaknesses;
To sinners, He opens a newer door;
He loves all souls He made and must embrace!
