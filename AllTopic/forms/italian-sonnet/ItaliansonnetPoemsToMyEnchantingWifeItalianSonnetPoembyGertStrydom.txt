(in answer to Anne Bradstreet)
If ever a man knew with every feeling and sense
that he was adored, trusted, respected sincerely
then that is the very way that you do love me
without expecting but honesty as recompense.
If ever experiences have been past intense
while interaction came by selfless liberty
and a woman made a man to be very happy
then such love is immeasurable immense
and that is the way that with you my love is.
If ever a woman was to pure principles true
but knew her husband to his very heart
with magic in every kiss and pure bliss,
then that is the aspects that I find in you
where of me you are the very best part.
