With you life feels like its running to eternity
and each day with you I want to be just like this
and I know you in times of heartache and bliss
where you are far more than just dear to me
and however our days are going to be,
even if we do argue make up and kiss
when you are away I do you truly miss.
In this life you are my living sanctuary,
the one, who with everything I do trust,
do know in days of happiness and pain
and there is something special to loving you,
even if to circumstance we have to adjust,
you are with me in both sunshine and rain,
in all the things that you do say and do.
