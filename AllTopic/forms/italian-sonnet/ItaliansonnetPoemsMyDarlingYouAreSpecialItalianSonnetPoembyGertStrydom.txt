(after Christina Rossetti)
My darling, you are special and precious to me
I daily do pray for God to constantly accompany you
and to keep our love as a principle strong and true
where it is something of substance that comes free
and where we cannot the future or destiny foresee
that intact our love will stay even if our days are blue
where constantly I think of you in everything that I do
where He changes the way as to us it ought to be
where you are my companion, my lover and dear friend
whilst I love you as a man in all the ways that he can,
I wish to love you each day in a special way much more
where this thing between us is something without an end
that does our time and both our lives to the very limit span
where from the depth of my heart and principle I do you adore.
