God knows exactly what brings
us pain, fear, happiness and bliss
and He is present in a time like this,
He is aware of all kinds of things.
About him each bird daily sings
and not a single thing He does miss,
loss and pain He does not dismiss,
knows when destiny a deadly thing flings
and in deadly situations He is still in control,
He knows all the answers to every situation,
do self-sacrificing act with the greatest grace,
He makes broken people again to be whole
do dismiss every false kind of accusation
and His love do me constantly amaze
