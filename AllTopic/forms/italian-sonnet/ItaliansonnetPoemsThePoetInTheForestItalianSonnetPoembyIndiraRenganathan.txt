Gone into the forest the poet felt
A weird silence and a hushing whisper
In roaring threat that feared his move further
Somehow bold and brave he watchful on went
There was beauty everywhere all well dealt
'But wild in weird silence-  who that maker? '
The poet asked aloud in great wonder
'Is there a God special for the forest? '
He smelt a war of strife, a hell of freeze
As well a music of harmony donned
Hell and heaven in thick friendship he saw
But then the forest said with all its weaves
'To reach the heaven cross the hell pardoned
O' poet, hell is the checkpoint, mind yaw'
