(after Dante Gabriel Rossetti)
Suddenly I know that right here I have been before
but of this place and when there is no knowledge to tell,
it's as if right now I am under an ancient kind of spell,
where outside waves are lapping at the rocky shore
and something tells me, reminds me, here I was in times of yore,
where in my heart and soul and mind I know your smell,
where you smile to me in a way, as you do know me very well,
where it is clear that you do me intensely adore,
on an old table a candle does shadows throw where it does glow
you lead me to the bed as if it's something we are doing again,
your neck like that, your back and naked body bend just so,
where like a thousand times before with you I have lain,
while you do me extremely well and intimately know,
while we love, live and exist without any kind of pain.
