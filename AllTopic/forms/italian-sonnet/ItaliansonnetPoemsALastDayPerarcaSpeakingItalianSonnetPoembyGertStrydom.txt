(in answer to Joan Hambidge)
When we came with each other face to face
you were past all other expectations to me,
as no other lovely woman had your sincerity,
I was speechless with your beauty and grace
but then destiny tried our lives to erase
in a way that we did not want life to be
but through this our love still stayed free,
no tears could your love disguise or deface.
Before all of this I saw you in my own Avignon,
like Petrarca thought your presence into my life
and I can write poems like him but do remain true,
I pray you into my days while you are gone,
where your eyes roam in my mind, my wife,
and to others unusual, in my heart it's only you.
