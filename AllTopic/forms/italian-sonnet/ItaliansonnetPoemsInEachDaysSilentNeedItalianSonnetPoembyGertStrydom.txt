In each day's silent need
I do love you to the capacity
that the love of a man for a woman could be
and in every word and deed
far past the utmost places where feelings go, indeed,
far past earthly yearnings with sagacity
you are far more than just dear to me
and I love you with a child's kind of creed
with the kind of hope and faith that you
do notice that with every breath
and every thing that is in my might,
in all the things that I say and do,
even beyond the limitations of death,
I do love you even when all things are out of sight.
