Through years I came to know your lovely ways,
you fill my heart to its breadth, depth and height.
Many little things you do and say are out of sight
while you do act in solitude with innocent grace,
bringing emotions sweet and serene to every day's
silent need, whether I find you by day or at night,
in times of real pain and in times of sheer delight
as you go on your needful way with little praise,
do put your wit and temperate will to good use,
as you do go through life with reason and hope
experiencing blame, smiles, praise and tears
acting daily as if you do have nothing to lose
and at times of great distress you do still cope
while you trust in God and live without fears.
