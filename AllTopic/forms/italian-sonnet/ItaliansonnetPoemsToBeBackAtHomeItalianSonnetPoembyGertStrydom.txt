To be back at home
while the lovely spring leads the summer on
when the last traces of the cold winter is gone,
when a brilliant blue is the day's dome
when happily the insects and birds do roam,
when not a single thing is lonesome
to me you are the only one
while the months and years do come
while in a flash the happy times pass
and fruitfulness is everywhere
when love has truly found a dwelling place
while nothing stays just as it was
when times seems to be without a care
then our love is divine, sacred, a Godly grace.
