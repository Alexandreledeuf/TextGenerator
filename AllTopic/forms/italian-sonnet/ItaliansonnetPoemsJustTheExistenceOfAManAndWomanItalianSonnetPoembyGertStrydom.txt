You lie bent and spooned very cosily against me,
do tightly hug the white sheet and the one duvet
where comfortable in your deepest sleep you lay
From all of the other bedding you are totally free,
you sleep drawn open, naked, with your face happy
while now and then something incoherent you do say
outside it is silent as the nearest neighbours are away
I find you and the same expression on your face I see.
On the bed the blankets and sheets in a heap is tangled
I hear the house creak as a car pass with its bright lights.
The doves in the oak tree outside do sing a love song
there is no change and our life is not new-fangled
just the existence of a man and woman in days and nights
where in this life it does feel that together we do belong.
