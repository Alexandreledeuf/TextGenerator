The Son of God who became a human being
did walk upon the water of the Sea of Galilee,
when He came to set all men free
from sin and His love still is something amazing
and when I hear the birds sing their praises in spring
then I see the One who made things like they are supposed to be
and the humiliation of that dark Calvary does stay with me
as humanityâ€™s most terrible crushing thing
but although the Prince does not walk on this earth anymore
He still at times comes visiting in disguise
and when a poor beggar knocks at the door
I do some great caution exercise
as Jesus does change lives from what they have been before
and in that wretched man the Lord God I might just recognize.
