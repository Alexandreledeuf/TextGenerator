There are times that I pray
for those that I love and know
and sometimes the words just flow
and at other times I have got nothing to say
and on every single day
God does His goodwill bestow
and with compassion my words do sometimes glow
or they are swept away
like leaves blown in the wind
and sometimes some thoughts do remain
when some problems to me are too much
but before I know it I do find
happiness instead of pain
when God do lives silently touch.
