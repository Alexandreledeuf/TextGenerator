Invisible but yet right here Your power
is working where in secret it's visiting
doing its actions in this early time of spring
and very slowly in secret hour by hour
it brings the awakening to every flower,
give to the birds a joy, which they do sing
while at the core of things You are caring
and in all this I am just an observant follower
and transitory like all living things on this earth
is the loveliness of the wild flowers in the veldt
and not from demon kind but by Your hand
where you do care into fine detail from birth
and in Your omnipotent hand everything is held
while beyond the realm of time you do stand.
