Thank God I Don't Worry About The Dow   (Italian Sonnet)
I have been writing poetry for years
Yet it still seems that I can't get it right
Thinking of poems keeps me up at night
These thoughts are the root of all of my fears
Who's are these strange voices that fill my ears
I long for those days when I flew my kite
When I shunned the dark and walked in the light
Long forgotten days that were filled with cheer
If I knew then half of what I know now
I do believe that I would still be poor
Although I don't think that I'd be in debt
Thank God I don't worry about the Dow
Or the constant hunger of wanting more
Always getting everything I could get
