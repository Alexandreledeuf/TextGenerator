As if it\s a great unending adventure,
daily we search for life's essence,
do not realise that we are in God's presence
where He does our imperfections endure.
About tomorrow we are not very sure
where we fabricate our own pretence,
at times run into other's incompetence
while life with its excitement does us allure
and most important become our appearance
but much more than this we do experience
that which we think makes life very great,
as if to the future we have forbearance
but to a deadly thing we have inexperience
and on God's omnipotence we do wait.
