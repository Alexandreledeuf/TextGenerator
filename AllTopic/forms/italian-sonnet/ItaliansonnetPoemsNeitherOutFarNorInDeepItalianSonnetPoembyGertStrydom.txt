(in answer to Robert Frost)
Whether it is in spring, summer, winter or fall
you will find people at the beach on the sand,
where in groups or single they lay, sit or stand,
from a distance the sea is huge and they are small,
although they do not look far it does not matter at all
where they turn their backs to the city and to the land
are joyful all over the beach, alone or a small band,
and some are tiny, others are fat and some are tall
where the sea lies before them flat as gleaming glass
some hold company, talk and look from the beach
while others ride the foaming waves to the shore
while in the distance a white sailboat sails pass
from the cool water some do stay out of reach
while others do the sea and everything in it adore.
