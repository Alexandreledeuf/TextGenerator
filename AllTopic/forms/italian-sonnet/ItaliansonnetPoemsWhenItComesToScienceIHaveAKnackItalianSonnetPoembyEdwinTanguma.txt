When It Comes To Science I Have A Knack   (Italian Sonnet)
I don't think that I am a scientist
Yet there are some who may think that I am
And others may believe I am a sham
It does not matter I will not get pissed
I think I'll try to get down to the gist
Because I really do not give a damn
Everyone knows that I am not the Lamb
When it comes to writing I've not shown wist
Will we have a palladium fuel cell
Or hydrogen peroxide as a fuel
It is big business that is holding us back
I don't think that my life is a living hell
Electromagnetic fission is cool
When it comes to science I have a knack
