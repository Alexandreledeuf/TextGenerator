Many Are Slaves Without Knowing Their Plight   (Italian Sonnet)
We walk through our lives with our blinders on
Oblivious to the things around us
We do what we’re told without any fuss
Like a good obedient little pawn
When we were young we played games on the lawn
For our lives were nothing more than a muss
And we we’re barely learning how to cuss
It’s a miracle we still rose at dawn
As we grew older we began to see
And we gained the knowledge of wrong and right
We continued to search for our life’s key
Some people lay down while others will fight
For some have learned we are not truly free
Many are slaves without knowing their plight
