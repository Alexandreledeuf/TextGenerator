You are the word that is all life,
who spoke at the very origin
who caused all things to begin
in a perfect way without any strife.
You made everything that is alive,
even when Lucifer came with sin,
self-sacrificing You did that battle win,
did forgive Adam and his lovely wife
and yet today mere men do You betray,
they do act and speak as if You do not exist
as if a god each one is without conscience
and yet still today Your way is the best way
but to follow their own will they do insist,
do find the answers to all things in science.
