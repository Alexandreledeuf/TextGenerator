Gay the hot sunny summer day does begin
where yesterday was filled with rain and pain
and in the past it and its hardships do remain
where today and in the future you do enter in
and this love is so great that it does feel like sin
where I cannot wait to see you once again
where you are near even in my days of rain
where against hardship we both dare to win
outside the weaver chatters while it builds a nest,
the turtledoves flutter down while they coo,
the black-collard barbet does call for its mate
and with you in my life I am truly blest
where our love is always constant and true
and it's a hell of a thing to live separate.
