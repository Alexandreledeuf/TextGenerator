In some ways the world we live in
is no different from the world in Christâ€™s day.
Today just like in the time of Rome people dance and play
and chase after pleasure and sin,
try at almost any cost to win,
do each other mock and betray,
are set on monetary value come what may
and without thought with the next evil we do begin
while some people live by human laws,
believe that the word of God is an outmoded tale
and do make own specific rules
as if an omnipotent God is full of flaws
and yet in life they do not prevail
while they act like renegades and self centred fools.
