(for Annelize)
From the depth of my heart I do you truly know,
the people that do you slander I want to smother,
that as a person you do move me like no other,
that with you God did His goodwill on me bestow
when you came to me in a life full of woe
while people did me severally bother,
I do long for the two of us to be together
and for you my heart do with passion glow
together with you I do want to live well
and although at a time there had been tears
through decades I do you adore,
to you daily of my love I will tell
I want to be with you through the years
as I love you much more than before.
