When the world comes to the end of its days
What will happen to all of those in it
Will all of them be tossed into the pit
For not listening to all that God says
His flock is divided and filled with strays
At times I hope they all get what they get
Most people in this world don’t give a s_ _ _
Greedy and corrupt they’re set in their ways
Mankind is so vain in all that they do
And enough is never enough for them
In their hearts they feel I’m better than you
How many of you feel that this is true
I will go on and continue to swim
Easter is vanity that is my view
