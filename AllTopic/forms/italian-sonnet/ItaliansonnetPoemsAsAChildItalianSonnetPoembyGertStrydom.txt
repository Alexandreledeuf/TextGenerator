As a child every single thing in my sight:
the earth, the hillock, the dale and the stream
was untouched by pain and everything did seem
was touched by the divine, as if by a divine light,
enchanting full of stars was the sky by night,
the moon in its magical soft silver beam,
where now it all seems only like a dream
where the entire world is full of fear and fright
and I wish the world were as it was before
that back to that time I could change everything
could look at the world with a child's hope and faith
but now in adulthood that world does exist no more
and yet still the birds do outside happily sing
but in my country no one is from hardship safe.
