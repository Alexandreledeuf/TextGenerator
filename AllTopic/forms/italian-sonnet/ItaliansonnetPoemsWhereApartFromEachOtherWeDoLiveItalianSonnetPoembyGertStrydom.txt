On the phone this morning I did your voice hear
where apart from each other we do live
and to you I want my heartfelt wishes give,
come to you with joy an no kind of fear
with only tranquillity and happiness and no drear
like a child in your love hope and truly believe
where I do this longing of the years grieve
and wish that you could be constantly near
where for decade we both have happiness sought
do of every gentle kindness approve
but with destiny life is not as it aught
but still through many years you do me move
and we are both by our lives caught
but yet forever we are in love.
