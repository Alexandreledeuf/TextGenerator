For She Is My Queen And I Am Her Queen   (Italian Sonnet) ?
I will love my wife 'til the day I die
For she is my queen and I am her king
I even bought her a large diamond ring
She gives me the strength and courage to try
Without her I would be a lousy guy
If I could I'd write her a song and sing
It would not be about my ding a ling
I would write about love that is no lie
Before we met I would only prospect
Oh how much simpler the times were then
'Twas before she joined a religious group
Some call them the Jehovah Witness sect
I gave up my pick and picked up my pen
And write poetry some consider poop
