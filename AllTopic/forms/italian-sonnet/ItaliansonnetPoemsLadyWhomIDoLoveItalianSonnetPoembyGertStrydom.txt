(for Daleen)
To you in body, soul, spirit and heart I am knit,
an inner tranquillity through your eyes does shine.
When I am away from you my heart does pine,
in sincerity I do bring the absolute truth in wit:
where a lack of income may barely make it,
only faithful labour and duty to you is mine,
where by acts and words I do my duty define
and all of this does into the way love is fit.
While to this very day I do truly love you,
of your selfless humanity I do truly know,
of our true relationship in every aspect
where love is in what you do say and do.
To me in every word and act you are true
with a kind of understanding and respect.
