(for Annelize)
We do live our lives so very discreet
yet my heart is filled with thoughts of you
and my feelings are sincere and true
with the memories of when we do meet
where you are decisive and very sweet,
do understand me, all the things that I do,
while in life the same things we do pursue
and at times I lay my feelings at your feet
yet a thousand miles we do live apart
where daily I do you really deeply miss
while different lives we both do live
and you are in my soul and in my heart
while a very strange kind of life is this
where only the best to you I want to give.
