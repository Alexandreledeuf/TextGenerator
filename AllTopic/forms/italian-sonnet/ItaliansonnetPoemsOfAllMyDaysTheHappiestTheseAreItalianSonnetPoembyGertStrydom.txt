At a time you were distant like a star
while destiny did its way with me run,
where my life in its trickery was spun,
while true I did love you from afar.
Of all my days the happiest these are,
where the pain of yesterday is undone
and you are of women the loveliest one,
while no one can my humble words bar
while I follow you in all of your ways,
memories flood my mind from the past,
they are full of joy and not of pain
and now in the high summer of our days,
you are with me and I with you at last,
while only the beautiful things do remain.
