So very subtle and so very cunningly
with eyes shining like that of a sprite
you crept into my heart during the night,
your smile, your eyes and personality,
your pure body enchanting came to me
and by gentle loving and not by might,
you did caused me to fall in love to write
of a creature that is mine, who is free
an angelic being that loves me more
with flaming passion full of blazing fire,
who makes me wanting to live and to die
as my heart is smitten just as before
and when at night we together do retire
I am blessed as in my arms you lie.
