Come fall we lie in Autumn leaves
Under the rambling gust that blows
It fans the fervour like arrow bows.
A scorching kiss my lips receives
As passion unsnaps the shirt sleeves
A bouquet of love subdues the nose
Hot climax springs from head to toes
A tapestry the weak thread weaves.
The silky gossamer which binds
Hangs on the wall in full display
Stained by the red of roses and wine
As autumn leaves fade into gray
And age drifts hopelessly in line
The whirlwind takes our hearts away.
