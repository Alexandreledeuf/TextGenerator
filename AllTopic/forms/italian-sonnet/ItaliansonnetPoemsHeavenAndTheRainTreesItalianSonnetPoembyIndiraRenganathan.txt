Rain trees, rain trees, all grown tall and wide spread
Everywhere here likely to reach heaven
Resting many in their shady haven
Are cars and dogs as if it's their homestead
Scorching sun is tanning people sweated
They too run to the trees'shady haven
Rain trees rain trees grown to fetch the heaven
Along the streets and streets tall and wide spread
I rush to the terrace to watch their task
Oh I see rain trees, rain trees everywhere
Umbrellas of pinky florescence bask
Surprised at their blooming blossoms I ask
'Yourselves make the heaven o'nature's flair
Why then need you bring the heaven and task
