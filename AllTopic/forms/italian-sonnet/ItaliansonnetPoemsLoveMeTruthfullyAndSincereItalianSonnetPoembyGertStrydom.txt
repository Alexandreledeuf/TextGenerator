Love me truthfully and sincere for nought
but the essence, the principle of what love is,
even if desire comes in rapture and in bliss,
let there between us be more in each thought,
than just that which together has us brought
and let each single sweet lingering hot kiss,
be filled with respect and honour and be like this,
without change be in how our true love is wrought,
while with childish hope and God's true grace
we do each other seek in life's intimate need,
where ourselves we do in each other daily loose,
adore each other without argument face to face,
do uplift in each pleasant caring word and deed,
do constantly in life God and each other choose.
