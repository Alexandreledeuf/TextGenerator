In struggle, heartache and tranquility,
through a life of righteousness and sin
my best and worst days you do enter in
and with you I am bound and I am free.
You imperfections do fit you perfectly
and it does not matter if I loose or win,
fall to my knees and again do begin
as long as you do sincerely love me.
As the days, months and weeks go by
more beautiful to me you do become,
we do forget and forgive by God's grace
and there is much more to the you and I
as our days are happy and troublesome,
as together we do life's challenges face.
