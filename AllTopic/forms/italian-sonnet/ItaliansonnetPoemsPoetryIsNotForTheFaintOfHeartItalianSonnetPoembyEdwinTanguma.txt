Poetry Is Not For The Faint Of Heart   (Italian Sonnet)
Poetry is not for the faint of heart
Its filled with metaphors and similes
Many poems are even filled with trees
Poetry at its best is a fine art
Certain poetic forms are hard to start
Some poems mention the birds and the bees
I've even written about dogs and fleas
Which came first the wheelbarrow or the cart
I'll write poems until the day I die
Yet who knows what content they will contain
One thing is certain only time will tell
Some of my poems stink I will not lie
Others may even be considered vain
And Dante wrote about a place called hell
