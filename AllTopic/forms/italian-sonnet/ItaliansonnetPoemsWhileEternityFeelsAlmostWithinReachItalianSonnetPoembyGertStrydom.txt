While eternity feels almost in reach,
second after second life does ebb away
as a deadly virus now daily is at play,
do us of nature's mercilessness teach
where face to face and each to each
dear things we do to one another say.
Locked-down with you I cannot stay.
I remember our holiday on the beach
where life seemed so simple and free
and happiness and bliss was a part of it
as living was present in all we did see
while we experienced joy bit by tiny bit
and still right now you are dear to me
where these days do into God's plan fit.
