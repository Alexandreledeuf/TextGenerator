After All My Wife Is My Greatest Find   (Italian Sonnet)
Today the doctor gave me the green light
Too return to my favorite hobby
This poem may sound a little snobby
Can a person go prospecting at night
I must watch out for those big bugs that bite
They look like wasps but sting like bumble bees
I know that prospecting could set me free
Yet with poetry I can fly my kite
At times I wonder which one should I choose
Will it be poetry or prospecting
I hope that one day I'll make up my mind
In the end will I win or will I lose
Maybe I could give my wife a new ring
After all my wife is my greatest find
