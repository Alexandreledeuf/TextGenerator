For years while I d did on God's salvation wait
from racism, cringing and envy I was set free
while life did not turn out how I wanted it to be.
Where churchmen did me as insubordinate berate,
you saw me as significant, important and as great,
while I was unemployed you did a future in me see
and in this life you became so very dear to me
were my companion, wife and my intimate mate.
I saw patriotism take its toll and the poor and rich
living life and some people struggling to survive
that life is not paradise but what you do make of it,
and now we live in futuristic times for which
we did not plan to struggle between death and life
and still so very closely you do into my heart fit.
