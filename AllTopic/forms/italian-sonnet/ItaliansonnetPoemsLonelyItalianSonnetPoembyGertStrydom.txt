(after William Bloke Modisane)
When I am so very lonely I do think of you only,
while in my heart the sadness wants to scream
and your intimate voice I hear in every dream,
as you do constantly remain so very dear to me.
but in life from each other we are apart and free
where my life and world is not what it might seem,
and the fear of losing you rises in me like steam
while with you I need to find peace and tranquillity
my voice echoes down life's abandoned alley
where only you can my heart's painful yells hear
while the echoes go far to where you are
as if the sound finds you stuck away in some abbey
where of loosing you completely I do fear
where from me at times you are so very far.
