While time carried on in its unperturbed ticking pace
the knowledge of just how our live together will be
in the mind, the heart and flesh touched you and me,
deep in my heart lived the image of your kind face,
by the Lord's love and ever abundant kind of grace
ever present like in a shell the sound of the stormy sea,
untamed unperturbed our love was always free
nothing could its impact or its traces ever erase:
I loved you through the nights and through the days,
loved you true through all seasons and the years,
I loved you while I was weak and while I was strong,
loved you in the labyrinth of so many different ways,
knew you in my pleasure, pain, joy and in my tears
and I adored you while together our lives went along.
