In the dark expanse of nothing You are the light,
Your thoughts and words do create everything.
From eternity You are the only existing being
where You are always present but out of sight.
The many twinkling, glowing stars in the night
are constantly in their orbits in space moving
in the way that You had set from the beginning,
where You do create and maintain to Your delight
destine the things that do come to us in our days,
where You do know exactly the things that will be
do dwell in out thought, minds and in every heart
sanction how we mortals experience Your ways,
do eternally walk the pathways of immortality
where the universe is your canvas and your art.
