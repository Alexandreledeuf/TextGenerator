I wish that I could clearly recall the day
the exact moment, the instant that we did meet
but it runs away like something with ever moving feet
as if the emotions between us are ever at play
and now I cannot really clearly say
what had happened but that moment was sweet,
each other we did pleasantly greet
and although that time had slipped away
to both of us later it meant so much
and at the times when we are apart
nothing can our true love remove
and its impact lingers in each touch
are in each glance like a silent kind of art
which does its sweet presence prove.
