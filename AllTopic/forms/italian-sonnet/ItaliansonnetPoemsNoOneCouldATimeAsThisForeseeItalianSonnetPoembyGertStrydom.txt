No one could a time just as this one foresee
where during a lock-down I would miss you so,
are by government restricted to you to go,
where from this virus there is nowhere to flee
while for a time you are away from me
and time passes so infinitely slow
while of your true love I do know,
as if by destiny it is meant to be
that in the world a deadly thing is at play
and chinamen unmoved as if unknowing
did not just there restrict it when they should.
Daily I pray that you do safely stay,
while all of the world moved and knowing
now far too late do not know what they could.
