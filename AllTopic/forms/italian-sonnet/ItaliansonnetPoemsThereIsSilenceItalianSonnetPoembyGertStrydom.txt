There silence in each hurting memory
as you walk on the footsteps of the past
but between us there is hope that last
in the things with which you trust me
where to my life you do bring tranquillity.
Even if life does us at times leave aghast
to this you stand in beautiful contrast
where for long moments I do you see.
Where new paths do together before us lie
God is guarding us against the infernal.
Your laughter is intimate and intense
and all cares do in such moments die
as if this summer will be eternal
while each thing and word you do sense.
