While the light of day does cease,
still outside many trees are blossoming
in the serene beauty of this early spring
but nature at this twilight has some peace
before the time of danger does increase
when nightly predators take to their wing
there is activity in the smallest nocturnal thing,
that hunts and feed and breeds with ease
as life comes to greatness in large and small
as every living thing is in a way special
in this time of new birth and change
and itâ€™s as if the blessings of God fall on all
and even in things superficial
the entire world His hand does rearrange.
