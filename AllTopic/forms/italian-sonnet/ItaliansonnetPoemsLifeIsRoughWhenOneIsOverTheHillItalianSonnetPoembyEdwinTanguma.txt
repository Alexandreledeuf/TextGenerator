Life Is Rough When One Is Over The Hill   (Italian Sonnet)
My love for you burns hotter than a flame
A flame which not even water may quench
If life were not so cruel youâ€™d be my wench
Yet it's cruelty of destiny to blame
When I say I love you I feel no shame
To those who threaten me I will not flinch
And if they torture me I will not wince
I will gain strength when I holler your name
Living without you in a world so cold
I am torn in two and my heart is still
My youth was fleeting and I have grown old
In my youth I had strength and I was bold
Life is rough when one is over the hill
Yet I am glad my soul has not been sold
