(after Dante Gabriel Rossetti)
Beauty like yours is very rare and do not fall
in Homer's, Keats's or Shelley's poems sublime,
as concept as Michael controls the mechanics of time
and from no other do I such looks and personality recall,
not even in the passing four season's footfall
and you do only live in these few words of rhyme,
like a ephemeral creature in a untouched clime
that throws at times just a shadow onto the wall,
as if pure magic does your existence bequeath,
where as if to nothing and no one you do belong,
with pure eyes and a divine smile look at me
where in a love-rite you do in this verse breath,
only by what is written here do grow strong,
where in you the essence of all women I do see.
