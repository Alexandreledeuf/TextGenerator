Go boil Easter eggs and color them well
Pray to your image hanging on the cross
After all humanity is as dross
Its graven images will lead to hell
All of their eyes are covered with a veil
The one and only Satan is their boss
And in the end their gains will be their loss
After all it was their souls they did sell
Solomon was the vainest man of all
Yet in his heart he believed he was just
I believe that is what led to his fall
When I was young I heard My Fatherâ€™s call
I ran as Jonas to the world of lust
To preach its destruction I lacked the gall
