(after Robert Herrick)
Ask me to live my life for you,
your own man in life to be:
I will love you with everything in me,
and I will love you sincere and true,
I will know you in everything that I do,
I will give you a heart full op hope free,
I will treat you with respect and dignity,
will you to the end of the world pursue.
You are my soul, my spirit and my heart
the essence of what a happy life truly is
where daily you do act in a way that is kind
to my existence and life each and every part
and in all of this you do bring me bliss
you are in my blood, my heart and mind.
