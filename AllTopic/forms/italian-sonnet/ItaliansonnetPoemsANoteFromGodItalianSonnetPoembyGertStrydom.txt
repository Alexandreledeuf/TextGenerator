I am a possible friend but you do not know me
at the sight of me you do turn away.
I am the one that do smile at you today
while you do seem extremely happy.
I am the type of leader that you do want to be
but time and again my orders you do not obey.
I am the One to whom you do not pray
where yet you do give to others in great charity.
I am the true council that will try and help you,
maybe the only person in your life that does really care,
the one that will not ever on you leave the blame
and my friendship, my selfless love is always true,
of everything in your life I am constantly aware
and today and yesterday and forever I am the same.
