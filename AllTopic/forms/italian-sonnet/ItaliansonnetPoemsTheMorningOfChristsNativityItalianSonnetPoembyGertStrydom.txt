It was the most blessed morn
and men did go on their normal way
as if it was but any other day
when in Bethlehem a male child was born.
A bright moving star did the sky adorn
and throughout the world children did play
while most men lived just as they may,
some men where good, others angry and stubborn
but in all of this the prince had come
to bring to earth peace, tranquility and love
to change the world and quench all sin,
to give to every single man a happy home,
to make an impact that no one can remove
and with his everlasting reign to begin.
