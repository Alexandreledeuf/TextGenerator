(after Robert Browning)
All other times things, people coming before
has no consequence when we merge intimately,
as when we are apart, act separately
between us the depth is just so much more
as we enter life's, ecstasy's central core
while we are one and you are around me
kisses are sublime, time lingers eternally
as if nothing can be anything more
when all of life is condensed as true
with soul and sense in a single moment,
when each to each together we do meet
in the connection between me and you
in bliss, rapture, in perfect enchantment
and life that moment is eternally sweet.
