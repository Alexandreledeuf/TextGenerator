Early today I walked deep into the unspoilt veldt
while grass and bushes and flowers still had dew,
where in this summer everything seems anew
and right there the loveliest wild lily I had smelt,
five cupped pink-white flowers the stem stoically held,
it was the first that on summer its fragrance threw,
where graceful among some thorny bushes it grew,
amazed that the night's hail did it not to bits pelt
that sweet wild flower did me of you remind,
in my heart and mind you did fit the picture well,
in sheer beauty so much of you it reminded me,
among the thistles and thorn-bushes it seemed kind,
as if no refined cultivated flower could it excel
and there growing very vividly wild I left it to be.
