The Doll's tears finally shatter.
People begin surrounding to watch the show,
All with a burning desire to know.
To her nothing else seems to matter.
The crowd goes on with their chatter.
Row by row,
They see she has lost her golden glow.
Everyone already began to scatter.
Alone she waits,
No longer needed.
Her skin begins to break,
As her escape awaits.
The porcelain girl who once pleaded,
Can now awake.
