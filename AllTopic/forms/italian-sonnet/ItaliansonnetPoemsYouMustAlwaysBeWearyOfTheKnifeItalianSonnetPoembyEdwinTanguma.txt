You Must Always Be Weary Of The Knife   (Italian Sonnet)
From the day of my birth I have been poor
Though all of my needs have always been met
Even through the times I was deep in debt
Thank God I never really needed more
My Father has shown me beautiful ore
Yet I believe I am already set
Sure it would be nice if I had a jet
As if I have found some lost mines of lore
I'm very content with my simple life
And I believe I have all that I need
Most of all I have a beautiful wife
Sure there are times my life is filled with strife
Yet when a person is cut we all bleed
You must always be weary of the knife
