(after Dorothy Parker)
You do not know
how much I care
about the little things that lays me bare
as love at times come and again go
and sometimes it is in happiness or sometimes woe
while my sincerity is always there,
love is a thing at which I still have to dare
and it’s not always constant even if I want it so
and sometimes I am again on my own
while love flies like a bird away
and even when I do not want it like this
my beloved’s heart at times turns to stone,
while at times it’s a great happy day
and this is the way that life and love is.
