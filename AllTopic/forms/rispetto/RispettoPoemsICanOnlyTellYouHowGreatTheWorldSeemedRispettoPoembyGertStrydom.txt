I can just tell you how great the world seemed
and what at the time you had meant to me,
suddenly destiny at a time deemed
fit to unleash unknown pain and tragedy
from which you could not be saved, redeemed;
nothing could avoid coming calamity
claiming you to the cold and uncaring ground,
turning my whole world upside down and around.
