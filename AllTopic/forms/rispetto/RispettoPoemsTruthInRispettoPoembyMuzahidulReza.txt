Truth is everywhere in the nature I see
In air, water, animals, plants, flowers and fruits
Seen, unseen, known, unknown element may be
Truth here as great teacher usually sits;
In beings' cells and things' atom and nuclear
Truth here and there; in and out is so clear
And always beyond dispute to a sharp brain,
My rispetto verse will bear this for lifelong.
