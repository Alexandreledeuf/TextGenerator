Obtaining Virtues (Rispetto Poetry)
............................................. ......
Any of the true virtues breeds minimum one
Or more than one of such virtues and features,
So counting on the virtues one after one
Should learn and acquire these all human creatures;
As they candidly claim to be rational
Liberally claim to be reasonable,
For this they should show the open evidence
They should avoid sincerely all violence.
