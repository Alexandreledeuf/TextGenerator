Just when you think that things are right
You get blinded and lose your sight
Just when your world starts to crumble
God gives you much to live thank for
Many surprises waiting at your door
Blessings He gives us be humble
Just when you think that things are right
You get blinded and lose your sight
So when you think nothing is right
Keep hope focus on His light
Just when your world starts to crumble
Blessings He gives us be humble
Just when you think that things are right
You get blinded and lose your sight.
