Tuscan folk verses were such emotional
Inspired and made the folks anyway quite active
To lead honest, happy life as usual
Helping one another is danger and need;
In the farm land the peasants sang while working
Gossiped ancient tales at leisure spending
Even at present recall the generations
Them through Rispetto and various occasions.
