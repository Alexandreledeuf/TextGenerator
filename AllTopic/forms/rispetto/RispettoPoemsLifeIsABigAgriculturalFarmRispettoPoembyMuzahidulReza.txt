Life Is A Big Agricultural Farm (Rispetto Poetry)
............................................. ................
My life is a big agricultural farm
Here I am a farmer to cultivate crops
Various cropses I need in life is term
I look for companions even some troops;
If none accompanies me I go alone
To the preknown and preseen right path along,
I see life is short but need to go so far
And in this short time need to earn more and more.
