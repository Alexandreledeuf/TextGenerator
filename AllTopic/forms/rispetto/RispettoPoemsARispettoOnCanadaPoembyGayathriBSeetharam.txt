Canada is a lovely work of art
It is a creation of mostly beauty
And its apt aspect is that it is vast
Its nature of brevity are witty summers
Its people come from different cultures
The only caricatures are men as mooses
And beavers with their dances as women
Canada has no dunces as its women.
