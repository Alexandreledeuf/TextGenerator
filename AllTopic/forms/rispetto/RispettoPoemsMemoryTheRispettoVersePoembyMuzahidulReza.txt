Memory (The Rispetto Verse)
............................................. .
Putting emotion written in rispetto
They have gone out of this well known horizon
The rest do remember them in weal and woe
Today their memories bear them every zone;
Forces are emerging out of those writings
With honesty, equity, more qualities
Inspire generations ever and ever
For worldly, spiritually everywhere.
