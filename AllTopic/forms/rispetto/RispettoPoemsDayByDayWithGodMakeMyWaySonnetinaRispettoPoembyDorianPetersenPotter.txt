Day by day with God make my way
And to him I can always pray
Doesn't matter wherever I go
Life can be very hard at times
But with him I'll cope and be fine
With his love my heart always glows
Day by day with God make my way
And to him I can always pray.
Here on earth till see promised land
My life rests in palm of his hand
Doesn't matter wherever I go
With his love my heart always glows
Day by day with God make my way
And to him I can always pray.
