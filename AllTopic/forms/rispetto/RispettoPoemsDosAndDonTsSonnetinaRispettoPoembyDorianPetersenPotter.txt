Don't learn all in life the hard way
Be positive, keep faith each day
And hope that you opt for what's right
Think twice thrice before wrongs you do
Only you decide what's to be
Let light illuminate life bright
Don't learn all in life the hard way
Be positive, keep faith each day.
Do what you think better, be wise
Be smart before problems arise
And hope that you opt for what's right
Let light illuminate life bright
Don't learn all in life the hard way
Be positive, keep faith each day.
