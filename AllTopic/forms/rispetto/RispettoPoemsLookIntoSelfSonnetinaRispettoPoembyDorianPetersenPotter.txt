You must return to the very start
Just look into your mind and heart
And so you can be born again
Heed my words for I do not lie
To be born again old must die
Free from all the pain and the sin
You must return to the very start
Just look into your mind and heart
For, if I may be really bold
The new is born out of the old
And so you can be born again
Free from all the pain and the sin
You must return to the very start
Just look into your mind and heart
