When she gave me a violet blossom, my pastoral love,
A rustic girl
From a mud-house,
I could not my think of the limits of my joy,
A blessing from St.Valentine indeed,
A shepherd girl
With the lambs coming to gift me a flower,
My joy knew no bounds.
Unassessed love, rare and priceless,
so simple, so innocent, pure and guileless.
