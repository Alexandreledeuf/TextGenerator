The Pastoral Song
February 24, 2020
Moo the big cows
Bawl the calves
And bellow the oxes
Bleat the big goats,
Baa the babies
Bleat the rams
Baa the babies
Neigh the horses,
Bleat the calves
Squeak the rabbits
Suack the ducks
Cluck the hens;
All day long ruffle these
At evening ends
Then the cattle take rest
In the dark shed.
