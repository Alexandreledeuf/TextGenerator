If you keep reading,
Reading
Even in your old age,
When, when
Will you smile with me,
Talk with me,
My love?
As say they really
If he keeps reading,
Reading all the time,
He may go mad,
Fully mad
As for being lost in studies
And researches.
If leave you,
Leave you not your studies,
I shall,
Shall leave you
For my parents' home
And shall never,
Never return.
My love,
What has it happened
To you
That smile you not,
Talk you not,
What has it to you?
Have you,
Have you not time
For talking with me,
Gossiping,
No time to see me,
See me?
Who will,
Who will bring
The ribbon, lipstick,
Nail polish, hair oil,
Red water colour,
Vermillion, bangles,
If remain you lost in books?
If leave you not your studies,
If leave you not,
I shall have the last option
Left with me
That to burn your papers
If leave you not our studies.
I shall fling
All of your books and papers,
Shall burn them down
By pushing into
The hearth,
The earthen oven
For the cooking purpose.
Having said it,
Marked it for sometime more,
The rustic love started weeping
None but herself,
Flinging the cups and dishes,
Rolling on the muddy floor
Of the country home.
A pastoral girl
Who used to love and live
With the goats, sheep and cows
Dwelling in the country,
Never could she take it
In a light way,
A village girl she,
A pastoral shepherd girl.
And what twitched it more
That somebody had communicated to her
That he would move overseas
If he went on reading as thus
Being lost in books and rapt in studies
Surely would to Vilayat
And so she before the happening of all this
Wanted to desist him from.
O, I see,
He would got to foreign,
Foreign
And would bring a rival,
An English,
A European memsahib
And would smile in her company
Which but how shall I tolerate it?
