Pastoral Day
{Free Verse}
Jul 25,2019• Copyright © daniel miltz
Busy, grasshoppers jumping
Through daffodils resting
Leaping quietly in grassy delight
As daylight smiles in bright
That bluster in sparkling glint
While burning dog days squint
Quietness, overcomes the day
Standing proud in accolade
Surrounded by leafy trees
As well as, sprouting, shrubbery
Creating a glorious, pastoral, greenery
In soft, bright, airy, summery
