All day long my cattle will graze
All day long I'll gaze
At nature
And will wait for her,
Pipe in left hand
Wild flower in right hand
Some clever animals will accompany me
I'll organize a band,
I'll sing the song
On her name,
All day long my cattle will graze
All day long I'll gaze
At nature
And will wait for her.
