The Pastoral Life
February 24, 2020
It is the pasture
Eat here herbivorous creature
The shepherds graze
Them the tender grass,
Day long go these
And at evening ends
Stomachful creatures take rest
In the dark shed,
The pastoral life
Field, shed and bee hive
From where come milk, honey
And huge of meat dainty,
Once I visited such a field
Where mooing I heard
Then slowly went near
The creatures looked so dear!
