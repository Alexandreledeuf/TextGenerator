Muhammad (pbh) ,
Sent as the last Messenger and the Prophet of Allah to mankind,
Peace loving for humanity, the world;
Son of Abdullah and Aminah,
Preacher of Islam to establish peace worldwide,
Invites mankind to have faith in One God, Allah;
And to believe His sent man, Muhammad (pbh) ,
People begin to accept Islam, the complete code of life;
Some people disbelieving him make chaos;
Transferred from Mecca to Medina,
Fights several times for Islam,
Wins Mecca,
Pardons everyone,
Dismisses all chaos,
Relatives, friends, respectively all unite,
Almost all come under the Flag of Islam,
Establishes an ideal Democratic Republic of Medina,
With multi races, creeds, castes, colors and religions;
All become happy in peace,
Islam gets completed by an announcement of Allah,
During the final Hajj in Prophet's life on 6 March,632;
Died at 63, on the 8th June 632, in Medina.
