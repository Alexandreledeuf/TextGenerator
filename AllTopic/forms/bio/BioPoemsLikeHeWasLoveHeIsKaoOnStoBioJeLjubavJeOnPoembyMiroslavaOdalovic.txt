Being after the breath as if after the light
A butterfly chased by its wing
From the edge of the end pushed away removed
Burnt down by candles a road to sorrow path
To the beggars and begs a gown sewed for the sky
He knew neither hands nor touches
Neither the words nor the colour of his crown
Died for the beauty in an earthly pain
In a grave and verse not to die again
Like he was love he is
A throne built for an endless possible
Like he was love he is
A throne built for an endless possible
Za dahom ko za svjetlom
Leptir krilom gonjen
S ivice kraja odgurnut sklonjen
Spržen u svijećama
Sumor stazi put
Prosjaku i vrećama
Sašiven nebu skut
Nije znao ruke ni dodire
Nije znao riječi ni boju krune
Za ljepotu ginuv zemljano ponire
Grobom i stihom da opet ne trune
Kao on što bio je
Ljubav je on
Beskraju mogućeg sazidan tron
Kao on što bio je
Ljubav je on
Beskraju mogućeg sazidan tron
