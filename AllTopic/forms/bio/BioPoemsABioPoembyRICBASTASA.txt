Inside our pockets
is the privacy of our own stones
outside our faces are the familiarities of
our traditions
when we party
we say the same words actually
we fear
other people's anger
we cannot afford to disappoint the
visitors of our
common faith
the usual mess will be there
part of the party you know
sometimes we let go
we let loose what is too tight in our necks
we spit what is bitter outside the windows of our
tongues
there is always time for restraint in a few glasses of
alcohol
there is a time to make our mouths shut up
tying our tongues like ropes on
the railings of the house
of civility
personally i do not like this party where we become
decent fools
choosing the words
afraid of the truth
always fearing that we should have broken some rules
of engagements
most of the time we deny what our hearts are looking for
cold hands hold another set of cold hands
empty heads bang with other empty heads
on hollow sounds of flattery
one time i left the room where the party is going on
it is 11: 10 in the evening and it has become too intolerable
i need to be alone inorder to be free
i imagine you and i love this atonement when you still do not mind
how i feel
i am complicating it so much restraint
because even if i am now outside everybody
i still retain
the decency of what is right and wrong which i always
carry around.
