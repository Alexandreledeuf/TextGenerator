Each cell has life.
Each organ has life.
Each body has life.
Unicellular,
Multicellular and
Multi organed as they are.
Life is a force that lives
In each cell and
In continuity.
Bio force is different
Fro other forces
In that it has a drive to grow
Unlike others
That grow when fed.
Aim of the bio force
Is to thrive and struggle to thrive.
It knows no sin, no God.
