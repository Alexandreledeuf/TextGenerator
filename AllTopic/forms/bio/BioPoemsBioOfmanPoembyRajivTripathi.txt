Unknown Biographies
_______________________________
A number of unknown biographies
I have read in my very prime
Some were whiten with lime
Others were shrouded in crime
All mingled in the same breez
Of death and flew in unknown sky.
_______________________________
Leaves of those biographies
Some are fading other lash
Still lingers in my mind with flash
Strike at my entity and clash
With my soul that fills tears in my eyes
And wet my sorrunding moist with gloom.
_______________________________
Some of them are melodious
I still listen them playing string of my heart
And I bow, of course, they were expert
With the skill with a bit of dirt
All were intelligent and conscious
But unknown to all like mystery.

A number of biographies are common
Loaded with household full of toil
With friends and relative like coil
Still fragrant to me they whril
And looks at me and summon-
They are waiting to cling me.
