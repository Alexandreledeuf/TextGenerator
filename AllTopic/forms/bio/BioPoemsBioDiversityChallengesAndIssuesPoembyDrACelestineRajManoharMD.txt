All life on earth is under threat
The threat is turning more real
More species are turning extinct
The environs needs protection
Pollution must abate somehow
Preserve the flora and fauna
Do not disturb their habitats
Bio-diversity is good
Life-forms must be sustained on earth
Put a brake on loss of this wealth
Ensure survival of species
Reduce poverty in the world
Many species are now extant
Crops shouldn’t replace precious forests
Global warming must be reduced
Humans should not encroach forests
The forests that our Nature grew
Can’t be re-grown by human crew
Forest fires destroy species
The people’s boom is nature’s doom
‘The beauty of the forests deep
Cannot be pried men who peep
When combine-harvesters do reap
All earthlings must lament and weep’
Forests flora cleanse up the air
Nature can endure and can cure
Nature can salvage and ravage
Man must not alienate nature
