Bio Psychic Kiss
Croons for catharsis.
Mull muse mitosis
Kibosh mute meiosis.
Niminy-piminy noesis
In oomphy orgy osmosis.
Syncretistic synthesis
Open splashy sluice
Bask blottoed bliss.
En fête relish éclat
Zippy zesty zygosis.
Join with Gen Next
In smooch symbiosis
Of Bio-Psychic Kiss!

[2] En fête [French] ~ In festive mood
[3] Éclat ~ Brilliant effect
[4] Zygosis ~ The state of being joined together [conjugation]
