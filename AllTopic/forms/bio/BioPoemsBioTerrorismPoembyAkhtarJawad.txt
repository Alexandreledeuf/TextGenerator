Why do you blame your Creator?
It's you and it's your ugly caricature,
You yourself go to a volcano's crater,
Ninety nine times you complete your adventure,
Safe and sound, you come back with a famous name,
But once you fall you get no time for regret and shame!
Why do you blame Satan, he is now old and tired,
He now bows his head before the bio terrorists,
A handsome pension he gets, he has been retired,
By capitalists, communists, and religious extremists,
Made of fire, sleeps in the volcano with no more desires
Made of clay, sleepless in the in the self-ignited fires!
