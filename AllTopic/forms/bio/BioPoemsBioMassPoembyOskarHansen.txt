I have had an intimate connection with effluence or
to use a more proper word, shit of the animal kind
I could by the aroma alone know which animal had
passed the track. Most animal dung smell is sweet
except dogs they have lived so long amongst us they
even crap likes us, but dogs love their own excrement
so much they even eat it. Horses` evacuations are like
rare wine and you promise yourself to buy a horse
when you can buy a bigger garden or vines that
have been fertilised by foalsâ€™ morning pee. Having had
your hands  in the muck nothing  can offend you.
