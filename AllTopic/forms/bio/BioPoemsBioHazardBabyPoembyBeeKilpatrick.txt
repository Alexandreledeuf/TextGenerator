You’re a biohazard baby
You became a blood sister
With the devil
When you were only three
You’re a biohazard baby
And I can’t believe that
Your evil heart has infected me
You’re a biohazard baby
You tainted my heart
With bloody misery
You’re a biohazard baby
With a PhD in breaking hearts
And you are handing out degrees
You’re a biohazard baby
They tested your blood
It came back type E-
For as evil as can be
You’re a biohazard baby
A transfusion can’t clear
The bad blood
Between you and me
You’re a biohazard baby
And you’re trying to
Suck the lovin'
Out of me
You’re a biohazard baby
Why don’t you
Bring your evil loving heart
Right here to me
Your a biohazard baby
