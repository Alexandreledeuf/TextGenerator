Has the situation really changed
or were we the only ones to transform
what is truly certain
whan our very lives are a loan
The more history of peoples and places I read
the more I feel for certain
that someone has already been here, done this
and forever closed the 'giving up' curtain
For in a world of reliable unpredictability
of constant repeditivity
of evidence, belief and hopelessness
- what are wem but attempted structure
in the socio- and biological mess
