Cynthia
Faithful, frank, patient, true
Mother, worker, a writer's daughter, child of God
Lover of cats, books, poetry, and wonderful nature
Who feels blessed, at peace, and thankful for life
Who fears nothing, not bad news, or even earthquakes
Who would like to see Israel, Beijing, and again, Queensland
Resident of Tarlac City, Philippines
