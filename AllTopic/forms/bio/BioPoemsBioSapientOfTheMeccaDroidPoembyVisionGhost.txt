Forlorn that of life likens the chronological and eventual embolism of time
Accordance to the modulated values for elementary suggestions of your prime
Yielded only from that of destination forming the impulse of emotional and logical legalism
Embalmed in fire concurrent to the pride for the instruments of warfare’s symbolism
Observatory of horrification resulting from the synthetic inventiveness for extermination
In faith of the most holiest for all tragedies beyond satirised methodology for religion
Spoken in values of hate from the seemingly amnesiac for the eventual mortality
That the origins of all birth cannot decline from the equality of biological infirmity
Irrevocable hath be that of the timelessness which is an inaccuracy; for all things end
In the fascination that all is well with the enemy upon their passing as wounds mend
That the never unified co-exist for the termination of paradise but embrace of pain
Being the germination for their seed of an unforgiving rage spoken via the distain
Lost are we in the recitation of repetition pondered yet are seldom accomplished
Are the comprehensions of historic failures captured, literalised but never abolished
For the playing down of truth unspoken yet the dramatisation of the cataclysmic news
But truth told we are literal in dying for release yet ignorant of the beyond so to amuse
We have become serial in our involuntary desire to contaminate yet replicate
In abundance of formation, the ever divisional reference to the elitist cognation
Shielded in the abundance of arrogance yonder that of the paradise of self denial
Lost of the unfathomed elasticity resulting in corrosion for total forgiveness to exile
Perhaps one can render the totality for the recovery to reformat and cleanse
Re-established the remains of world wise connectivity is worlds apart for the mends
In assumption of this lifetime of the now that a living entirety is not irreparable
Beyond the advances of the same; unexplored and never so far deemed censurable
Furthering of the technological prototypes for a greater and far less finite future
For my flesh I wish abound to machines that wire and metal do such for the nurture
Beyond a lifetime for tendering the anatomic in submission to the everlasting bio-mechanism
So to immolate imperfection for what remains of flesh beyond the cyber organism
To so thus construct of me; can a soul be encapsulated unto a realm of yonder machine?
As to place within the heart of an exact science created upon the image mankind’s esteem
Acknowledge I do my flesh, anoint I trust my heart, salvage of what remains of my mortality
Pass onto this place of retired bone and fragile being but to remember always, humanity
