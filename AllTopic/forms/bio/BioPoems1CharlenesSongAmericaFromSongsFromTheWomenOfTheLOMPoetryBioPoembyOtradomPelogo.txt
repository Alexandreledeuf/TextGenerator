Charlene's Song
Tethered  to Life by Virtue
To go back to the beginning  seems similar to piecing together
the phylogeny of our speciation
Then even more enlightened knowing that we met juxtaposed another  predestined quest, desegregation
But the collage begins to appear  as it did before from the vat of life's
Large gratuitous phylactery
And still as euphoric and soothing,  and like the craft of Faberge', still
somewhat of a romantic mystery
I was glad to hear that the other day, you were  pushed by a heart empathetic
And compassionate as well as zealous
And I realized I still had part of it, which ranged from botanical
To political to religious
When I think back to the days of swings  at Alice Keith, sitting by the waters at
Sabine Pass, it can seem facetious
But watching the stars in their serious but frolicsome nature, I realize it  wasn't really at all that capricious
Even now when I close my eyes, I can  hear the ballads you sang from 'Silent Night'   to the many whys of martyrdom
And realize that those whys are answered
With a most efficacious persistence
Which is why I call you an Otradom
I hear the guttural hymns of the winds  after having benevolently fostered  the sun back into the morning skies
Birds sing out the order of ascent,
Canines beckon their neighbors,
Kids sit abreast; one laughs, one cries
At the beginning of the season, you fashioned my heart, the greatest gift of the virtuous knight
And by the end of the summer, those  wounds had formed a crest, and created  a greater sight
The day I heard that the throes of life was a simple appendix, I rejoiced with  hallelujah
And after touring with Motley Crew,
Luther Vandrose and the Guys only  widened my panorama
There are really 'no good guys or bad guys'
as the song so eloquently says
I only wished I had written this years ago,  and wished you happier days
Like the prayer Otradom PeloGo,  the love you shared helped me through the days  my mind was in a martial disposition
And I now realize that its only  more venerated with judicial  interposition
It wasn't until the time we spent  in San Diego, that I realized
that my heart was not only wanton but  obstinate
And that when the other half was joined to it, it became complete as well as  immaculate
As we sailed the waters to Sapporo,  and danced with the children from igloo  to ice castle
The fact that I'm glad that half of my hearts is still in Misawa is regaling  as well as veritable
Its sometimes takes more than words to express the love between me and you
Therefore it's the last wish on the list,  one that means the constituents are
not only coupled with love, but also  tethered with virtue
Even after the semester ends, traveling  around the world seems to only extend  the trek, not allay
Then is embraced with affection while playing scrabble with Joe and Alta Mae
Then walking through an extravaganza  of memories books toys and clothes, so  fastidiously keen
While sorting out the favorite pictures of
Charles, Jay and Arlene
While sitting with Joshua, Solomon,  and Desiree, I realized life can  be so enigmatic as well as  eleemosynary
So I only advise applying  prudence as well as virtue when deciding
which hand delivered the one called Billy
The advise I've gotten from friends and family has only made me wise  as I brood and roam
And although there is only one place  we can call ours, there are a million we can call home
There are times I wonder how things will turn  out, how we're going to make it
Then there are times that I can easily
overcome when just  thinking about
walking through the Big Thicket
Even now I feel that because we can  overcome the past makes life as simple  as walking on black ice
And although it my never be perfect,
It's the effort, which I've seen, which  makes it a worthy price
As we ran like children from the Aqua
Festival, Lake Travis, and even to  the top of the Austin dam
Only to become more exhilarated as we  raced through the streets of Korea  as guests of  Uncle Sam
I still set things on fire, and promise to keep such an expensive point of view
And after the fourteen years of going  through it all, I still promise to keep  such an expensive I love you
After flying the ferrous wings of wisdom   from here to the heart of the Oakland  and San Francisco Bay
I've learned to love all things, respect all things,  and call all things except you and me
Go Pe (God's People)
Most of the time I would like to be  pragmatic, rational, but I desire
for you that part of  my heart remain  contumacious
And desire for us, that it remains open,   loyal, virtuous, and yet ostentatious
