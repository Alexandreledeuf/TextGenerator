COLD WAR WITH BIO-WEAPON
Poem by Chan Mongol
February 24 of 2020
It's now a worst cold war
Spreading virus and fear!
Who against who
Is China the foe?
What Americans Do
Same game others know too.
Is it real or rumor
Bio-weapons are there.
Crossing airports, borders
Failing metal detectors.
What's going on
Needing machines invention.
To detect germs, Virus
When smuggling in jars.
In governmental terrorism
Public is with corona syndrome!
Your tests on men are always on
With new medicines, new weapon.
Denouncing millions of years old success
For mad scientists and their madness.
The civic life is in turmoil
Why destroying air, water and soil?
You think you can fool us
With politics, cold war and corona virus.
Unnecessarily busy
Governments must take it easy.
You are within the range
In virus war, in revenge-avenge.
Bio-war will affect you too
So, don't do! Don't do!
Don't do any production
Corona virus or bio. Weapon!
