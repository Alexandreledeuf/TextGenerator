WIND BLOWS IN POSITIVE,
BLOWS IN NEGATIVE,
WATER FLOWS IN POSITIVE,
FLOWS IN NEGATIVE,
BOTH ARE PART OF OUR LIFE.
WIND IS SPECIAL FOR SOMEONE,
BIT OF JOLT,
BUT A SPARE OF LIFE TO THEM,
INDICATES DRIZZLE AND LULL.
WATER IN DRIZZLE FORM,
GIVE GLAMOUR TO NATURE,
BIT OF GULT,
GIVE A ELICIT TO NATURE,
BUT PINPOINTS CYCLE OF LIFE.
NEVER KNOW WHO COMES FIRST,
BUT ACCORDS CHANCES TO KNOW,
WE IGNORE, SPEND TIME SEMBLANCE,
OH! WE LIVE IN DARKNESS.
LIVING WITH NATURE IS LUXURY,
GIVES A PERMANENT ATTACHMENT,
BUT NEVER GIVES CRYNESS,
LINKS YOU WITH SOULNESS,
NEVER FORGET END,
NEVER FORGET NEGATIVENESS,
THIS ARE NATURE OF WIND AND SLEET.
