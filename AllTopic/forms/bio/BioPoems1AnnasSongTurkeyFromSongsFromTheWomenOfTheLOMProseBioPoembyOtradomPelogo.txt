Anna's Song
I have gotten to know a couple of women from Turkey and Russia, who I, when traveling through the UAE (The United Arabic Emirates in the Middle East, I guess you will soon notice that it is somewhat of a gateway for many) , stop by just to see if they are there and sit and have a shisha and a cup of Turkish coffee.  It's a really nice spot in the heart of what is referred to by the locals as the Deira district, right in the midst of it all, I guess it would be like the street over from Times Square, or maybe the main shopping strip in Brooklyn, where after sitting and having a cup of coffee, you can go straight out and feel the rush of the world outside of the door going about a hundred miles an hour.  There was a young lady whom I shall call Anna, like a lot of the others, I've incorporated her into one of the books that I'm writing, and even when we don't talk, she always has a story to tell, for she'll sit a few tables away from me and still capture my attention, going from happy to sad, to being passionately in love to even being dissatisfied; a platonic Scheherazade.  I can't be exactly sure what she told her friends of me; a dichotomous story of extremes after we met; but the next time her friends stopped by to talk and have a cup of coffee with me, seeing if they saw the person in me that she described or even the person that they thought they had seen in her.
