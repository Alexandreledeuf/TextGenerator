They were equally as beautiful and lovely, I remember asking one of them to marry me, you'll soon see that I will have asked just about each one of them to marry me, only to see them smile and discretely say no; every now and then, finding one bold enough to say 'sure', when they know that my mind is too far away to truly comprehend the acceptance at the moment, or they will ask ‘why', then have it merge into the next question.  And her friend, Nanya, asked the rhetorical; 'Do you want to get married', as she saw my mind drifting away from the same question that I had posed to her earlier, with me only vaguely hearing it and truly hearing it rhetorically, for a number of reasons; the main one, is that she had me over infatuated with her personality; and ironically enough, not only by her beauty, for Nanya is a very beautiful young lady, and not only by her youth, for she's young and contains the spiritual prowess of the spider; be it brown recluse or black widow, being pernicious, but yet soft, eloquent and delicate; making the mind defend before giving in to her.  For the affair with her friend had seem to be causing unforeseen problems, one that had me confused, but because I had felt that feeling so frequently that she was displaying,  I thought I was looking at a mirror image of myself, and though it reflected what I often feel; regrettably the dilemma of the dichotomous thin line of love and turmoil, brought on by being touched by someone; but the longevity of it staring back at me for what I might have done, broke the trance of that reflection and caused me to now ponder on my recent behavior, and though I could find none inordinate, it still perpetuated itself, where I was almost paralyzed from surprise that I could have transferred the monster that I elude on a daily basis to a young lady that I had now began to truly care about.
Nanya lives in Dubai's Deira district, where this is now taking place; a city in the UAE (United Arabic Emirates) , once ruled by His Highness Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum and now run by his heir, his son; His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who has  just over a few decades, turned Dubai into one of the world's leading economic ports where a financial and business district snakes along the city's waterway called the Creek, that many refer to as the Manhattan Skyline, which also brings in the bulk of the city's imports.  And the small lobby of the Ambassador is now becoming full; an eloquent and comfortable hotel, where you will see many people from many walks of life visit, from your average business guru, to a family vacationing in Dubai, where mom is dressed in the traditional black abbaya, along with the shayla covering her head; the gishwa; a thin black veil covering her face, rather than the burqa, which is made of a stiffer material, though I have, since I've been there, and I guess it's becoming part of a trendier fashion, if I'm correct, seen them now made out of a shaded synthetic plastic material.  Dad's head is covered with a gutra, which the men wear around their head, tied with an igal, the black woolen head-rope and wearing the kandoura, the ankle length traditional male white skirt.  The little ones will be mirror images of their parents, of course, just smaller, enjoying the fun of having gotten out for a while, and thus the lobby and dining area of this strategically placed hotel, which serves locals and tourist alike, has now become domicile; home, if only for a little while.
Anna sits there and stares; once my mind perceived her saying that I broke her heart; this is the woman that I asked to marry me, and who replied ‘no', and whom I have not seen afterwards until this very day.  And now, what the social psychologists would sometimes call an echo-niche; a group of men an women living in the same area/neighborhood, with many common bonds and interest, is now staring back at me as one;  and her friend, Nanya, now being the leader of this constituency with each second that goes by, and which becomes more foreign each time the smallest of the hands move clockwise, and with it, all routes and exits being closed here and abroad; for I was in the process of calling home on an hourly basis for assistance.
Like the true protector of the flock, she, Nanya, first honors those she is with, and with it, allowing darkness to rule that hour of my life before she comes over, sits on side of me and if only in a twinkle of an eye, being salvation on earth, the same one that was delivered two thousand years ago.  Or as Immanuel Kant would articulately state, that ('Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity.  Immaturity is the inability to use one's understanding without guidance from another.  This immaturity is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding, but in lack of resolve and courage to use it without guidance from another.  Have courage to use your own understanding! ' - that is the motto of enlightenment.)     On my spiritual quest that I have been on for only a little over a decade, on any man's or woman's quest, it is the ultimate presence of the quest; to go into a situation that is either on the verge or has turned tumultuous, and deliver a resolution, where it is either resolved or the worst is kept at bay until it can be resolved, and more virtuously enough, where everyone, simultaneously is at calm. And thus I go back into that prayer and add, The Year of The Peacemaker.  She sat there and as if surprised after asking did I want to talk to her friend, as I said, somewhat shocked when I said yes, which meant that everyone, until she asked, had thought that there was a mutual and pessimistic feeling floating around the room.  She then asked me could she come up to the room with me; I told her yes and we walked up together; I only tell further because she keeps being surprised at myself being the opposite of what she had thought; the vulgar monster that had fallen in love with her friend, and somewhere between he and her, the Heaven's providentially allowed it to be misinterpreted, so when all has given up on this situation, which is now spiraling into oblivion, Excalibur is pulled from the rock by the true heiress.
And of course from that exhilarating initial meeting, we continued being friends and have had nice quiet talks about life; I was showing her a video of my family, and was glad to have her give me the opportunity to think about them for an extended period of  time, and in amusing retrospection, remembered telling her how much I loved them; even having a chance to have such a long conversation these days are rare, and it takes time to get somewhat of a rhythm going for something so intimate; stating that, after seeing pictures of each one of them, that this was my mother, the love of my life, until I find a wife; ironically enough when the concierge knocked on the door, she told him we were going to get married, prudently reflecting on what I had said; I then went on to say, as we were scrolling through pictures and videos, that these are my two beautiful sisters; I called my oldest niece my girlfriend and my youngest niece, a lovely little girl, whose face has launched a thousand ships, the Helen of Troy, even saw her humorously react when a picture of a young lady who also lives in Dubai named Niva popped up on screen, and I said that this is Bad Girl Niva.  She then showed me a picture of her little boy back in Chechnya, about fourteen years old, a nice and studious looking young man, whom I would have loved to have met, and a picture of the countryside where she grew up, along with family and friends.  I had already, by the time that I had met Nanya, incorporated Anna into the other book that I am working on as one of my lead characters, and not to dare compare the two, for they are two unique people, from different worlds.  Yet after meeting Nanya, and thinking about her, and the time we spent together, I found in her most of the things that I was looking for; for she totally caught me off guard, things not found in a woman, for the qualities pervade gender, or man, but in someone special that I had been searching for, especially since starting what I have called my quest, for a long time.  So as not to forget, I ran back to the computer, searched through the files and opened up the unfinished work, took one of the lead characters that I truly enjoyed working on, and thus, changed her name to Nanya, where of course I will go and only add to its' character with the life of this special young lady called Nanya.
