A tale of a human God,
Whose tail with immortality coiled.
He'd left his cloak beyond,
And visited an hemisphere to lend one.
Rag of rags was he girded in:
Not by force, but his unwilling wish.
He'd made a league with the reserved,
And even battered himself for the undeserved.
He's yet who he is,
Though many call him a name that's not his.
He's Yahuah's salvation,
(For blessed is he who come
In the name of Yahuah; his form)
But 'Jesus' had many taken him to be in misconception.
He'd done his task, and removed the scar,
He's no one than 'YAHUSHUA'.
