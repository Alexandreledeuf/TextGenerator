From the lap like lotus
Chirping to see
The nest of the world
The infant squats and runs
Unknown to reality
He holds everything
As his own to made for him.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
An affinity in dawn and dusk
For years a few
Serves him for pleasure
In the world of heaven
And he explores
In his flights of feeling
False things as truth.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Prevention of pleasure
As the law of world
Comes to him
And opens his eyes
When he becomes a man
Who can raise his head
And hold things in his hand.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Complexity encompasses
His existence abroad
Like a gymnast in the ring
Twisting his another
He twists his own entity.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Unknown knowingly to his deeds
He remains engaged
Setting a goal after another
But false all
Thus the truth comes
And withdrawals him
From the complex ring.
