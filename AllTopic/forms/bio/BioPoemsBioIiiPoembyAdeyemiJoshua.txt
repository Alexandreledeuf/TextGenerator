Once a time upon itself,
The wave of conception had blown
And outweighed a fair self,
Who to pregnance was loaned.
Then she did bore a berry,
That's achetyped to the southern cherry.
(It's shape like the mortal,
And his wits like the immortal.)
What was brought forth by the self,
Was no other person but my veryself.
And then i'd grown and still growing.
The berry is now in poetry glowing.
And one day the berry would be ripe for the teeth,
And either death or rapture shall eat it.
