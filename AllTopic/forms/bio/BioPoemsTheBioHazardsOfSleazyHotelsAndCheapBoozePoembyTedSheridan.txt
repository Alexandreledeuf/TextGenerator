I have a flesh eating virus that is eating me
It loves red meat but won’t touch a fine steak
It feeds on me at night and wakes me with pain
As I strive to remember where I hid the morphine
It tells me it is my friend and will put an end to my plight
I can call it C for short it says
In a voice similar to that of my own
It tugs at my balls to see my chagrin
As I curse and rehearse my epitaph’s end
And take another x-ray for the Doc
Just to make sure a flesh eating virus is all that I’ve got…
