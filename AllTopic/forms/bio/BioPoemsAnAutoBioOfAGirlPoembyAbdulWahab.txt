I was brutally beaten up by a beast
Whom my mother brought in home
When I was thirteen
Instead of being grown in love and care
Since then I continued to bleed
As immediacy next year
I was raped by my neighbour
Instead of playing in the fields
I was bleeding between my legs
Now at the age of twenty four
I bleed from my eyes
As they show my rape- movie every day at night
I can not remain awake
The haunting scenes flashed back as memories
Nor I go for sleep as  my  dream plays back
What I have stored in my memories
Already twice I took knife
To cut short this horrible life
But each time I failed to say good byes
As appears the face of my child in my eyes.
