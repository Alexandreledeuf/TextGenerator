A Bio Chemistry of Digital Heart
I locked my heart
And forgot the password
How you got it to enter?
Atria and ventricle chambers
Interchange the coronary blood
Our hearts too have interchanged.
Handful only is our heart,
Depth and breadth
Are manifolds of the Ocean.
You told me to occupy a tiny point
But, you're flying all around my heart;
Like a butterfly leaving any single spot.
Thermal power, nuclear power
Hydroelectric power, which everyone knows
Heart electricity, feel it only now.
Intimacy compliments mutually in love
Gifted are the hearts in wet
Dried hearts will only rest.
My heart weighed so high
Flying easy now
Just because of you.
