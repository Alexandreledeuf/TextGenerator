A juerga with flamenco guitars,
With fires blooming like red flowers,
Corpses dancing in moonlight
The dance of wounded souls,
Vibrant  red dresses
White shirts like birds,
Falling  shawls,
Dancers,
Sky,
Claps,
Cubic
Movements of
Color, music's
Seeds, hands being wings
Shadows on the white wall,
From soul detaching  passion's
Lights, motion vibrating the string,
Resonance for a new dimension.
