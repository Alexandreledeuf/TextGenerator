Half rotten, the other side of the mango
had the lust in subconscious mind
part eaten by insects and birds
soon the smell will spread
making it unbearable
and passion to have
will be gone
pick your
mango
from the tree
a green mango
will be long standing
relationship though unripe
will last in their life's tree
craving for the sweetness in their love
savoring the fleshy sweetness of the mango
