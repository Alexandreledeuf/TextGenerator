In the time of crises and danger
You help human, do for human
And you do feel for human,
Call human for human
Say ‘man is for man'
Says it the mind,
You're great,
Perfect
Man.
You
Do this
Not to show,
But to serve man,
Surely a great done,
You are successful one
Good people will follow you,
God'll favour you in your need
As you have done for humanity.
