I pick a rose for my valentine.
A flower is my valentine.
I pick candy for my valentine.
A sweet-sweet is my valentine.
I pick gems for my valentine.
A ruby is my valentine.
I pick a ring for my valentine,
rubies and gold for my valentine.
These I choose for my valentine
Yet a list ten times is not enough
The rose and candy are not enough
The ruby and gold are not enough
For my valentine, they’re not enough.
She gives me her heart, my valentine
Her womb and her lips, my valentine.
The picked rose withers and candy rots
Gold fades and rubies break,
But life is given by my valentine
The gifts I give are not enough,
And my heart she already has…
