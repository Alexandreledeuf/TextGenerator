Not by what we say but by what we do
Not by being silent can we prove what's true.
Not by passive stance can we make things right
Not by shades of gray is there black and white.
Not by being fearful can we keep our land,
Not by false illusions can our freedom stand.
Not by being cowards are the battles won,
Not by being still can many things be done.
It takes real men to stand and face the foe,
It takes truth in us to walk where we must go.
It takes every fiber here to negate the lies
It takes boldness to stop our own country's demise,
It takes unity of heart and one goal to find
It takes all the governed to speak out their mind
It takes just one man to bring utter destruction
It takes blindness to bring death to a nation.
