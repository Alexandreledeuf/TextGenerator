Desire
Lips sealed with a kiss
Lips parted for more
Don't you know my love
Desire for ever more
The saga of ancient lore
Maya (Illusion)    In Nature
I am the Eve of your Garden
Defamed by fate's cruel hand
I bore you in me as a thought beautiful
Carry the energy per your command
I am but the executrix of your deeds.
