•	Special
silly,
he makes me laugh
out loud and enjoy life
as we travel down this new road,
hopeful.
•	My wish
loving
what i'm made for
if i can trust enough,
fight through the past to love anew,
be loved
Wistful
Longing
to have my life,
to live to the fullest,
without the doubts and fears I have
to scale
•	Golden
Blue skies,
Crisp, autumn air,
Crunching leaves under foot
Evokes memories of times past
and gone.
•	Hopeful
Sharing.
So new to me;
Trusting someone enough
To tell my secrets and my fears,
Grateful.
•	Hunger
Thin crust.
Pepperoni,
Onions and mushrooms to
Balance out the blend of flavors.
Yummy.
•	Halloween
ghos tly,
shimmering light
dancing around the stones,
as they rise for their one night free,
haunting.
•	Torture
Ringing,
The phone won't stop;
It drills its sound into my head
and lends itself to impure thoughts-
Five yet?
•	Anticipation
waiting,
it seems like time
is dragging on and on
as I wait for a special day-
patience....
•	weary,
I watch the clock,
count down the last half hour;
I long for solitude and peace,
relax.
•	kissing
is wonderful,
an intimacy I
sorely missed in my married life,
craving.
•	sickness,
dizziness sucks!
all I can do is lie
on my bed and attempt to sleep,
bitter.: -(
•	Palin-
Men think she's hot;
Women want to slap her;
It scares me to think of her in
charge-NO! !
•	Driving;
Moving away
From one I hold so dear,
Not knowing when I will be back,
Miss him.
•	confused,
he says odd things
that make me wonder if
he feels the way he says he does,
or not.
•	counting
the days until
I see my sweet again,
and all our fears can be laid to
rest; sigh
