OH.!
you tiny
drop of dew
dampen its thirsty flowers
gently.
A
lovely face
in my memory
as delicate as a
doll.
Hair
so soft
to the touch
more smooth than finest
silk.
Eyes
so green
deep jade like
finest emeralds they would
fade.
When
you came
my blood danced
rivers of hot desires
flowed.
You
became my
body, face, death,
my carnival of loving
words.
Be
a rain
falling gently in
the night of my
sleep.
You
will hear
my heart beats
calling out your lovely
name.
Leave
your hair
rest on my
chest, while you fall
asleep.
You
are my
home of love
the sparrow of my
dreams.
So
inhabit me
full of eagerness
I am the knight
seeking.
