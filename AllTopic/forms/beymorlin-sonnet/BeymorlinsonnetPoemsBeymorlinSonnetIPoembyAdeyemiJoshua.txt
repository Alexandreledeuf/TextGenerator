He'd intend to cook beans accompanied by rice,
Then relayed his thought first.
He pretend he wouldn't wash the rice,
And dismayed when the pair did rest.
Then prepared he the beans before the grain,
Washed clearly to purge the dirts.
He adhered to the boiling water as urged by his vein,
And hastely put the beans next.
The rice was soften as the foam,
To put the beans now, the rice is marred.
The ice of heat could not the bean's starch withhold,
The mute force could not press it flat.
He's ought to make rice before the beans,
But sort inverse, had wrought another meal.
