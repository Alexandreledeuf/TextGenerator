The sons of prophet could by heart discern:
Their horns were lifted to by nature learn.
'Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait
For us.' They'd spoken too late.
But the prophet could with their eyes see,
And lead their heart, 'Go ye', his elated glottis.
But before they left for their own course,
They implored the prophet to be their horse.
'I Will go', again he did say,
His will accompanied by their way.
And after they'd gone to pluck off logs,
Their desire made off the axe head into the water fog.
So did they called on the man of YHWH, who they'd invited:
His bid by them had them liberated.
