The lorry waved at me,
In hurry the land see
To the affair of the dust,
And He: the latter did rust
By fear and lent his courage to fright,
Till there arose the willful night.
Then he cleaned his faced with his rag,
And seal his courage with a nag.
I, gazing at these folk was mouth agape,
Lost, grazing on the pasture of the grape
Of indecision that'd been served
In decision by the untutor'd unified lads.
Thus did I stayed till twas dusk,
And did for that had my heart misled.
