God's love had made all things in universe;
The Potter shaped first Adam from mere clay;
Above all beasts, He placed him, not inverse;
Begotten was God's Son on Christmas Day!
Man's sinfulness had gone beyond limits;
God planned to save the human race by cross;
Christ's win by resurrection sure befits;
The clan of satan cannot bear the loss!
The world of demons will not give up fast;
Their doom in hell awaits their end of time;
The hurled down devils want humans too cast;
The womb of purity turns less sublime!
Christ's blood-shed saved the human race from hell;
The wood that bore the Lord has truths to tell!
Dedicated to all Poets who are Modern Sonneteers
