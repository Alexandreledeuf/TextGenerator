My flowery dream was a cottage by a riverside
and I struggled through my whole life to fulfill.
When I open the little windows
I could see the shepherd, cattle and sheep.
Oh! the greenery pasture.
My gregarious pregnant housewife,
she is in a hurry like a bee in the morning
and peeps out to collect manure for her flower pot.
She delivers her fifth child
I hope somewhere in the March equinox.
What else I want?
If life goes as a Nursery rhyme.
