Sun about to die
The car broken down
And a smell of spring
Remains as the air sweeps by
Somewhere
a song
WHERE ARE YOU
One afternoon much like this
I looked for you in vain
In the fog covering the roads
I kept finding myself
And in the smoke of my cigar
A lost bird
Nobody answered
The last pastors drowned
And the stray sheep
Ate flowers and did not give honey
The wind that went by
Piles up their wool
Between the clouds
Holding my tears
Why cry once more
about what I've cried already
And since the sheep eat flowers
Sign that you went by
