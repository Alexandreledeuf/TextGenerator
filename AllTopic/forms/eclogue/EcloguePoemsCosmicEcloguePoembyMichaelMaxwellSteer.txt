The night wind is the breath of God,
zephyrs from the inner world outside …
bearing certainty, silence, reconnection -
a still room within the house on busy street.
In that silence messages come:
sometimes banal, sometimes moving,
sometimes challenging as dreams,
sometimes of radiant affirmation:
always quietly nudging us toward
integration: showing -forcefully
or otherwise- our paradoxes:
beckoning each to a new congruence.
You are the one standing alone,
in the darkened cathedral on the steps
hollowed by centuries of pilgrims,
trying to catch the echoes of faith.
You are the one by the ancient yew
where the keeil stood, savouring
the clear spring that drew the hermit here
in search of individuation.
You are the one standing alone
on the fire escape while the party
thunders, wondering how your heart
will ever make sense of its place in this world.
Tramping over the moors you've learnt
to trust the desolate path across the
watershead to the rocky descent
where the boisterous stream sings of its place
in framework of existence,
and you do not ask who twisted the thorny
bridge across it, because you know
that each one lays whatever gift
s/he can upon the infinite accretions
by which we become conscious
of the roots of time, overlaying our
contribution on countless others'.
Until at last, reaching the valley
of night, we come upon the quietness
of the inn with ox and ass
perennially present, and the mother
pregnant with eternity
knowing that in her child alone
lies the world's rebirth: its very
conception heralded by angels.
And wherever a baby's first breath
cries hir life-ache skyward into
the echoing night - therever,
as night dew, the unutterable breeze
returns the language of the spheres
(which children know, but baffles adults)
in whispered words that are ever simple,
ever the same: Allow … Trust …
