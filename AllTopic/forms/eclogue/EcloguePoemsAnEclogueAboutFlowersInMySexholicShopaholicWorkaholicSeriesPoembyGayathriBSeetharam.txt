An eclogue about flowers in my Sexaholic Shopaholic Workaholic series
-Gayathri B. Seetharam
The only condition that Wikipedia laid out in writing this style of poem is to make it have a pastoral feel or touch.
Rustic country sides call for romantic scenes "under the greenwood tree"
Or as the Sexaholic, I would love to have been the heroine in Manet's Luncheon on the Grass
With my husband and a male friend but this is an impossible equation
And hence, I, along with my three degrees in Chemical/Biochemical/Biomedical Engineering
Made a beautiful handcrafted flower pot adorned triumphantly with a laurel
And a pine cone and 2 roses crafted from wood which has a hardy and ethereal feel
Symbolising my journey through my schooling
And this has the fresh imaginary scent of the bucolic countryside;
But I am a city girl and therein lies the thoroughbred aspect, I feel in my case,
And amidst the songs in the wood
There has to be the song bird humming its tune
In the neighbourhood's High Park
And I shall, as a Shopaholic, enjoy the goodness of the pastoral landscape
With a walk to the same park and add to it a trip to the florist's
To buy rhodendrons and a rose to symbolise the heroine of the scandalous painting
And two lupins to signify her male companions and set the flower arrangement
In a crystal vase and I must say that a regular vase is a phallic symbol;
As a Workaholic, I have made a Flowery Walkway painting which with its beautiful features
Leads to the M.Eng and M.A.Sc achieving days of mine at Chem. Eng., U of Toronto
And flanks the 18 month research project that I did after a 22 month home stay with my baby boy
And later after an unpaid 6 months of working on two technical papers
It depicts the three month corporate work period in Iogen Corporation, Ottawa, in my life,
And if as Einstein has said, on looking at roses, you can't blame gravity for falling in love
I say that on looking at a pastoral landscape like the said painting, one can say that the weight of one's shoulders
Will be reduced if one is energised and if one sees the light.
