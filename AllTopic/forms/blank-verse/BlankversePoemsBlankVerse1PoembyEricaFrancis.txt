Your eyes are the colour of water
but it is completely frozen over
and there is no way into your vision
unless I somehow warm you up first
Alas, that is something I can't do
unless you're willing to let yourself go
and press your body against my body
in hopes that the sparks will make a fire
So until our bones lie in the ground
I will have a fire inside of me
and it is burning like Andromeda
just because you aren't here for me
but I wonder, if you come around
will I want to burn for you much more?
