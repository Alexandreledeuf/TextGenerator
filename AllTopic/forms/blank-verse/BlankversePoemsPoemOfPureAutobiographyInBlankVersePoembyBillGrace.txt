In youth I rarely prayed
So full of self was I
A lid of pride so tight
Only God could pry it off.
This thing called pride
Is no small thing
My street kids had it
And so did I.
The tension between us was great.
Love held us in its unseen sovereignty,
Ruled with a scepter no one saw.
At age added, a different scene -
Body and mind no longer impervious to time
This other thing I sense but can not name
A presence always there
The thing that gives the modern mind its scare
It does not work like gravity
But I know it's true,
Especially if I'm not too forceful
In declaring this truth to you.
