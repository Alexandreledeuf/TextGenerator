Your Sweet Names In Blank Verse
February 1, 2020
Your sweet names are for sweet qualities
When any of Your those names is called with
Belief in You and in the other terms
Concerned of You and Your warns and orders
You respond instantly to the caller
And solve the problems with blessings in time,
For example, I have committed sins
One of Your names is "Gaffer" / "Pardoner"
So I am calling by the name "Gaffer"
And in future I won't commit any,
You forgive me completely and kindly
And declare me a fully innocent.
