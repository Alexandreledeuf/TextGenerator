The Blank Verse For Cat And Dog
11 November, 2018
Two domestic animals when come in a
Comparison: dog and cat they are known
I set my some of right opinions,
The cat is silent and some fearful one
And the dog is loud barking and brave one,
Cat especially does something inside
And dog outside of home does much service,
Again cat needs less food but cozy life
But dog needs much food and any life does.
