I have always written my Poems
In Verses that do Rhyme and Scan,
Now I have discovered I can write,
Blank Verse with no Rhyme ~ but with Scan.
Words they stream into my Mind,
As line-by-line and word-by-word,
Onto this pad they get written,
At four twenty in the morn ~ fast and slow.
Besides the pain in my left leg,
Was it also hunger that awoke me,
Two glasses of milk I have taken
And now I am ready for my bed.
But, will I sleep ~ LORD will YOU let me?
I shall always acknowledge YOU,
Please let me rest my body,
And delay the words YOU are sending me anew.
Another cup of milk and I rest my pen,
Back to bed to rest my soul,
Give it back to me when I awaken,
Hopefully in the morn after ten.
