Blank Verse For Corona Virus
February 18, 2020
Corona virus is microscope germs
Why has it been so dreadful and vicious?
For humans' wrong doings and malpractice,
Oppressing others and abusing things,
Polluting environment, finishing
Its beings to disturb eco-system;
But to understand these they are so fool
So, they are going to lose too many!
