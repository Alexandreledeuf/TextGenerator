I'm not a Banker,
But I wish to be one:
Then in succession of my wish,
Sculped in passion to become thus.
Whenever I wake in the morn,
When the dawn thrust his lip to be Kissed by the anxious hay.
I'd taken up the regalia of a banker
And gird myself in it as if i'm one:
My Loosed tie and sweet suit,
Star shoe and wrist watch,
Heightened heart and sermonized soul,
Perfumed purse and oiled eyes.
And then would make for the path,
That lead to where my heart is.
For mid-decade did i continued in this,
Till one day I became one.
You wouldn't be what you Want,
In a day, or bewitched seconds span.
Whatever you wish to be, work towards it.
You will be one, the one, and one of the one.
Josh says so!
