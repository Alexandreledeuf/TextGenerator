The Grace In Billah (Blank Verse)
25 November, 2018
While writing anything or work starting
My mind, start by His Name and receive grace;
Coz, He is Allah, the most Graceful and
Starting any work by His name known Billah;
With Billah graces walk to starters, then
The piece of work will be finished fully.
