Arise!  Break fast m’lord dawn is nigh,
The dell awakens to the cockerel’s crow anon.
Durst thou hide, beneath thy tapestry,
Whilst I crumble to dust in my burial chamber?
Love of my life I beseech you come,
Be fain to meet me ere the church bell chimes at daybreak,
Forsooth there’s none to blame evermore.
