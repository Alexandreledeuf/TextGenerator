Their paper-like souls burn in nuclear flames;
Ablaze without remorse or contrition
Within them like Hiroshima or Na-
Gasaki on atomic pyres; burning
Unquenched and unabated until even
The damned and unsuspecting around them
Are themselves without mercy engulfed by
Its supernatural force, its white-hot
And enraged fury as if to disgrace a Hell
And Heaven in conspiracy together;
As gamma-rays consume their calcified
Bones, they cannot stand to behold before
Them Armageddon's Jesus that by Truth's
Light cooks their moist and fleshy tongues like a
Seared, Angus steak; as the sight of Him li-
Quefies their eyeballs into putrid ooze
In their twin sockets; as their head's ablaze
With radioactive decay and heat;
As ashen clothes like death's used-up robes fall
From their rude, roasting flesh, â€”and even the
Thews, sinews, ligaments and tendons of
Their limbs melt at the wrath of Christ's Next Ad-
Vent, ...until at last they are gently killed
Without hope of forgiveness or the grace
Of personal redemption, and are cast
Into the lake of everlasting fire
Where there is "weeping and gnashing of teeth."
