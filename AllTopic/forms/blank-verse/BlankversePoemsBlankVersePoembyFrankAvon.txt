The poems I compose in my head
are refusing to be plastered on paper,
or relegated to cyberspace;
they stop mid-verse and stare.
'I refuse to be committed, '
the poem says instead,
'to words.  Word-wise
I'm all in your head.'  That's all.
She is not whole.
She has no soul.
'My word, ' she said,
'I'm all in your head.'
In my head,
this is what I said,
and kept adding lines
all in a slow decline:
I am attached
to artifacts....
Today at Friends of the Library,
four books I bought....
Sixty-five of my years
I lived in 'the American century'....
You can't seduce poetry
from out of sheer prose.
Her eyes just roll.
'Ya gotta have soul.'
