Three ways orally, spoken and written
They practise some examples and maxims,
Repeatedly shown those while talking
But hardly are seen in proper ruling,
Administering to secure the rights
Of fully or partly oppressed, deprived;
I am not saying about others but
Our absurd democracy and leaders.
