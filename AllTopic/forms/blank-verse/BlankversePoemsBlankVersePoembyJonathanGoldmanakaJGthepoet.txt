How do you write with Rhymes and Scans?
What is Blank Verse? ~ I hear you say,
Poetry that does not rhyme in the verse,
Is called 'Blank Verse' today.
Poems in 'Blank Verse' must scan,
Each line in Meter must be read,
To tell a Story by the Poets too,
And sound right to them in their head.
It is not difficult to write in rhyme,
Think aloud the words you write,
As you put them down on paper now,
Or whenever ~ Day or Night.
In time you will learn to think in verse,
Your thoughts into rhyme will go,
Be prepared to stop and write them down,
When the words come ~ fast or slow.
Poetry is a Gift from HIM above,
Bestowed on so few of us,
To leave to this World and others to come,
The thoughts that pervade our head.
