The wings of desire
Mock the azure day-sky
Choosing forged feathers, wrought in celestrial fire
To kiss stars when given it's kiss to fly
Shining down a height which knows no higher
Overwhelming spirits, which within hearts lie
and when, if ever, this light comes to tire
The wistfulness of heaven's caresses soon die
Until falls dusk to the nights highest buyer
Where hearts burn deep and high
and the burning overwhelms, consumes desire
Fearing it's death, inbetween, it's own sweet sighs
