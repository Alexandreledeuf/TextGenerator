Yours own hands once loved me
Cared of me
Fed me
Took me walking to ever green path
In life I found a great rath;
Why are those now keeping me far?
Torturing me more
Throwing me to your hands made fire,
I don't know where to go
Leaving my homeland printed my toe;
I am afraid of those hands will kill me
Will cut me
Will tear me
In your hands made artificial hell
Beside your so called prayer hall.
