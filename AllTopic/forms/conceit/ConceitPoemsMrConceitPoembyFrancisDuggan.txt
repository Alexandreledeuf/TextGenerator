He looks so proud with his younger woman walking hand in hand on the street
The macho bloke with the big ego the one known as Mr Conceit
In his mid to his latter fifties his muscles through his tightly fitting shirt bulging out
Broad shouldered he talks rather loudly like a rooster he does strut about.
His woman in her late twenties with brown hair and attractive and to him quite attracted 'twould seem
To be seen out with one young enough to be his daughter is good for his sense of self esteem
And in self esteem he's not lacking about him there is nothing shy
Why older blokes with big egos get younger women about that I do wonder why?
A solidly built greying fellow though not attractive to behold
His grand-daughter in kindergarden she has recently turned five years old
He left his ageing wife to be with the younger woman in her prime a blond local Rose
But as they age women lose their beauty such is life one would have to suppose.
When he's out with his younger woman they stroll on the street hand in hand
That she's an extension of his big ego is not that hard to understand
For egotistical males would not know how to be humble and none more egotistical than he
For he is one by his body language who says you should be looking at me.
