The Conceit//
Razia Pellâ€‹
It's only October.
The evening breeze is breathing the chill of winter.
Maple leaves are turning brown.
The flickering of lights from the distant poles are bored like beggars.
The rose-petals are mourning their deaths in the dust.
The earth knows its orbit- the sun seems to be lost...
I have turned my eyes.....the blinds.......
let the stars dance, rejoice and  witness dark blue nights.....
