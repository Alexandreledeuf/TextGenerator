sometimes
you just have to accept that you don't belong
to anyone
or anybody or any group
or society
at first it is
painful to accept
trying to spell out this misery
but then
there is always that
on the other hand
that blessing in disguise
there is peace
in your being you
there is originality
in your journey
now that you are alone
but not really
lonely
lovely
is the scene without any
taint of any one
of them
their shadows
stink and you begin to close
your mouth
