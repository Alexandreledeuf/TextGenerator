Being human,
we first explained the world
to ourselves via human nature,
based on the observations we'd made
of our own and others' behavior.
The Earth and the Sky,
as entities, mated
thus initiating all of creation.
Completing the personification,
they were given appellations
such as Geb and Nut in Egypt.
In Greece, Gaia and Uranus.
Eventually institutionalized religions,
appropriated pithy, pagan observations
and warped them to suit the tenets
of Over Lords claiming to be agents
of the T.H.E. LORD
in order to continue raping,
not only the people, but the Earth,
to further entrench
their testosterone-driven domination.
Today we self-servingly apply our own motives
to everything we see and hear around us,
the essence of repression and projection.
Sigmund Freud would have been so proud.
This indulgent,
narcissistic fixation
- navel gazing -
is interrupted only
in the face of evidence
of our wish to deny Nature's imprint,
and sever the apron strings/umbilicus
by trying to rise above her,
and since we are OF her,
above ourselves,
which is as impossible
as the epithet anatomical
'Why don't you go f*** yourself'
(But we have done so, have we not?)
pagan - from Latin, 'paganus', a peasant, or countryman
from Latin, 'pagus', district, country
