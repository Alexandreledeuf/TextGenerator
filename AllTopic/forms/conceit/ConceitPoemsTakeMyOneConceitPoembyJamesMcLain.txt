Take My One Conceit
out of my mouth,
so I may kiss your lips.
And place my tongue upon
your palate, better to form
my words,
Ushered, 'Your each world;
before I speak them of
you, if and when it is poetry.
Take my thoughts
pressed hot to your ear,
so I can know, your the
voice of my one self,
and make me, into you.
While my mind, when you
return it,
was made true,
for the better of being used.
