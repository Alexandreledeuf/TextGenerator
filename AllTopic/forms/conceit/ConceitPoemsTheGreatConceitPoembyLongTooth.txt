If you are someone who WON'T compromise values,
Then tell me my friend how this makes you a saint?
For Bible, the Holy Book, you claim to worship,
Proclaims to the faithful that we all have taint!
Humility, brother love, mark of a Christian,
If you're sure you're in the right how is that you?
And different ideas suggest something's fuzzy,
If you won't discuss them, you're no brother too.
Hypocrisy always the mark of the fallen
And judgement temptation of devil himself,
Though sad, disagreement with brother, not world's end
And compromise good way to move off the shelf.
Could Tea Party leaders be truly satanic?
Self-justification can send you to Hell,
Our take on the Bible can never be Gospel
And questioning God sign you're faithful as well!
The Bible says faith is the stairway to heaven
But claims you've no doubts suggest your faith is dead!
God's Grace is not earned but the gift of Christ Jesus
Your pride in His gift must not go to your head.
