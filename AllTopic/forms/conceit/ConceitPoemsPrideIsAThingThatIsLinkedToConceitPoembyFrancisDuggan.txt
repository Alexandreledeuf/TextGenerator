It is something i learned as a boy in Millstreet
That pride is a thing that is linked to conceit
Most people in public do like to talk loud
Of the things in life that does make them feel proud
Pride of your country and your national flag
To many these are quite a common brag
Proud of your children and proud of your wife
And proud of your many successes in life
So many others do love to impress
With what to them is their idea of success
Others our praises we love to hear sing
This crave for recognition is a human thing
It is something i learned as a boy in Millstreet
That pride is a thing that is linked to conceit.
