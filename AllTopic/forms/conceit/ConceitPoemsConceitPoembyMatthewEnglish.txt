I’m liberal to a degree
in a world that cannot be free
of criticism over every step- not even
applause for success, just more to blame
as a consequence.
Slaving away is humanity, the meaning of life
is to work into comatose;
school a playground for the vindictive,
eighteen years wasted- twisted in cruel politics
that act as a veil over the popular press-
‘todays headline; lies.’
‘Affluence’? no, just another brick in the mortar
of a conservative consensus- no such this as labour or liberal views;
just money, twisting the brainwashed
populous- everyone, scholars who no longer exist, wiped
for crimes of thought. The right to speak- wiped.
Why must we slave away?
Money;
the most wicked sanction/invention- equite consolidation.
With the presence of money is the absence of freedom-
‘Pursuit of happiness/The American Dream’
what a joke.
