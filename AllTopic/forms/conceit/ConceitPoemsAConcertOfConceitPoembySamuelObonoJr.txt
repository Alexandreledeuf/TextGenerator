the grandstand
graced with greed
a design of deprivation
a backdropp of betrayal
choreographies of corruption
music of manipulation
and dance of deception
hear the drummings of devilish dreams
and echoes of exploitation
the symphonies of no sympathy
a spectacle of spite
an aura of autocracy
the audience
severely starved, stay stupefied
in the wonderments of woe
tenderly tortured by the thrill
but blissfully blind
innumerable interludes of bad intentions
magical moments of misery
a complete concert of conceit
shall soon reach its curtain call
