at the height of your conceit
you even think
that the sun shines only
for you
this morning
well, i cannot blame you
you are the better
poet
in your little corner
and yes, the earth is still the
center of this universe
and all the planets. the moons and that stars
all revolve around
you
mister poet.
i know i miss the sun, and the infinite  voiceless  void
they too bow before your highness
dear poet.
