listening to all of you
i finally choose not to talk
i travel inward in my blood
running inside my vessels
inside my heart i feel that
i am much better and then
i sit inside my brain still
thinking about so many things
those that i have not ever met
those that i have never for once thought of.
my hands are folded, my feet lotus
i float in the water above the mud.
