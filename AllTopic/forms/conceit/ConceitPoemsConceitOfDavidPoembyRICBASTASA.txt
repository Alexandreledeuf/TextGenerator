as i watch myself
naked before the mirror
taking comfort in
every muscle and
bone that i have
to form this magnificent
body, God's work of art
my temple
my transport to this
place
i feel the greatness of
the Creator
of such beauty
and grace
every woman falls
before my knees
and beg
for pleasure
