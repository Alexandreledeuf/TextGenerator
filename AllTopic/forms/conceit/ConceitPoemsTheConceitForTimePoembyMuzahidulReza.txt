The Conceit For Time
February 5, 2020
Time is universal
For the universe, multiverse, superverse
And for its beings and things
But Creator is out of time concerned,
He was, is and shall be forever the same,
He has created time
For the purposes of His entire creations and creatures
To count their ages and lifespan
So, how many years they will last He knows,
As He is the Regulator of all these and time,
He is the Sacred
Free from companion, consumption,
Slumber, sleep, snooze and more
As He is of all's only Creator and Savior,
Time can noway touch Him,
He has created time
For the happiness and sadness of entire creations
In time for their deeds
They shall be partly or fully pleased or sad,
But time can never touch Him.
