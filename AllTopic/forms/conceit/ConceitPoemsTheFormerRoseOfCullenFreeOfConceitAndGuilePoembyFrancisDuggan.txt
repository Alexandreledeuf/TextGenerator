Her shoulder length wavy  hair was chestnut brown her eyes blue as the sky
On a clear and sunny day in Summer in the warmth of July
From her Duhallow Village she traveled far away
The former Rose of Cullen where might she be today?
Did she marry bear and raise children or as childless and single did she stay
And does she use anti aging creams and hair dyes for to cover time's decay?
As many aging women do in their battle against time
For beauty it is quick to fade in women past their prime
The former Rose of Cullen in her prime was lovely to behold
She would now be in her early seventies one could say getting old
In my memory she remains young and i picture her again
Walking hatless in the Village her brown hair blowing in the wind and rain
She left her Duhallow Village to live in the U S A
When the hawthorns of the hedgerows wore their white blooms of the May
The former Rose of Cullen free of conceit and guile
A beautiful young woman she did have a lovely smile.
