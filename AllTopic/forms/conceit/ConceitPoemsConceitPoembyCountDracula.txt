Flashback of witch's trials,
I hear the screams of Satan's child,
While searching for this mangled breed,
I have learned that death runs wild.
Chaos, death, pain, and blood,
Witnessing sanctuary rotting away,
Trapped, enslaved to this satanic flood,
I watch as the meaning of life turns gray.
I walk on the ground deceased,
The soul of death now shatters peace,
My souls is dead, I can't retreat,
I live yet die in conceit.
My thoughts of death, my rights concealed,
The suicide of dead soul thinking,
The s√©ance of my lost soul revealed,
The blood bath of twisted minds I am drinking!
