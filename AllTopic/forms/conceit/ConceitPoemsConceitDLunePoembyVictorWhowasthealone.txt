You are a repulsive child trapped in a tangle of your forebears' filth,
Your own shames were unmasked by a stranger,
A careless past rising as an unheeded warning of your vanities,
You grasp at the toys of others, eagerly dashing them to pieces,
As bespoke by sanguine, yet ironically, you stumble amidst a thicker mist than most,
Dessicated and diseased, you hunch as a spider: stealing, binding, and defiling experiences never meant for you........
