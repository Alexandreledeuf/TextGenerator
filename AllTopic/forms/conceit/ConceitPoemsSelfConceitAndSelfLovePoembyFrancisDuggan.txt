Self conceit and self love are a different thing
The self conceited expect others their praises to sing
But those who love themselves love other people too
Herein lay the big difference between the two
Self conceited people are of narcisstic kind
Any excuse for to talk of themselves they will find
But self love quite different to conceit very different indeed
For to be a good person self love you do need
As different 'twould seem as a weed to a rose
Just one way to describe them one would have to suppose
Self conceited people of their own lives only wish to hear
That themselves only matter seems obviously clear
But those who love themselves to others love can give
And without self adulation they gladly can live.
