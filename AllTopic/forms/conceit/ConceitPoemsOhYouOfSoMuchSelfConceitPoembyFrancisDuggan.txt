Oh you of so much self conceit you think that you are great
But with the truly gifted I dare say you do rate
You suffer from a strong dose of too much self esteem
And your ego needs deflating at least that's how 'twould seem.
Oh you with so much self conceit you mistake those with humility
As those who lack in talent or so 'twould seem to me
At your own self promotion you surely do okay
Though empty vessels do make the most noise a wise one once did say.
Oh you so full of ego of you it can be said
That just a little success has gone straight to your head
Than you there are many greater though you don't see it that way
You will not go down in history as the greatest of your day.
Oh you so full of yourself of your success you brag
You surely fit the billing of the arrogant windbag
You are not even the number 1 in your small Country Town
And for you there's a long climb to the summit of renown.
