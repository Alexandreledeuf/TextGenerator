As It Was, Is and Always Will Be,
So Shall My Daughter Always Be To Me...
Beautiful as she is Kind,
Smart as she is Funny,
Caring as she is Charming,
It's really quite Alarming,
That she can be so Disarming;
Eyes of Brilliance and Unique Delicate Beauty,
Containing a Universe of Hopes, Dreams and Possibility,
So Deep, One Can Barely Conceive of An After,
All in All her Smile is as infectious as Laughter;
Her Humble and Gentle Nature,
Belies the simple Truth of her Exquisite Demeanor,
So know your place and Fall on your Face,
For She is a Lady of Infinite Majesty and Grace;
As It Was, Is and Always Will Be,
So Shall My Daughter Always Be To Me...
