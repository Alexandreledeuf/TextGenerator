The air is cooling on the evening breeze
A cold beer in the hand a man at ease
He sits alone amid the failing light
His mind drifting to greet the coming night
And on the breeze the hanging bells now chime
Silence lies broken in the sands of time
In music his thoughts may now rest content
For all is done; silent his dreams consent
To dance once more in the poetic muse
As love and words of dreadful news confuse
On paper to form verse written in rhyme
Silence lies broken in the sands of time
