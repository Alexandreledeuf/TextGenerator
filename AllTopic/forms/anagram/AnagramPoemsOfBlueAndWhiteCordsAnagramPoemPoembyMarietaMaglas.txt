Two-faced, lush, dire nob.
Dear witch fouled snob
The wonderful, acid sob
Chief rat wounded slob
Touch! Refined, sad blow
Deft and slouchier bow
Found cries deathblow
Bounced hardiest flow
Of blundered chaos wit
Boldfaced whores unit
Self-wounded, cobra hit
Wonderful codes habit
Forbidden law touches
Fund bloodier watches
In awful odder botches,
Foul and bored witches
Wiser and foul botched.
Hatred if slow bounced
Arch-foe bout swindled
A witch of so blundered
