8 billion trees to be planted
8 billion trees to grow
In years to come
They to flourish and show
The destruction of earth's rainforests
To be stopped
Those loggers to go
The greedy manufacturers
Scared of losing money
Now threatening people
Who care about saving the world
Saving the earth's atmosphere
Saving earth's animals
And global wildlife
That need the rainforests
In the past
So wrongfully torn down.
The rainforests to also
Provide medications
Without logging trees
For the rainforests
Cleanse our ozone layer
Earth's atmosphere
Needing oxygen
And now we plant
8 billion trees.
Our children of future generations:
The future people
That shall have our legacy
For in the year 3000
We will have rich wildlife:
Rich rainforests
And animals not extinct
For earth is the only planet
Life grows on
Mars desolute and cold
No other planet
To take earth's place
In the dark and emptiness of outer space.
We shall all work together
To enrich the rainforests
And fight the scum
That want to destroy
The world's rainforests
For profit: for greed
And they must be stopped
For earth is an anagram of heart
Which speaks volumes
About the mission
To have all 8 billion people
Work together
And destroy every company
That destroys our precious jewel:
So work hard at school
And realize the loggers are fools.
Earth is the beating heart
Of the universe
Earth is the creator of life
Earth created us:
Its human race
And pollution
Won't take the ozone layer's place
For earth is blue and green
Earth from orbit
Beautiful when seen
And the rainforest destructors
Shall disappear
And will fear being seen
For Mars may be a second earth
But this planet has the greater worth.
Earth is my treasure
Where love I measure
Love for creation
Love for animals
Love for humans
Love for the beating heart
That is life.
Don't wait anymore
Let's work together
And change freaky weather
Earth we must treasure
Earth's importance beyond measure.
