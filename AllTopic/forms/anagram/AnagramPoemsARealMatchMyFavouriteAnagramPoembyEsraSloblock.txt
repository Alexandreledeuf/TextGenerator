Reminded by a look
At my beautiful open book
That the story still unfolds
Of how foundations shook
Laughing, crying
Living, dying
All points in between
And custard pie-ing
Blah. What I really want to say is a very happy birthday to you Tara, my darling. You fill my life with your you-ness and I love you to the very core. Like a stick of rock, if you cut me in half it would read 'I love Tara'. The very  moment I'm without you, I miss you.
I am so in love with you. All my love forever.
