If adorable as adore gloating
Adorable, original, fatso aged;
Good! A safe, adorable trailing,
A dear goofball as originated.
Good! A fair stale load bearing
Adorable of egalitarian dogs,
Fool database or agile daring
A feared aboriginal toad logs.
Alas! Good of aged libertarian;
Alas! Fair, dogged elaboration;
Ago glorified adorable Satan;
So flailed garbage adoration;
Or a garbage, fool and idealist
Of laggard ideas elaboration;
A fool, adorable, daring ageist
Bolder, ga-ga falsie adoration;
Good God! Ease fatal librarian,
Fool ga-ga, idle, sad aberration;
Good! A bold fears egalitarian
Flag, adores ideal abrogation;
Good! Safe, adorable, liar, giant;
Star, ga-ga ideal, fool debonair;
As adored fair, boogie, gallant;
Agile odor and sabotage flair.
