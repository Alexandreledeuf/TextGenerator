Fling-swing!
At every turn
Earthlings dance frug
with frog jumps, step taps in Irish,
Split second leaps, belly moves in cartwheels
of can-can in threescores years and
ten - in gloom men dance pole
and waltz in bloom
Fling-swing!
Freak-break!
Dudes across the
Globe forever dance lungi
Moving on streets - Hope rocks as smiles
Peep at our face - Hap jigs as our mood
downswings With a weep - in
Lives joys or griefs
Freak-break!
Dance-dance!
Hunks everywhere
Dance boogaloo, waltz and
Cocolo - unbar your mind, mercy, love
Kindness dance in people yet in
Others cruelty, vices
Guile, crookedness,
Dance-dance!
(Success and his mistress distress dance, in many ways
hunger dances or otherwise anger dances cruption in
corrupt mind dances trapped on it poor people dances
Dance, dance it's for soulful dance, if you see
some other type of dance just sing and dance
Let others not see the pain in your heart
so dance and hide it with unfailable lips on which
smile Dance dance tune your steps towards eternal dance)
