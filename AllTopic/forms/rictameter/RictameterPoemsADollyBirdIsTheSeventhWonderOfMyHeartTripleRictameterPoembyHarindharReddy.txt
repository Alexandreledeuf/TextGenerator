Zounds-rounds,
Daffodils, CLEAR
Rills with musk-roses fill -
A feast to eyes of the earth -
Rubens smirks at your adult shapes - hilltop!
You're apple of my eyes - stars
On the sky, birds on trees,
Yow, you're my love.
Zounds-rounds!
2
Trill-brill,
In you, I saw -
Glissando of Rehman's
Pipe and romantic muse of Blake,
Yet, it's the beauty of your love that fills.
It's your swanlike walk, Gilbertian
Talk and curly curves made
Me crazy Lee.
Trill-brill!

Yikes-zoiks,
Above all is
Small - You have a slender
Waist, a kind soul, a sweet smile, a
Cute face, fond heart, heaven's charm with Nature's
Grace. Holly-hock, a DOLLY
Bird's the seventh wonder
Of my heart, wow.
Yikes-zoiks!
