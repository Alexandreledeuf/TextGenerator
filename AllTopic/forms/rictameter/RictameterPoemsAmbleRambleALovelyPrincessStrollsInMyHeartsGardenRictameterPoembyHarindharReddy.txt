Heartthrob!
Lovely princess
Strolls in a garden, I
Followed her, awed with a splendid
booms of the freshest hue: reds, pinks, blues, and
Browns - hellows to dainty fellows
Waving to delight me
In the twilight,
Heartthrob!
Drum-thrum!
How to tell in
Love I fell with you, swift
Drifts me dancing thru the sky
To show bluebells from the valley, lotus
In the clear rill and stars in the
Galaxy as sunny
Hours flint by
Drum-thrum!
