Strolls-rolls!
Krumpers move in
strutter walks with stomping
feet while arms swing in electro
Soulful! If Jacks come across a strange dance -
Hiding pain in the heart by lips
infallible with smiles
In the life, grief
Strolls-rolls!

Disco!
Dance in corrupt
Minds with a bait: fish, and
A hook: mesh thrown into water
Being trapped, poor animals shake their legs
With reverse turns perform a sword
Dance: Harakiri in
Life - a diverse
Disco!

Class-mass!
Flap hands, tap feet
Shimmy arms, freeze and break
Themselves with bunny hops Johnny's
Drop in Charleston with circus fetes of
Success with his wife distress, while
Doom tunes steps towards eternal
Jig in lives of
Class-mass!
