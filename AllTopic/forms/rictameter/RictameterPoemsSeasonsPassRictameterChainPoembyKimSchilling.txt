Ice storms
wrap crystal sheathes
around sleeping woodlands
bringing life and light to those who
would image the splendor of God’s artwork
and see beyond the destruction
of such cold and brutal
falls of last night’s
ice storms
~*~
Melting
arrives with Spring
as buds shine beneath glass
waiting for their time to peak up
and greet the world in all its radiance;
bathed in sun and showers to grow
until drought takes hold and
leaves look like they’re
melting
~*~
Cool gust
brings in crisp fall
and relief from dry thirst.
Clouds fly over waving goodnight
to Mother Nature as she prepares Her
stem children for Winter’s coming
around the bend to put
buds to sleep in
cool gust
