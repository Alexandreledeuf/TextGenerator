my beloved feet
telling the tale of my
truth every swirl
I can read a little
itÂ´s winding currents
The whole nest on the song
tumbling down waters
pondering, bending towards
In quiet waters
the bright green reeds are in
the dark mirror of
the sun dancing in currents,
is journeying light
nest hesitant, heavy,
the flow of dark, full water
