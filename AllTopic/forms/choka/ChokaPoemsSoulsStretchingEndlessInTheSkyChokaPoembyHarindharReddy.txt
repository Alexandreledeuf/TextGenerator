Heavenly bliss: Just
follow nature’s hallo, hug
the trees, feel the breeze –
know stars live in galaxies:
oh! those little lamps
in multi colours, gosh! in
between lives black holes:
our dead souls stretching endless
n the sky, hear to
sheep’s tong-ting, swim in the blue
seas then universe
open doors for you even
by cracking walls and
shaping your soul – Or visits
tsunami with a gift, death!
