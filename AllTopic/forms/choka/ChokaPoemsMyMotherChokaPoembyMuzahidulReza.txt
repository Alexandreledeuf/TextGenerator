My mother, my mom
A great woman in the world,
Talking, behaving in great
Great in caring me
And in sharing my feelings
I cannot forget her word;
Behavior she does
The concern, caress she does
That absorbs the every pain
Stored in my heart
By her motherly made heart
Only one in the whole world;
So how my heart can exchange
With what her heart possesses.
