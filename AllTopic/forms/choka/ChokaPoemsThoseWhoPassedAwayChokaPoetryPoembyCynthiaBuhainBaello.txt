Remembering them
with everything that blesses
hoping to contain the thoughts
purified by tears
mellowed by time eternal
random pictures from the past
of childhood embrace and love
separations, longings for
those who passed away.
For my parents who passed away in 2009,  and 2010 - with all my love.
