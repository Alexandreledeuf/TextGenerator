she is the love
and take out the airbag
a sudden wave
I take off the rose
the blow pipe pluck
to water, which suddenly
break best joy,
is silver born in summer
her struggle is harsh,
the girl say having seen
she is come back
rises up tired eyes,
unchanged the moon
but when the laughter moves
sky is seeking me
and it opens for me all
the doors of life
My love, in the darkest
to my lovely
opens, and if suddenly
see my blood staining
the big stone of the street,
because laughter
to the sea in the fall
your laughter must raise
