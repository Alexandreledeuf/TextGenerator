Queen Anne's lace starts to
Curl inward her 'birds' nest', and
To close upward her umbel.
Her spines of love fruits
Are snow-white. Her pink shyness
Touches the lips of the sun.
These lips are bees, and
He drinks her nectar. His teeth
Are caterpillars eating
Her leaves of passion.
Each white flower has two seeds
To make him still desire her
And her hairy stems
After blooming in clusters.
