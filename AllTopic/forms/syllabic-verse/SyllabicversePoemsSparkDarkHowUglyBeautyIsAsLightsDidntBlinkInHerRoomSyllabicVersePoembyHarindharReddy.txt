Zoom!
Her eyes
Are cute
Butterflies,
Her smiles are worn
By Niles flow, roses
Blush on face her jettblack
Cascading hair entwined
Men, when she catwalked like Emma
Stones billion hats are Thrown, million
Hearts are blown - Lovers brought her
Pain, she ducked but wasn't freed
How dark beauty is!
Only her shadows
Could hear scream,
LIGHTS didn't blink
IN her room!
