(Hari-syllabic) (Edited Version)
Zoinks!
Slowly
And gently,
Blooms appeared - dressed in
Zillion hues, filling
The air with spellbinding
Aroma. On each bud, a
Dewdrop, the pearls jigged in the
Bebop. To the tunes of twigs and leaves
The blooms discoed, a salsa in the sun.
Nature bestows life to the beasts and humans too.
Gawk!
I chanced
To pluck a
Rose but, lo, a
Spike pricked me for an
Attempted murder case
As I tried to axe her life
Just to please my ducky cute. We
Reach flowers to claim their beauty, but
Their spirit dies and they mourn when we cut.
Nature brings freshness to all but man shocks it - boo
Yow!
Gardens
Are to sport
Their splendor in
a regal show but, lo,
we cut their limbs and sing
them a dirge - Violets, Blues, reds
and yellows, too have a soul in
the meadows. To view is their beauty,
to grow plants is our duty, hey mackerel.
Otherwise, nature warns man with Tsunamis, boohoo.

Hari-Syllabic is an experiment using an existing syllabic form: Etheree, consists of 10 lines of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 syllables respectively.
However, I added 11th line with 12 syllables giving it a unique shape and form in this poem of triple stanzas! Thanks, I hope you like it.)
