Reza Syllabic Verse - Nostalgia
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Friends, playground, lake, crops field; bird, fish catching,
Going to school, learning and playing,
Gossiping, class bunking, what not
Always cling to heart and mind,
Calls of companions
Crossing heart reach in.
