((1)) Rogue-a-vogue Stop Those Spinning Mills
Birl spins
The globe! A non
Sense vehicle's nonstop
cycling in a circle of the
circus: LIFE: a drama with no fullstop,
Just a comma - go up or come tumble-down, be
Humble: YOU: on lucent days glint, on mumpish nights,
Take a dint - life's 24/7 burning on www wheel
Giant with big tops, steep slopes! Stop
those pinning mills stupid,
You are a rogue
Sturm-drang!
((2)) Who's YOU on a Mango Tree: A Riddle
One, two
Three, feel you free
Still if berries won't drop
Drop it thrills: YOU: mount up
mango or coconut trees to tang sweet
Fruits or tender nuts; your fur is so soft with a
Zebra's zigzag stripes fused with black and light glint! You
Have eyes so round go and cover the ground
and swiftly drift on trees countless
I see you: a small thing!
Who's YOU in the
Riddle!
