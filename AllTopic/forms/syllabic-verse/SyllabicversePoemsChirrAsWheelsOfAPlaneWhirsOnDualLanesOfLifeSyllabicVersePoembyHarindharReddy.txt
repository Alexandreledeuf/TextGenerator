Chirr
LIGHTS on
plane Whirs
On dual lanes!
Life has been a
Round the clock ratrace,
Cycling in the circles
with circus fetes in nonstop
Flapdoodles and an action packed
Two-in-one drama with trauma and
and hungama - On lighter days: Swiftly
and merrily life's sunny hours flint by, hey
Gratefully, cheerfully as they fly with sparkly
Green flints and blue glints Versus life on darker nights:
Dark thoughts are jammed at a junction with Punctured
Tyres where fuse's blown, filaments are cut, fire's
Extinguished ow! Life's chasing a black
cat in the dark room in dark night
With light off while a mocking
birds mock and wolves yell
gloom repeats on itself
Sun shines and rain falls;
Grin or grieve
Live or die,
Life goes on
With nature's
Bliss cripes!
