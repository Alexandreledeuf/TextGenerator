Comedy team found us and did approach
Among us saw some colored faces,
Put some comments, "You are colored
You are blurred and you are paled,
You are dark, light and black
You are white and pink".
But all the while their faces were covered
With the hard skins and natural furs
Long, shabby, ash, grey, black, brown white
On hands, feet they did cover
Even, uneven path
Seemed they had no bath.
