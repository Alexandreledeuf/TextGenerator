DRAMATIC MONOLOGUE OF A CAT
30 November, 2018
ONCE UPON A SPRING TIME
AROUND APRIL IN 2015
I LOOKED LIKE AS IN PICTURE
THEN I HAD NO MUCH FEATURES,
I LOST MY REAL MOM
THEN GOT A HUMAN MOM
AGAIN I LOST WHOM
AROUND ANOTHER SPRING,2018,
SO, SAD IS MY STORY
HOW I AM UNLUCKY!
TEARS ROLL DOWN SOMETIMES
NEITHER I CAN MEOW NOR SING,
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE MY STORY
AS, IN YOUR MIND IS TREACHERY,
I WON'T BLOW ANYBODY'S MIND
AS THEY ARE SO UNKIND!
