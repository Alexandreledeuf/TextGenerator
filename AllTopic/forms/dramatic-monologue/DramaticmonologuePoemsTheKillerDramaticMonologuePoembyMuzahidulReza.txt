The Killer - Dramatic Monologue
March 5, 2020
I'll kill them!
With gun? Bought from government,
Throwing chemical? Invented by chemists,
Bursting bombs? Invented by scientists,
With knife, sword? Made by blacksmiths,
No, I won't take help from anyone;
I myself will kill them!
Blowing, beating, throwing, kicking
On them jumping,
Burning, choking, crushing;
I myself will kill them!
Biting, chewing flesh, sucking blood
Tearing muscle, putting out eyes,
Hitting with stone, dipping in water;
I myself will kill them!
Breaking bones, peeling out skins
Breaking mouth, teeth, smashing head
Blocking throat, anal, urinary channel.
