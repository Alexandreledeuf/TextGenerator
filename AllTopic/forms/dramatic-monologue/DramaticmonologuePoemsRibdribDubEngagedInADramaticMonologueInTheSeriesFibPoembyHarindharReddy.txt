Tagline: A PERSON WITHOUT PERSONA
(Looked he at the stary sky in the prologue
Went to a mirror and engaged in a monologue
Feelings rushed Without dialogue or epilogue)
Time
Is
Moving fast,
So is my breath as
A hurricane's hurrying me -
I'm dumbfounded in worry and merry like Tom and
Jerry in a flurry of muddled thoughts stuck in mud as my mind's perplexed with goosebumps -
In
My
Memory
Lanes, mellifluous
Jumping rhymes jive in charm as smiles
Thrive with promises spin in handlooms yet I forsee a
Burst of dank blue balloon yet I don't know what's stored: gloom or bloom but I forgot to blink!
Now
In
Me a love
Plane in flight
On dual lanes of the
Sky with the pull of didactic
forces of the universe as on muse I go round!
