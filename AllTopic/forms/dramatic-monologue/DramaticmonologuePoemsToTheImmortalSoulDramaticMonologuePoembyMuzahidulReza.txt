To The Immortal Soul (Dramatic Monologue)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Mortal body talks to immortal soul,
O, immortal soul! O, great soul! !
I cry for you shall leave me,
And without you I have no key;
My all doors shall be close
Slowly I will be lost in these dusts,
Nothingness has surrounded
Once that was known great around;
For long I have to be at vanishing state
Yet with you have been written my fate,
Again at the time of ressurection
In me you shall take your position;
I am your cage
But you are my base,
Without you I have no existence
At your call is my presence;
Your state is mine endurance
With happiness or sadness,
I am pillarless
Standing on your branches;
Have you done well?
If yes, with you I am in heaven,
If no, with you I am in hell
So, see, your deeds are how important!
