I spend my days riding around
My long board remains my vehicle.
I am a young man, just trying to live.
My music is my voice,
And my charm for the passerby.
I am a student and an activist,
A learner and a teacher.
Spreading my words to all who will listen.
Some call me kind-hearted, others say genuine.
My big blue eyes light up a room,
And my smile does the same.
With a boho style, and that be-boppin’ rhythm-
There is much temptation to sit and stay awhile.
Although I never wear a frown, there is something underneath.
I hide it from the world to avoid judgment,
My act is so fake; I sometimes forget who I really am.
Do I live in a world full of a potential?
Well, I could…
But no.
When I go home each night
I slowly nod out,
With a needle hanging from my vein.
And escape to my nirvana,
Just to get away from all the pain.
