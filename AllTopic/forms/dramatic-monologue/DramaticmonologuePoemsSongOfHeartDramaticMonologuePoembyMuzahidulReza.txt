Song Of Heart - Dramatic Monologue

I am, I am
So close a man
Why you keep me far
Why you close your door
I have been ever and ever
Your, what you may think, dear!
Touch me
Without any key
I will instantly open
How you want me, when
Likings and dislikings all are
Quite have been but just your,
Look at me
I am 100% ready
Please, take me in
You know I am alone
In this wide wide universe
An unseen dot is my existence,
I am so small
My brain is so dull
Can not understand you
Gracefully form me just now
Breaking my all that in and out
Keeping no a single point in doubt.
