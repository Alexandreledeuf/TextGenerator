A tender, soft leaf once I was
Sprouting from bud I was watching beautiful nature
Soft sun shone on me
And rain drops drenched me much
Winds always caused me swing
Little birds sat on branch under me
It was spring
I was a single one in many
You, poet could not find me,
If I didn't mention you;
Slowly summer approached
Hardened my softness
That hard sun couldn't harm my face
One morning rain came
Make me much satisfied;
Then one morning many fallen leaves I found
Fall came I guessed
Next morning
I found myself on ground
A yellow fallen leaf;
Then dew drops and snow began to fall
I saw wrapping warm clothes people around;
But I was getting dried.
