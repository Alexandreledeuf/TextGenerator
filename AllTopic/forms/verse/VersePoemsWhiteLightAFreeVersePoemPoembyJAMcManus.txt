My blood-shot eyes blink away existence
Unfamiliar voices roll through my brain
Gravity’s unseen hands pull me to the earth
I find their spell far too charming to fight.
Awful bells start to toll in my head, they play
Their terrible tune of death, so seductively
A searing light of pure white beats at my face
As the tolling draws me closer to it’s calling.
I ascend into a white tunnel shining above me
But my body stays on the cold, hard ground
I’m so free from the burden of my fleshy clothing
So naked and fragile, like a screaming newborn.
My heart’s rhythmic beating calls to me longingly
I fall back into the warm sanctuary of my body
I take a breath and feel so blessed  to still be alive
But all I can think about is the searing white light.
