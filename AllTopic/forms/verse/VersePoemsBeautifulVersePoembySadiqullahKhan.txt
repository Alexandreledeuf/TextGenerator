I want to write
A beautiful verse
In the honor of your love
To spark your imagination
To be sung in the drawing rooms
To come on the lips
Of that beautiful woman
And to get applause
I want to write
A beautiful verse
A verse that teaches morality
A verse that would make you
Tremble with fear of the unknown
A verse that would tell the stories
Of the past and present
A verse that would talk
Of paradise anew
I want to write
A beautiful verse
That would tell my heroes
To bring as many heads
As they can
I want to write a verse
Extolling small men
To make them giants
I want to pray that god
Unlocks my tongue
For an eloquent speech
But of all the things
I want to write
A beautiful verse
For you alone
I want to whisper
In your ears
I want to feel you
I want to tell you
The story of my love
From the beginning
