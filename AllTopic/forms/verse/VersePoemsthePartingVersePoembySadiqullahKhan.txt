The severity of my love to gauge
I counted your kisses on the face of other
Like the one lost in the mist of morning
To find the door of house by the color it carries
The hope that night shall bring with the storm
Hopes of prayers for my love when enough
O separation be not the voices unpleasant
From the silence make sweet the presence gentle
Spread the darkness of your hair on my face
Let my sleep on your arm be a dream in heaven
Talk not of others in the harmony of love
My love has the rhythm of the beats of your heart
The living soul has the last struggle though
I counted the knots of remorse on your scarf
Open to reveal the truths like holy script
My love that has spoken to you in immense
On the silk of your hair up the slanted shoulder
Much a time that my heart has lamented
From the lips that has the redness of cherries
Speak the parting verse below the wet of glance
Homer it is said has spoken of gods
Not of gods but of your love have I sung
Who shall then lift me up to the long haze
Tear my heart to see inscribed your name
