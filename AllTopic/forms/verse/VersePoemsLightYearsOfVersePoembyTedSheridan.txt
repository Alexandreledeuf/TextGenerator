Iambic pentameters of junk and rhyme
Each being a measurement of distance and not of time
Matters not to me
As I count the stars I find...
Traveling as lovers on a voyage
Into the vast blackness of space
Where all words are weightless
And we are freed from their gravity
To describe the loving warmth of the sun
As well as the absolute beauty of the moon
Reflected in our eyes…
