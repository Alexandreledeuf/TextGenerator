your voices of golden verse
wakes me up from deep slumber
as coursed from the dream heartful
rousing the warmth of love endeared
when surfing the beach in a morning early
awaiting the golden sun to rise yet
to delve the dew from the depth of night
dazzling across swaying of the grass as
revered by the mist of the night past.
as you make your day promising bright
and muse over morning to rave up the day
suave and serene yet blazing the love
by wishes to the sky for the blue moon.
let all your prayer be blossomed
and be sparkling with the fragrance
yet scattering like a rain in summer
quenching thirst for smile to the green
when each speckle of desire being blazed
like flairs of a night in blue moon
with the light of success in ascension
being sheltered and safe yet unreasoned.
