Ocean I do not want
to fight a battle on
your mighty realm,
no swords in my hands
to flash a spark
at your glowing crown
I am not a gladiator to
fire at you or wage a
war on your domain
I want to light only stars
luminous and crystalline
camphor for incessant fragrance
I want to swing on your
mesmerizing passion
bless me with kindness
to radiate a rhythm that pleases
souls, bless me on my head
I want to praise your tidal waves
allow me to float my little canoe
