‘The sky is encompassed by clouds.
With the hue of Tamā la trees
darksome appear the sites of woods.
This dear Kā hnā
feels very timid at night.
O Rā dhā! You therefore please
accompany him to reach home aright.’
Thus by the words of King Nanda,
stepped ahead both Rā dhā and Mā dhava
towards the tree of bowers on the way.
Glory to their plays of love, secret and gay,
on the bank of river Yamunā.
[Translated from  Jayadeva’s  Sanskrit Kavya “Gita-Govindam”]
