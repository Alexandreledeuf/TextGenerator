Whistles the train
Boring a hole
Into the midriff of the still air.
Bon voyages
Raised hands
Waving handkerchiefs
Pledges
Promises
Prayers for a safe return
Suns
Of kisses
Freezing on lips.
Unbetoken'd
Eyes moisten
With dew drops.
Whistels the train
Boring a hole
Into the midriff of the still air.
