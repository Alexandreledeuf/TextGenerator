How I yearn to write in free verse,
Free from rhymn, cadence and
Free to roam about ethereally,
In some never-never land.
The muse of Erato is upon me. I have an urge,
an urge to write with vagueness and abstraction,
to cloak my meanings in surrealism and mystery.
Perhaps, I could write of passion, joy, sadness,
despair, longings, angers, envies and doubts. I
could write of depressions and elations, using
platitudes and beatitudes. I must write of sad
yesterdays and hope-filled tomorrows and tell
of my misty dreams and future schemes. Ah! -
Yes, these would be good topics, free from the
shackles of rhyme. My sucess depends on your
ability to interpret what I have written. I may yet
become the Picasso of poetry.
But when I take my pen in hand
To write new poetry,
It still comes out in rhythmic form,
Dear Lord, please set me free!
