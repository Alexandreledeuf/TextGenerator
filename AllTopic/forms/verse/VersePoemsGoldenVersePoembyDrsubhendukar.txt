your voices of golden verse
wake me up from the deep slumber
as coursed from the dream heartful
rousing the warmth of love endeared
As surfing the beach as morning delight
when awaiting the golden sun yet to rise
to delve the dew from the depth of night
love as yet dazzles across swaying of the leaf
as revered by the mist of the night.last
when you make your day promising bright
muses over morning to rave up the night
suave and serene yet in blazing the love
wishes to the sky reasoned by the blue moon.
let all your prayers be blossomed hue
and be sparkling like a fragrant rose
yet scattering like a rain in summer
quenching thirst of smile to the green
when each speckle of desire raved up yet
like flairs of a night in the full moon blue
with the beams of essence in ascension
being sheltered and safe yet reasoned too.
