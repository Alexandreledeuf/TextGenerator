From the pit of my coldness
You burn me with acid-filled glares
Like I am nothing but garbage left to go stale
Out here I have no shelter from the rain.
I wander hungrily through familiar streets
Looking for somewhere to belong
I am labelled as a leper amongst the sick
For you do not want to see or hear my pain.
As I stand in the doorway of my despair
I watch the world from itâ€™s shadows
I have become a phantom with no hope
For I have ran out of people to blame.
