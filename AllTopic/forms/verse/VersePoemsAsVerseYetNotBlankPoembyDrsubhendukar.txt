Verse yet not the blank
blanketed by  the smokes of fire
as when frayed
by the fangs of desire,
love is not blank
as  verse of the heart
yet not the void vile amuck
as glanced inhered sovereign
as the rhythm into the river
as the love is yet mightier
than pen as when wrought
by the inkling of love as passion
