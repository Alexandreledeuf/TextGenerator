‘The sky is encompassed by clouds.
With the hue of Tamāla trees
darksome appear the sites of woods.
This dear Kāhnā
feels very timid at night.
O Rādhā! You therefore please
accompany him to reach home aright.'
Thus by the words of King Nanda,
stepped ahead both Rādhā and Mādhava
towards the tree of bowers on the way.
Glory to their plays of love, secret and gay,
on the bank of river Yamunā.
