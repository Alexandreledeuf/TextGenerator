Rising
From a tribal mindset
To a politically conscious society
With rights and responsibilities
Defined is how this community will grow.
Being ethnocentric is not in the interest of any one
Except for keeping an identity and feeling of togetherness
The collective aim here is to advance in minds and spirit
From the basic humanism
To a conscious achievement of well defined objectives
We shall neither be the battle fields
Nor cannon fodder for global
Regional and local designs
Waziristan is our motherland
And carries to us the holiness of any sacred land
We some times must respect the wisdom of elders
And also some distinguished persons
Who are giving exposure to our youth
Both at the national level and international level
Poverty lack of education unemployment
Gender discrimination are just a few problems.
This community has all the potential
Of being a modern
Viable
Deeply cultural
And seeking to play its role
In modern civilized world
