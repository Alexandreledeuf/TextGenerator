no matter how much it seems to hurt,
it happens again and agian
tears are running down my cheeks,
saying that i'll regret this.
no matter what happens,
i'm always alone.
with no one on my side,
but i'm not alone,
others do the same.
what will happen when we are done?
with nothing left,
my heart cries out, unknowingly,
with no reason for misery.
it's like the death of an angel,
all over agian,
in the silent screams i hear.
