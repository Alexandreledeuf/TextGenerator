As women are full with their
unborn children, so it is that
I am filled with my unborn words.
As a mother who loves her child
that is yet to be seen, so to, do I
yearn for words which are unborn
and lie in darkness.
I say to myself, 'come to the light,
come forth from me, that I might
see you...so that I might see my
child that is born of thought.
