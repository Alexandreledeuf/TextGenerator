Consummate pain
Like a cruel wrench
Gripped his heart
And crushed, it bled
A father's tears.
No words define
His anguished grief
A wretched loss
His own son...
His seed.
The baby he carried
In his arms
And nurtured
In paternal love
Now broken, scarred
A shriveled man
His father's eyes
Now bleed.
He would take him back
To be his child
Return him safely
To his past
No war could touch him
Hidden there
His eyes see through
An hourglass.
My boy, my son!
What have they done?
Your life a mangled mess
What's left to do?
These father's tears
Will not replace
The boy, the man
That I once knew!
