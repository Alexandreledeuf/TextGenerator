Long day at school,
Dark and gloomy
.Everyone is pulling my last nerve,
The nerve that can not stretch no more.
I’m all out of drugs, marijuana, cocaine,
O well the weren’t helping any way.
Why do I take them, I don’t understand
My level is still the same.
I open the door to this dump of a room,
Finding the nearest knife
The darkest corner is never here
In the day time it’s all light
I sit on my bed,
Making regretting scars
On the vein that I have last
Redness appears,
But that’s just the stress that I deal with in a day I
’m bullied and tossed all over the field,
Acting like I don’t care
The colours of the rainbow are changing for me,
From brightness to grey
Now, I’m bleeding all over the floor
But the real pain hurts inside
The hearts that’s broken can’t beat without you,
Bearing to stay apart.: (
