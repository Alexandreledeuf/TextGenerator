He walks alone,
In misery of others.
Hiding in the shadows,
Of the schools walls.
When reaching a trip home,
Swallowing what’s called a drug,
There are always different kinds.
A fierce battle is fought when he gets home,
More loss’s than wins
Against his parents.
For them he is nothing,
Just what they have produced.
16, but money is what they dread to give.
Topple over to his room; find a corner that’s dark.
Blood gushing out, from a cut that he’s made
Revealing they stress, for that single day
Why is he different, can’t be the same,
He did exactly like the drug dealer claimed.
BUT WHERE IS THE FAME,
HE WANTED SO MUCH.
If he thinks he deserves it,
Think again, not believing your luck.
There are other ways, which he could get friends?
Give me a second; he should have used his head.
Now staring down on the scars he regrets,
The numbness will never leave his body,
Slowly as his head changes colours,
He went to deep sleep,
The sleep where one can’t be woken.
Congratulations, my sleepy head,
Now you’ll be remembered, recognized.
Isn’t that what you wanted?
Or maybe in a different way,
Wouldn’t it be better getting a job than laying this way?
Rather than how you handling your parent this way.
But what could you do,
When everyone around
Has been doing the things that they call
“Popular.”
Not necessary to fit in,
When you are hurting yourself.
Be a team on your own,
It’s lonely, but, it’s the only way to protect you.
Hearing about the break ups,
The hook ups, the crowds
The girl friends and boy friends,
Can’t have one, that’s no shock.
He is laying dead, some where,
Look at what these people have turned him,
Living a life in high school, not easy.
