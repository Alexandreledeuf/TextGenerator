(THIS IS THE 2ND PART, THE CONCLUSION, TO WAKE ME UP CALL, SO THAT NEEDS TO BE READ 1ST.)
IF I SAY SHE...I REALLY MEAN ME
I WAS NOW INSANE..REALITY WAS GONE
MY MIND WAS SPLIT IN 3
OVER WHAT HAD JUST GONE ON
A 3-WAY SPLIT OF PERSONALITIES
BCUZ 4EVER WAS GONE, MY SENSE OF REALITY
MY MIND RACED, AS I WALKED IN CIRCLES, AS I PACED
I HEARD THE SHOWER TURN OFF, HE WAS DONE WITH HIS BATH
MY LIPS CURLED UP INTO A SMILE, AND MY MIND HYSTERICALLY LAUGHED
WITH MY HEAD AND HEART SPLIT
BROKE INTO 2...
THERE WAS A WAR RAGING ON, AND NOW I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT
NEVER B4 HAD I BEEN, MEEK, TIMID, BY NO MEANS SHY
I WAS THE TYPE TO ALWAYS HOLD MY HEAD UP HIGH
BUT THIS NEW FOUND CRAZINESS, HAD FORCED ALL REASONING...GOODBYE
HE ENTERED THE ROOM IN JUST A TOWEL
HUMMING TO SOME STUPID TUNE
WE HAD HEARD ON THE RADIO, EARLIER THAT AFTERNOON
SHOULD SHE CONFRONT HIM OR WAS IT TO SOON
HER MIND AGAIN RACED, AND ONCE AGAIN SHE BEGAN TO PACE
SHE NEEDED A PLAN
TO OUT WIT A CHEATING MAN
MY MIND SCREAMED OUT HERES YOUR CHANCE
ACT LIKE YOUR IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE MAKING, SOME ROMANCE
I TURNED TO HIM WITH BILE IN MY MOUTH
'I NEED TO GO AND FRESHEN UP, CUZ IM IN THE MOOD FOR NORTH AND SOUTH'
IT WAS OUR PET NAME
FOR THE 69 GAME
HE GRINNED AND SAID 'YOU SHOULD OF CAME IN
THE SHOWER
I WAS IN IT FOR PERHAPS AN HOUR'
I SO BADLYT WANTED TO SAY
I WAS BUSY SPEAKING TO THE TRAMP, YOU LAY
BUT INSTEAD WITH RAGE I TORE OF MY PANTY AND THONGS
AND IN A SECOND, NO NOT EVEN THAT LONG
HIS MANHOOD STOOD ERECT.AND   HE START WHISTILING A DIFFERENT SONG
'LETS GET, IT BABY'
'CUZ YOU ARE ONE SEXY LADY'
I WALKED PAST HIM, NAKED, AND SO FREE
I HAD SUCH A BIG EGO, THE WAY HE WAS STARING AT ME..
OH REVENGE IS SO BITTERSWEET
I JUMPED INTO THE HOT SHOWER, AND LET THE HOT WATER RINSE AWAY
EVERYTHING I COULD REMEMBER, THAT NASTY WOMAN HAD TO SAY
AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES
HE WAS IN IT
THE BATH WITH HER
CUZ HER EYES WERE FILLED WIT TEARS, HE SEEMED LIKE JUST A BLUR
SHE WISHED HE'D DISAPPEAR
WITH A LAUGH
'I SAID DO YOU MIND I AM TRYING TO TAKE A BATHE
HE CHUCKLED AND REPLIED, I WILL BEHAVE'
IN ALL OUR NAKEDNESS I WILL ONLY SPEAK THE TRUTH
'DONT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IM IN LOVE YOU? '
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS...I STILL GET THIS FEAR
THAT I WILL WAKE UP ONE DAY AND YOU WILL NOLONGER BE HERE
ALL OF IT
, YOU, ME, AND US, WILL JUST DISAPPEAR
IN A MATTER OF MINUTES
BOY I THOUGHT, HES REALLY LAYING IT ON THICK
HES LAYING IT ON STRONG
HE MST KNOW IM SICK
AND SEEN MY BROKEN CELLPHONE
HE ALREADY KNOWS THAT THERES SOMETHING WRONG
I SIMPLY ASKED HIM WITHOUT BEING RUDE IF I COULD BE ALONE
HE DID IT WITH HURT IN HIS EYES
AND THEN I STARTED TO CRY
BCUZ FOR THE PAST HALF AN HOUR
SINCE THE TIME HE GOT OUT OF THE SHOWER
IVE LET MY RAGE
QUIETLY STAY IN PLACE
BUT NOW IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO LET IT GO,
ALL ABOUT HIM AND HER, MORE THEN I WANTED TO KNOW
AND DEAR LORD, PLEASE LET ME BE SRONG
BCUZ IF THAT CHICK WAS LYING, THAT MEANS THAT I AM WROMG
ABOUT THIS SITUATION
AND THE CONFRONTATION
OVER, WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED BETWEEN ME AND THE OTHER WOMANS CONVERSATION
I WAS ABOUT TO FIGHT
WITH THE TRUE LOVE OF MY LIFE
ABOUT A PHONE CALL
AND AN AFFAIR THAT IM NOT SURE EXSISTED AT ALL
A FIGHT
THAT WOULD DRAG OUT THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT
WITH A MAN, SHE HAS JUST PROMISED EARLIER TO BECOME HIS WIFE
AND TO HAVE BELIEVED IN EVEN MORE
THIS COMPLETE STRANGER
SHE NEEDED TO KNOW B4
SHE PLACED HER RELATIONSHIP INTO DANGER
(VERSE #1-NOT CHEATING)
'I WILL MAKE THIS QUICK, AND I GAVE HIM A BLINK
YOU GOT 1 MISSED CALL, AND A VOICE MAIL, I THINK'
I STEPPED OUT 4M THE SHOWER, AND SWEPT THE BEADS OF WATER AWAY
SHE TURNED THE WATER OFF, TO HEAR WHAT HE'D SAY
HE WAS YELLING AND SCREAMING
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING? '
SHE HEARD HIM SAY GIRL, YOU MUST BE DREAMING
YOU DID WHAT, GAVE HER A CALL
NO WONDER HER CELL IS IN PIECES, AND THERES DENTS IN THE WALL'
AND JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, SHE PROBALY DIDNT BELIEVE YOU
CUZ IF SHE BELIEVES IN ME, SHE REALIZES THAT YOUR SOMETHING I WOULD NEVER DO...
GIVE HER UP, BY BEING UNTRUE
HELL NO, NO WAY
SHE DONT CARE WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY
SHES NOT STUPID, SHES NONES FOOL
SHE KNOWS IN HER HEART THAT THE LIES
YOU TRIED
TO TELL HER WERE SO UNTRUE
'LISTEN VERY CLOSELY, I LOVE HER WITH ALL MY HEART'
' I LOVE HER WITH ALL MY MIGHT'
IN FACT IM ABOUT TO START
MAKING LOVE TO HER ALL NIGHT...'
THE REASON I STAYED BEHIND
THAT NIGHT AT THE BAR'
WAS SO SHE COULD CLEAR HER MIND
AND SO THERE WOULDNT BE ANY TYPE OF WAR
IM NOT A VIOLENT MAN, BUT IF I FIND OUT WHERE
YOU STAY
AND DRAG YOU BY THE HAIR
AND MAKE YOU APOLOGIZE TO MY WIFE ALL DAY
'WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN, HE LET OUT THIS ROARING SCREAM
I TEXTED YOU WHAT..C'MON PLEASE
NEXT YOU BE CLAIMING, THAT I GAVE YOU THE DISEASE
THAT YOU CLAIM MY BEST MAN GAVE TO YOU
BUT NOW I REALIZE, YOUVE BEEN UNTRUE
YOU ASKED ME TO STAY THAT NIGHT,
AT THE BAR
CUZ YOU AND MY BOY HAD A HUGE FIGHT
AS DID I WITH HER
YOU CALLED ME EARLIER, FOR AN OPINION ABOUT MY BEST MAN
AND I TOLD YOU I WOULD CALL YOU AFTER I TOOK A BATH'
AND HOW DID YOU GET MY LADYS #
OFF MY BOYS PHONE, I WONDER'
'NOW IM HANDING THIS PHONE OVER TO MY BABY....
YOU REMEMBER MY SEXY HOT LADY'
YOU BEST KISS HER BUTT AND START APOLOGIZING
BEFORE I CALL MY BOY UP, AND TELL HIM BOUT YOUR CRAZY BUTT LYING
BETTER YET IM CALLING UP MY BRO....TO LET HIM KNOW, THAT HE HOOKED UP WITH A DIRTY HO....
TO LET HIM KNOW THAT HE BEST START REALIZING
THAT YOU ARE TOTALLY INSANE
MESSED UP IN YOUR BRAIN'
SHE MUST OF HUNG UP, CUZ HE YELLED HER NAME
THAT WHEN HE THREW THE PHONE DOWN AND CAME
INTO THE BATHROOM
AS SHE STOOD THERE And shook with shame
'i swear to you, she is crazy...
and her days are #ered and marked.
I PROMISE SINCE THE DAY WE MET'
IVE ONLY WANTED YOU'
YOU N ONLY YOU HAVE MY BODY, SOUL, AND HEART...
PLEASE DONT 4GET
SHE FELT SO NAIVE...
BUT SHE KNEW IT WASNT TRUE...
SHE KNEW THIS MAN....NOT HER
SHE KNEW NOW WHAT TO DO
CUZ IN THAT INSTANT...WITH ALL OF HER BEING..SHE BELIEVED..
