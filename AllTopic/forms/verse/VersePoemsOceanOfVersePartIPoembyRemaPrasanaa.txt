Ocean, when I walk near you
I do not wear a shield or
arms to guard me
from atropine arrows
from directions where
I placed  roses and lilies
Ocean of verse,
I want to grace you
with idioms as pleasant
you please to hear and
I place near you a
magical box full of
aromatic chamomile...
fumigate me and my heart
to scribble words
to praise you....
give me a few pearls, corals
and don’t tame me
with your violent waves..
