Intimacy – To Put It Delicately,
Is Closer Than Flesh Can Form
And Stronger Than The Desire
… It Bravely Springs Forth From
Intimacy – Shuts Door
On Separated and Shy
Intimacy Knows Who You Are …
And Doesn’t Need To Ask Why
Intimacy – Is More than A Touch,
Sight, Smell, Taste Or Words Heard
Intimacy – Vanquishes Alone
Unknown and Scared
Intimacy – Is A Certainty
And So Beautiful To Have and Hold
Intimacy – Is Secrecy Shared
Between Love and In-Love Souls
… Intimacy …
