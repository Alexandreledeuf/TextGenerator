What's the use hats off, when the person died,
What's the use of message which came after tide.
When hopes were dead & died every thought,
What's the use of message if the messenger brought.
O Heart! go away from here and destroy thy notion,
What's the use of it if thou did after motion.
Alas! had we seen our goal alive,
What's the use of it, if achieved after life.
Worth seen were the last moments of 'Bismil',
What's the use if the people saw it after thrill.
[translated by Dr.'Krant' M.L.Verma]
