Our days are swift, and age affects our lives -
the essence of our character and traits.
Though thankful as another year arrives,
We haltingly approach the entry gates
Concerned about what destiny awaits.
Cast off this uninvited guest of fear!
Grab hands, and leap into the coming year!
Draw near the gate with courage - boldly delve -
Embrace the future, lift your glass in cheer,
And turn to Him who holds your Twenty Twelve.
