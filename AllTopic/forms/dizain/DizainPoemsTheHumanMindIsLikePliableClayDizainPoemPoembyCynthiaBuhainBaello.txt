The Human Mind Is Like Pliable Clay -Dizain Poem
The human mind is like pliable clay
Easily formed by many views received.
Stored in it are various thoughts each day
That we encounter, absorb, and believed.
Minds filter, sort, reject what is perceived.
What we feed our mind is what we become,
Negative thoughts harm many, not just some.
The mind is fragile and can be damaged.
Like clay deformed, it can be dull and dumb,
The result of wrong choices it engaged.
