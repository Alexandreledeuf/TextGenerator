Poetry is a group of words with soul,
Woven in rhyme or free verse, there to say
Some feeling,  sense or meaning as a whole
Not random words laid out in disarray.
It is like painting using words that may
Create images in a reader's mind.
A glimpse of the writer's mark so defined
As it is read there flow thoughts and feelings
Parts of him as an artist there we find
His poem is an artwork of his writing.
