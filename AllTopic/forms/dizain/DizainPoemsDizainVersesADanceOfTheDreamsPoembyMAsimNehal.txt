Sing with the heart and dance with the soul
keep all smiles, magical words will flow,
The happy feets will join your show and roll,
Call from far, near, above or below,
So, fair old tunes be enjoyed by low,
Body will dance in a maze of to-and-fro,
The like minded pairs will come and go,
Triumph will return with fragrance of glee,
The moments of life will increase a row,
And dreams will say- we are now free!
