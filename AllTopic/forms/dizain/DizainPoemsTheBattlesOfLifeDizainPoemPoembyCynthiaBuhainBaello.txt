Amidst these gripping times in which we try
To live unscathed by human fears that bind,
There is in us the hope we can't deny
A sort of light, a beacon in our mind.
While life has trials there so intertwined,
We bravely sail through rough seas day by day
We're in this ring to fight, fight still today,
And though marred by pain we still stand our ground
Until the day when in our graves we lay
Battles fought... and our final peace we've found.
