I've always thought there's beauty in silence,
Restful calm in the quietness of dawn,
Moon shining bright in its magnificence
As the night dances the fleeting hours on.
The soundless masterpiece in time is done,
Notes and images I watched in my mind.
The essence of mute shadows so defined,
Lost in reverie, an audience of one.
Silence has my being there so confined-
What can soothe the soul, only Silence can.
