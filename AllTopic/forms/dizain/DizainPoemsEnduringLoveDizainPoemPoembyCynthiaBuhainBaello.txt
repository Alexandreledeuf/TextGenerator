Love grows free in the soil of Truth,
Watered in time by greatest care.
As it matures it soon bears fruit
For the loved and the loving there.
Love withstands raging storms and rain,
That test endurance on this earth.
Love's not love if it leaves in vain
When dark days come, there's its real worth.
