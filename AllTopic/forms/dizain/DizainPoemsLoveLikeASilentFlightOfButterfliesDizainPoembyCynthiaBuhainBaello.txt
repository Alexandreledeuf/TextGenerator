Love,  like a silent flight of butterflies
Engulfs the naive heart with drowning joys,
And there sings the song of a thousand sighs
To enchant with dazzling hues it employs.
With magic  'round the chambers it enjoys
Conquest,   with every skipping beat of heart.
Flutters to and fro,  in dreams won't depart.
And like the grasp of wine that simply holds.
Captive  lovers  know not when it did start.
Love gives such blissful drunkenness untold!
