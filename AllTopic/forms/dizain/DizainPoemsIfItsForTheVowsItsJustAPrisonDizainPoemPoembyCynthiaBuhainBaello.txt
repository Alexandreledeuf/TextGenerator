You want to leave,no words are left to say.
Letting go is hard but I must move on.
A river of tears cannot make you stay.
If it's for the vows,it's just a prison.
A breath of freedom is enough reason
For goodbyes to be said,to heal our hearts.
Pain may torment but in time it departs,
Scars don't hurt, they're what lessons are about.
Just don't step on shards of my broken heart,
When you close that door and as you go out
