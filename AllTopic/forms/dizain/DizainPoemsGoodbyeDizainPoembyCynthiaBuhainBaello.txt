Goodbyes are just life exits made to be
Unlocked when time dictates a self-release.
For some do pain and drain exceedingly,
No sadness cloaks Goodbye, it dons on peace.
One takes back life when ties that burden cease,
Like birds set free fly through an open door.
They reveal there's a reason to live for.
Unchained of all the dreadful wounds and hurt,
Goodbye's the wind that blows and makes one soar,
Goodbye's the rainbow embracing one's worth.
