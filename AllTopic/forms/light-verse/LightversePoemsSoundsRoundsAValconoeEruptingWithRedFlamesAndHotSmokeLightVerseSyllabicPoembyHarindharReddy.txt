Sounds
Greet in
Rounds! A
Poem explodes in
Words that float on
A boast by shooting
Right out of brain like a
VALCANOE ERUPTING with
Flames red and hot smoke into the
Blue sky colliding with orange
Fragments of lightening in
Inner core of the mind-
Making perfect muse:
A gift to
Unwrap with
The LIGHT to
Delight souls!
