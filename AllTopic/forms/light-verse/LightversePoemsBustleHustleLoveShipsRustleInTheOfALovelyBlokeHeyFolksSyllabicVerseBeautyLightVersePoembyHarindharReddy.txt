Lovely...
Jubbly Charlie!
you cast a spell on me, in
An encounter one, moon turned world
Aflame in silver hues - I go bundle
On your magma-red hair tumbling on shoulders, light
My life with your eyes: plasma blue gems slumbering
In milky pools, Rubenesque figure with
Slavic body! Bustle hustle
LOVE ships rustle in the
Heart of lovely
Bloke, folks!

My chick!
I get a kick
by your syrup-sweet lips
lilac tasting potato chips!
My soul goes miles for 1000 megawatt
smiles flashing shiny halo white teeth that lit up
my world! Take my breath with Your slavic face, acorn
cup chin my heart's blown at your curved shapes where
Ripe fruits are grown, bustle hustle
LOVE ships rustle in the
Heart of lovely
Bloke, folks!

Ohhhhh! My
Lovely amore
I'll tell you more! Honour
I your amusing manners, Fell
Fell for your voice's dulcet, fluty as finch
Songs - You are my A-Z: Heart's desire, life dove, wild love,
Treasure trove, world, one, only sunshine, a dream come
True, only one for me and my reason
For my living, hustle bustle
LOVE ships rustle in the
heart of lovely
bloke, folks!
