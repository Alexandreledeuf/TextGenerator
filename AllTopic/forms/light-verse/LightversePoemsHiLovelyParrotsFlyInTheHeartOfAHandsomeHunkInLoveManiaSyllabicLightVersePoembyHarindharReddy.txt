Oh my
LOVE deity,
Rock my world with beauty:
Your comely figure with imp-thin
Wasp waisted body in sleek apricot
Skin while strands of russet brown tumbling hair lands on
Arched neck, frames your slavic face, gives me a kick! Take
My life with your fleek galaxy lemur
Blue round eyes, burns with hypnotic
passion makes me getting
off on, in the
Trance zoinks!
Spellbound
I'm by your lips:
Beeswax soft calmine pinks,
Tastes like rose petals! When you smile,
lily-white calcite teeth gleams: a bulb blinks
In my heart by tinkling nerves in verve! I'm bowled by
Round fleeks that cover the ground with steep-slopes and
Hill-tops? hips! A brisk-walk on sleek gold skies?
Your Thighs, glides to the end where two
Teak tall trees, live? Your legs!
Hats off to your
Beauty!
Captived
I'm by your fab
Temper, spreads to oceans
Fish thrive with Wow! I yearn for your
Sweet lilting voice of red tanagers' songs!
Enslaved I'm by your odorbs traits: charm birds, flies which
On trees' boughs live, beasts beneath them in love, both fill
Thrill in nature's lap! Your good manners blend
Sun-rain on earth: humans live, love
As wind blows! I bow down
To your beauty
In love!
