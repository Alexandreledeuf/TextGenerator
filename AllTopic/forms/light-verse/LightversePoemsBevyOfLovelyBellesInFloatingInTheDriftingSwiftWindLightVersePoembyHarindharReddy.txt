Oh!
Bevy of
drop dead
Gorgeous belles:
Pretty as pics
With soft cheeks, hot lips,
Engaging grins, charming
Faces, curved shapes, lissom Waists,
Nubile figures - for you I'll tell!
What's there in your curved shapes? Beauty
Misses geometry - what's there
in those figures? Nothing more
than numbers - water's tasteless,
Wind's shapeless,
Together they
Shape our lives
Filling light!
