((1))
Head heels
Over I fell
In love smitten by your
Junoesque figure beauty: Shaped
Decanter waist with Waif-thin body in
Ochrous hue skin - I'm bowled by star-beam gold spools of
Hair swooned down your drop dead gorgeous moon shaped face: chick
hides a swan's neck! When you smile: oyster white
Teeth lit up room, kills my senses
Five! I ain't be a drone!
You're my girlf, I'm
Your boyf!
((2))
My Heart
Skips its beat, by
Your fine-spun Eyelashes
Eased down to Silver moon eyebrows!
You hold key of my heart with your sea-nymph
Ears, pixie's nose! You stole my Soul with those leafy
Eyes: two beryl green gems, melts into snow! You take my
Breath out with your hips, curves into Figure
Eight, down runs to two thighs: nice oh
Guys, ends in legs: twin twines!
You're my girlf, I'm
Your boyf!
((3))
Bitten
By oxbow your
Lips: hot chips, drools goodness!
Your schmaltzy voice has hornbill's trills
With nature's halo! with your A1 manners
Flows Niles, makes plains Where trees, blooms, fruits, live - animals
fleas, bees love - in your eyes, blue-seas live and light-stars love!
Love lift me up, light my life on moon, sun
Galaxies, skies, above all men
Yikes Cupid's arrow strikes
You're my girlf, I'm
Your boyf!
