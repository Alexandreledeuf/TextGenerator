My
Stars oh!
Mountains
Beautiful
With water cold snow
white on the rivers,
Trees rocks over Point to
Point with frost LIGHT sparkly clad
Fully hued pretty trees: blues, reds,
Yellows blow in the autumn breeze
With a white fence circling it -
Leaves change to feathers of
Colours: Brown, orange
Pink fall leaves
Slowly from
The trees as
The wind blows!
