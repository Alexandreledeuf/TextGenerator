Teeny
Wheeny stars gleam
And beam in glistening
Light - they bimble and ramble in
Voguish fashion shows, blinking and flashing
Light all the way on the wide blue yonder - forgot
I to tell good night to my heavenly friends in.....
Chromed clothes: slivers, golds glint, yellows, blues flint
And red, green mints playing hide and
seek with you and me on
all days and nights
With love!
2) STARS BLINK & WINK WITH LOVE & LUST FILLING DUST
Itsy
Bitsy sparkling
Stars peep down from the sky
Sprinkling light thru moon sending love
To you and me - Stars blink - wink with love, lust
Filling dust particles at each other during........
Their ethreal cosmic drives on the space, for special
Bond lies within milkyways extended
To galaxies - Have their own roads
Galactic that circle
The universe
In myth!
