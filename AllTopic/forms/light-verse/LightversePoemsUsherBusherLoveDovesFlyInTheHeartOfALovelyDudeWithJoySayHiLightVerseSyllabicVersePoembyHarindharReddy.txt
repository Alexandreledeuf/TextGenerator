Smitten
by love bug, caught
Nancy my fancy With
statuesque figure, sat on elf
Thin body, sylph-like waist glints in suffron tints!
Your arched eyebrows looks at syraph's ears, pixie's nose
Set my soul in raptures! My cams five click wisps of
Rouge-red hair plunged on your Photogenic
Face: adorns pic, hides your fawn's neck
in rare verve! Hi, LOVE doves
Fly in my heart
with joy!
((2))
Bitten
by your smile: white
teeth gleamed, opened trout-pout
Soft, sherbet sweet lips upon chin
coracle, burn my globe in flames! Stare I
At your nebulous eyes green sparkle in Joie de
Verve blinks, inviting me to the heaven! My hat
Tips at sculpted hips up goes on soft blue
Skies: thighs flurries down to legs: tall
Trees, two oaks! Hi LOVE doves
fly in my heart
with joy!
((3))
Love-struck
by your graceful
persona's redolent
Scent of cinnamon in the air,
Spreads to the sea, there fish swim now! In your
Genteel manners wind-rain blend: earthlings live and in
the sun, they love! I'm sold for your sweet dulcimer
Voice: like chromed-rose grosbeaks in the-woods: trees
Saplings bear fruits, blooms with love and
Beasts, worms live! Hi, LOVE doves
Fly in my heart
With joy!
