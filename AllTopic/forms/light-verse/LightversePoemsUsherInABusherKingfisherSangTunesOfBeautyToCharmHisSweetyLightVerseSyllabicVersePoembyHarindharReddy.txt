Zounds-rounds!
Took a Dekko
I, thru my doorsill, rain
Drops popped on dry leaves of longish
Yakka with Krumping jumps - on the mango
tree, a rainbow-chromed kingfisher marvelled by the
Changing voice: normal to falsetto, warbled new
sprung raw tunes to enamour his sweetie
with glamour, song of beauty - I'm
drowned in Joie-de-verve with
heavenly Bliss
Sounds-rounds!

Throb-globe!
Usher I took
a gander at busher
Beside my grooves thru rose to rose,
their loves: the bees were buzzing to tickle
them pink, suck the manna, while blooms swayed calypso
In trance of arcane romance - coaxed by the perfume
I chanted name of a dainty flower
foxgloves blossomed in my bosom -
I'm flooded in the sea
of deific joy,
Tears-cheers!
