cries the Heart.
Love's

Our sweet ecologist —
what will she do with the ants
and the cockroaches, bedbugs and lice
when they want to live in her pants?

Generation Gap
A quahog clam,
age 405,
said, "Hey, it's great
to be alive! "
I disagreed,
not feeling nifty,
babe though I am,
just pushing fifty.
Note: A quahog clam found off the coast of Ireland is the longest-lived animal on record, at an estimated age of 405 years.

The Board
Accessible rhyme is never good.
The penalty is understood—
soft titters from dark board rooms where
the businessmen paste on their hair
and, Walter Mitties, defend the Muse
with reprimands of Dr. Seuss.
The best book of the age sold two,
or three, or four (but not to you) ,
strange copies of the ones before,
misreadings that delight the board.
They sit and clap; their revenues
fall trillions short of Mother Goose.
