(1 & 2)
Hey!
Belle for
you I tell -
What's there in your
Beauty? Minus gravity, it's nonsense!
What's that much in your curvy shapes? Except
For lust it's not
Must just the
Dust in
Bin!
((3))
How
Much your
Complexion
counts? Ruddy is
Colour of mud and blood where love doesn't grow!
((4))
What's there in taste or shape? When Water and
Wind has none! Yet
Together
They shape
Lives!
