To smell Sandal and Roses together, Try sitting near her,
How Sugar coated petals fall softly, talk to her once,
A deep blue ocean divided in two, look at her eyes! !
Something that always make knees go weak, If Shi…. smiles at you,
Shi…. walks past so softly, ever seen a feather floating on air,
Ever felt Earth like Heaven, spend some time around her house! !
Ever felt you have the entire earth with you,
I had her hand in my hand one time,
Yes you are right, no Human can be such, ’coz
Shi…. is an ANGEL, Shi…. is an ANGEL! !
