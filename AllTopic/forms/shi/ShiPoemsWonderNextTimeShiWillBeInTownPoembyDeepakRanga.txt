A Thursday evening unforgettable,
Six months in total, it took.
How come, why? I don't know! !
This time heaven broke down, not hell on me,
Thou lousy place, thy heavenly presence,
I couldn't believe, how could my neighbours! !
Brought to life, all Shi.... touch,
Thy water bottle now means so much! !
Cheek so meek, , hair so well layered, lips so crisp, white nose turned rose! !
Shi.... left, took my all, just left her scent in the hall,
Complain or compliment, smile or frown,
wondering the next time Shi.... will be in town! !
