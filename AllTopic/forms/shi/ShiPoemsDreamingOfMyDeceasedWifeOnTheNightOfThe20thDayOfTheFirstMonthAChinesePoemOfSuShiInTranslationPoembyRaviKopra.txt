Ten years now separate us
since my wife's death
I do not often think of her
still I can't forget
She lies cold in a grave
a thousand li away
Even if we could meet
we would hardly know each other
her face covered with dust
and my temples frosty grey.
In my deep dreams at night
I suddenly find myself back at home
I see her sitting near a little window
in a pretty dress and all make-up
We look at each other, do not speak
tears flow in torrents.
Must it be that every year
I will be thinking of that heart breaking place -
the moon shining brightly and
the thin pines guarding her grave.
-rendered from a literal translation from web pages
Ten years living dead both boundless
Not think of capacity self hardly possible forget
Thousand li alone grave not place say wife cold
Even if together meet must not recognise
Dust cover face, temples like frost
Night come deep dream suddenly return home
Little window properly dress make up
Mutual look not speak, just be tears thousand line
Expect proper every year heart break place
Bright moon night thin pine guard
