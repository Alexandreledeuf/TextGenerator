琴 雪 缘
Strings, Snow and Kismet
琴
雅致，清新
酬诗友，谢知音
月朗星稀，泉边弄琴< br>丝竹拨天籁，幽韵静人心
雁落平沙缓响，渔歌晚唱慢吟
七弦轻拨何所忧，世间稀有此清 音
The strings tuning
Is tasteful, elegant, and refreshing!
For poem-pal and soul-mate thanks-giving
She is playing under the bright Moon by the spring.
It seems that the music is from Heaven, so soul-soothing
Like swallows landing soundless or a fisherman at dusk crooning,
What on earth strikes you to strike lyre? What an unusual melody refreshing!
雪
洁白，微蓝
六边花，舞翩跹
潇潇洒洒，飘落人间
望林木 如画，浪漫诗意现
欲问仙境何处，遥想琼枝经年
年年岁岁忆美景，朝朝暮暮藏心间
< br>The crystal of ice
Pure white under light blue nice
The tiny hexagonal blossom slowly flies,
Facilely and gracefully into the world, and will lyse
All the forests and trees are like a painting with poetic spice
Thinking of the snow long ago, I can't help shouting: This is the paradise!
Year after year I keep recalling the fancy view which I cherish in my heart thrice.
缘
聚散，羁绊
心相印，泪频潸
痴痴凝眸，憔悴红颜
叹情路漫漫，恨愁绪绵绵
试问君归何处，欲知相聚何年
朝朝暮暮近相伴，生生世世共 婵娟
For the predestined kismet
To meet, to part, we are shackled in a net
Yearning for you, tears often make my garment wet
Watching with passion of love, wan and sallow the hearts beset
We sigh for the way to love is long; we hate for grief and sorrow abet
Could I ask you where you are going? Can we make our next meeting date set?
I dream to accompany you day and night, and to have you for ever to do my barrette.
