I miss you more, it's winters again,
Heat is fading, flowers are blooming
Days gone shorter, I work at nights
You never come by, I keep waiting,
Holding hands, those sweet nothings.
Long phone calls, till either went sleeping
Clutching to memories, Shi.... says Move On..
Why, How, with whom, tell me Come On..
I'm not rich, but I have the riches,
My feelings are real, there ain't any glitches,
Stop it, go away, Will You...
Shi.... goes mum, When I say 'I LOVE YOU'
