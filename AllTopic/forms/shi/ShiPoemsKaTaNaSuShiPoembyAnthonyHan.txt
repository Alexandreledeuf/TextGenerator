Ka-Ta-Na with giggles heard
Me and my buddy used to use rulers and say
In a child like voice
Shifting the blade of the samurai
Hailing the name Katana Sushi
We found a restaurant
Went more often with the other homies
Ate the lunch all you can eat only
Pay about 20 dollars and a few ones
You get yourself practically the whole menu
The waitresses are great feels like family
Waiters got charm that others will find different
There's one dude with wavy hair
Nostalgic as if straight from a story
Not one piece like Sanji
But like a herald of bountifulness
Relaxing sounds float among this katana
As I peak at my simple Udon and cucumber rolls
Thinking when I get a job
Ill upgrade to the Unagi rolls
A zen reached at a decent price
Coming out I walked home
Stomach full of liquids that provide health
Utmost joys clear enough to speak
So come one come all to Ka-Ta-Na
Off of Colima and Hacienda Blvd
They also have specials
