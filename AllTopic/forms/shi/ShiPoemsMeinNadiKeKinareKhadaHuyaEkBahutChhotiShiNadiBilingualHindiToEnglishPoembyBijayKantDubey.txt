Mein Nadi Ke Kinare Khada Huya, Ek Bahut Chhoti-shi Nadi
Mein nadi ke kinare,
Ek cchoti-shi nadi ke kinare
Khada huya
Dekh raha,
Nadi,
Kis tarah bahati huyiKalkal kar,
Bahahti huyi.
Manushya aayenge aur chale jayengi,
Par nadi jo rukegi nahin,
Bahati rahegi,
Bas bahati hi rahegi,
Nadi,
Ek cchoti-shi nadi.
Manushya yaenge aur chale jayenge,
Par mein  jo bahati rahungi,
Ek cchoti-shi nadi, ek pahari jahrna.
Standing By The River, A Small River
I on the bank of the river,
By a small river
Standing and seeing
The river,
How does it keep flowing with a murmur,
A flow.
Man will come and go,
But the rivulet will not come to a stop,
Will keep flowing,
Will just keep flowing,
The river,
A small river.
Man will come and go,
But I shall keep flowing,
A small river, a hilly waterfall.
