My first, central element particular,
my second is present wherever you are,
my third is the commonest article far,
my whole represents consequential cigar,
or often accompanies eclipse solar.
My first, often limited, corporate law,
my second sometimes racehorse punters may draw,
my third - exclamation with oh-la-di-dah!
my whole correspond to a circle stellar,
or judicial court before funeral car.
