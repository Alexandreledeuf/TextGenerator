Just another Saturday noon
When men and women
Boys and girls
Some young children too
Along with elder people
Towards homes
Longing for rest
As well as lunch-
The next day
Being a holiday
Common to say
Everyone in jovial mood
The vehicle-
The public transport
Carrying all of them
Coasting to destination-
Though eighteen years
Ever since
It has been inaugurated
And refurbished several times
Certified by transport officers
Renewal period
Still a year left
To be certified again
In spite of minimal mechanical lag
Tolerable enough
To run as normal condition-
When all of a sudden
The driver losing control
Deviating abruptly
As well as turbulently
Unable to bring it
Safe back to road
Plunging in canal
Running in parallel all along
Drowning everyone completely
Desperate to come outside
Windows locked completely-
Very few of them
Totally countable ones
Swimming themselves
To climb to road
Leaving the rest-
So sad to say
And so much a tragedy
To read in news-papers
Toll reaching almost
Little more than two dozens
All of them
Rest in peace!
Questions to God
Remain unanswered-
Whom to blame?
Very practical
To understand the truth
Recalling what I said
Several lines before-
Repeating once again-
"Though eighteen years
Ever since
It has been inaugurated"
Numbers in life-
A jigsaw puzzle
Or a riddle to solve
Perhaps to find
Questions to answer
Whom to ask?
The jigsaw puzzler
Or the riddle solver
