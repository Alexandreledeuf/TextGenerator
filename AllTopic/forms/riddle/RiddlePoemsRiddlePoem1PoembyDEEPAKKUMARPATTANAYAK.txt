Riddle poem-1

I come through your mind
I help you talk all through life
I am your sound
I am your feel
I am as cold as frosty wind
I am as warm as sunshine
I hurt without moving
I poison without touching
I bear the truth and lies
Sitting on your tongue
I am supposed to be your glam
Now can you guess what I amâ€¦.?
