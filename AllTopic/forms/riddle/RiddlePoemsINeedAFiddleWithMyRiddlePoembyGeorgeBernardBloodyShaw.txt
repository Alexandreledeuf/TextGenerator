Would you like to have a diddle on my riddle?
Many a good tune can be played on an old fiddle.
So please fiddle
With my riddle
Give me a damn good diddle, please.
So come on, be bold
Grab hold
Of my riddle stick,
Be quick......
My fire's going out.
Don't take the mick.
I need fuel as does my fire
As does my desire.
I'm only a bloke!
