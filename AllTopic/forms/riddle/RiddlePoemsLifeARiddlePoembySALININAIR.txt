Fen was deep and volatile
Beyond the borders of shadows
Emptiness grooming inside
To proclaim the floppy trenches ahead
But greenery that never prohibited
Revamp the marsh land and get filled
Heaviness that need to plunge
To the width of a lively shore
But the trenches grab that trail
Reassurance that vague sometimes
Always slip to the depth of shadows
There crack that peek sometimes
Necessity that conquest inside
Grit of time that grin for long
Like the empty corner of life
Life is like a marshland sometimes
Graves that grin but mourn inside
Reassurance drive someway
But will collapse in loneliness
As its build on tears of something! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
