Riddle poem-2
- - - - - - - - - - -
I am ruptured and fractured
Broken part of a beautiful whole
Cursed to be swept up
On an unknown shore
Sometimes covering up
To one-half of the sky fair
Tossed between shores
Seen drifting through the oceans
To settle on your skin for a while
Like a cloud like a dust
I am everywhere
Found in homes and streets
And in rooms and sheets
And in your body and mind
Wherever you go
You carry bits of me
The more you have of me
The less you see
Now can you guess what I am?
