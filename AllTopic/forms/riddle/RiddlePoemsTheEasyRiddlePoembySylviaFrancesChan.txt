My Big Secret
constantly as my companion
vigorating my soul
tender and impressing
a true delight constantly singing
deep within my being
would never go away nor go astray
my loyal companion
eversince childhood
throughout motherhood
and all the other hoods
let me get straight
this is no divine person
this is not our God
but the kindest object
for my belly connection per direct
it is a present of Friul (free: yule)
please, think orderly
and not like a kindest fool
constantly Nochola, oh lala
refreshening my soul
vigorating my whole being
Dear God, please don´t tell them
they have to guess the selves
once again, I repeat
it´s oft the same grand beat
please, don´t tweet
just relax and twitter
no gold but constantly glitter
glistening and winking at mine register
i don´t sing just a slight humming
OK, dear people and gentle hearts
what is this riddle I am presenting?
Oh dear, I forgot,
it is constantly melting
on its spot....
