Ever heard the quote: 'Tom, Doc or Harry'?
Well Harry exists but with a diversified last name! !
When spelled - *'left' to 'right' and 'right' to *'left'
It's a bit different -  but those in the know understand the game;
You see Harry's last name is made up...
Just as the 'RIDER' back in the day
'Purple car to your*'left' -  a brown and blue car
Insisting that i was my father's gift came into play;
'Speaking of me this way' was heartless...
'No finer gift did my father have to give? ? ?
Just over a year or two later...
I learned that in the Spring of '79' my father would not live;
There is so much evil in this world still...
As the smug Valentines still spark a lot...
Knowing five boys will be boys - is still wrong...! ! !
So arrogant - - Thinking that they never would be caught;
Tell me please on this verse of mine
Is there a statute of limitations on this type of crime? ? ?
As the warring continue to rage upon the computer page
There will be no kisses from this my tell all rhyme;
So remember all of you Jack(Bass)    & Jills still alive...
Be careful not to again fall down that proverbial hill
For it's guaranteed to scatter your brains...
Would that not be- -a most bitter pill? ? ?
Note * Left means sinister or wrong
***** Some Gift's Are Given. Some Saved For A **Rainy** Day.
All of us have wondered about this...is it referring to someone's
Nest Egg... as the people involved in this ring of control - have done many
Things for profit... drugs, other peoples inheritances et al.
