Riddle poem-5

I can run but never walk
I have a mouth but never talk
I have a head but never weep
I have a bed but never sleep
Yet never do I feel tired
Life to me is sweet, green and gold
I pass through meadows
Happy to see cool cows
And leaves falling green and brown
Upon my breast and crown
While through woodland
I come across rocks that impede
Swiftness of my speed
Though never do I mind
Day in and day out
Racing and racing without
Stopping a little to attain Nirvana
By merging with that wide, eternal place of heaven
Now can you tell who I am?
Sometimes wild and sometimes calm
