I'll give you a clue
I'll give you a clue
Listen carefully now
As I tell it to you.
Without mouth or ears
I can sing out loud
Yet silent I am
When noone is around.
I hide in caves
And can never be seen
Though double I am
When you hear me scream.
I jump of cliffs
And fly through the sky
Though without legs or wings
I must fall and die.
Let me tell you again
Let me tell you again
For I always tell twice
As I come to my end.
