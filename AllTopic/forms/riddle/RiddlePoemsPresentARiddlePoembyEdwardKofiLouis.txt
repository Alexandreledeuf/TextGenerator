Great wings of love! !
Present a riddle;
Great eagle of peace!
Speak a parable;
Various colours,
Meat, heat, heat!
Love and life,
Loveand art,
Leak, peak!
Love and Dreams;
Ways of mankind on earth,
Colours around us;
That which is eaten should be clean! ! ! !
We are very weak because of our sins;
Break your evil acts and live in peace!
Facing the works of the truth.
