My peppery-tongued Duchess couldn’t
let the matter rest – drove her Robin
Hood to despair again; he said for all
that’s fair he couldn’t fulfil her request.
With broken heart & resolve strong she
drove through the night to consult The
Queen of Hearts – and as I couldn’t be
trusted to take her part, not conferring
with Alice in Wonderland. Now my love
& task is to heal my Duchess sister’s
wounds, and through Scorpio, Alice’s
consort, advise strict honesty; I’ll leave
it to him to be self-righteous while I’m
giving unconditional love receiving a
grieving Duchess – alert her pompous
ways conceal a noble beneficence, tho’
people misread arrogance and lack of
respect as a negative disposition – I
know deep within she loves all who
matter to distraction, that her lack of
tact is an innate characteristic which
causes real problems when she shows
love in ways others can’t understand;
they do not try to solve the confusing
riddle represented by a mysterious
peppery-tongued Duchess, daughter
of The Queen of Hearts and Conan

[ORIGINAL: ]
And so my peppery-tongued Duchess
who would not let the matter rest once
again drove her Robin Hood to despair
and he said for all that’s fair he cannot
fulfil her request and with broken heart
and resolve strong, she drove through
the night to consult a Queen of Hearts
Not conferring with Alice in Wonderland
I could not be trusted to take her part –
But now it is my love and task to heal
my sister, the Duchess, broken heart
and though Scorpio - Alice’s consort
advise strict honesty, I shall leave it to
him to be self-righteous while I shall
Give unconditional love and receive
the grieving Duchess - knowing her
condescending ways conceals her
magnanimous beneficence, though
people misconstrue her arrogance
and lack of respect as a token of a
negative disposition - I know deep
Within she loves all who matters
to distraction and her lack of tact
is an innate characteristic which
causes a real problem when she
shows her love in ways others
cannot understand, they do not
try to solve the confusing riddle
Of a mysterious peppery-tongued
Duchess, a daughter of the Queen
of Hearts and Conan the Barbarian
