Riddle poem-4

I dream and dream
Of islands and highlands
Of meadows and woodlands
Of little waves with melodic sound
Of a river sliding downtown
Under the stars and sun and moon
I dream to be in places strange
To see girls wearing pink and boys orange
I dream to say so much
To my Mom and Dad
To my relatives and friends
But I speak silence
I dream to play game
I dream to know her name
But I speak silenceâ€¦..no one me understands
I dream of a sweet maid smiling at me
Of a young lad teasing me
But I lie here desolate and bed-ridden
Living only in dreams
Can any one talk to me
To fill my eyes with tears
And can you guess what I am
So earnestly beseeching you to me care
