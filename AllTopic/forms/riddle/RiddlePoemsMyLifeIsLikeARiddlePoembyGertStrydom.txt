When I look back
at my life
and see how fast
everything pass,
I sometimes wonder why
things happen
and life takes its course?
How many times
my life reflects
things like a riddle,
of which I do not know
the answers.
Still I trust Him
who can make
all things new,
to touch my life
with His love.
