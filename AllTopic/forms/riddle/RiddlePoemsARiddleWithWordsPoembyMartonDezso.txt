When you say matrix
I don't think of Keanu Reeves
Baldheaded and pale
Or about the machines
Taking over humanity and such.
I rather think of much
More simple made
Things not numbers in coloumns and rows
But I think of numbers
In themselfes of course.
When you say msn
I don't really think of chatting
And writing to strangers I just met
If you call it meeting
Connecting on the internet
Using symbols for these and that.
I rather think of a land
I've never been to.
Huge and unexplored for me
Exotic strange and chaotic too.
Now you got all the words
To solve my riddle
Look at the whole
Not the middle
And don't let your thoughts
Racing quicker
As you race. Thicker
Those thoughts must get.
