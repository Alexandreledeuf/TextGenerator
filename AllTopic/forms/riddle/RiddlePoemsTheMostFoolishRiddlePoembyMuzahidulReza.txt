Humans are now slaves of Dreadful weapons
Making, checking, developing are their funs
By them weapons are normally used in
Damaging, destroying, killing, finishing
Weapons cost lives, properties and all
Races, species, civilizations we can call,
Beside piles of weapons graze some people
Just those of herbivorous animals or cattle
Some enjoy luxurious staffs and food
Some are fed back of cursed gun shoot
Some enjoy rhythmic sounds full of art
Some are tired with ugly haunts loud bark,
Humans attempt to cover light with dark
Using weapons so they regularly bark
Barbarous civilizations sometimes hark
Them to make time machine to go back
To learn naked, barbarous civilizations
But to roam in wilderness with modern guns,
Some ugly brains discover the foolish riddle
The others are sweated to answer but fully fail.
