the sun by the sun
can no longer see me to end
can no longer see those
looks of pink
in the eves of orange
and no longer see
the evening kill the evening
the horizon
through the horizon
drink the sky
where it bleeds all light
light by light
to the last single spot
reserving ages
dazzling not a beholder
or a closed eyes listener
a reason in there
always a reason
and for a reason
open...................
was my inkpot
for a reason
this inky poem was written
a beholder, guess why?
you are?
why by why
if dazzled,
o beholder
howmany stars?
or................
what are they?
