I am one of the wonders of the heavens.
I am seen as many objects, signs and creatures.
At times, they see me as a dog, a lion or even a scorpion.
Though I appear in people's view most times,
they can never hold me. I am small, yet enormous, near, yet far.
Many stories revolve around me, oftentimes,
I am associated with the gods.
Travelers seek my guidance as they travel.
I am beautiful, elegant, shining and splendid in the eyes of men.
People wish to earn knowledge about me,
my wonders and my origins.
Although I may not be visible in your eyes at all times,
I am always looking down upon you with my everlasting gaze.
I live long- far longer than any living creature can live.
Yet I am not deathless. I too, lose my light and die.
And my death gives birth to another, a youngster to take my place.
Who am I?
