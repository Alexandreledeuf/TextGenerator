Riddle
Where is the end of this life?
Death?
Then why is so much pain?
So much dream for relief?
Relief is false if death is final.
Where is the goal of life?
Where is this walk to go?
Where this road of life leads to?
Where, where is the ultimate destination?
Life is a journey to salvation,
From outward space to inner world,
From mundane to spiritual,
From life to deathless life.
What does the salvation mean?
Why so much urge to know?
Knowledge is useless in the end,
Death makes everything sod.
Endless is the way to walk,
The pathless is the path,
Through eternity the question remains?
What is life and what is death?
The mystics smile with deep Joy,
They seem to know the truth of truths,
They seem to know the false as false,
They are Knower of ultimate rule.
Life itself is a mystic to me,
Mystery, mystic and misery,
Every moment of joy seems false,
Every moment of sadness mystifies the mystery.
Feelings of love wash the heart,
Feelings of pain wash the mind,
Feelings of gratefulness wash the being,
Still all is hugged with
thin fence of Conundrum.
What is life and it's purpose?
What is death and how it fulfils life?
What is knowledge and it's relevance?
Everything is under the sheath of riddle.
