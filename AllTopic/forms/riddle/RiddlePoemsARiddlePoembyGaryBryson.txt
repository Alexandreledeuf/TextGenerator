Too small to be measured,
Yet I carry great weight.
Like the flip of a switch,
I determine your fate.
I’m a flame burning bright,
But the world cannot see.
I can enslave you for life,
Or from death set you free.
With each breath that you take,
I will always be there.
I’m as common as dirt,
Or a diamond so rare.
I can light up the world,
But my light some would kill.
I will always exist,
For I am Free Will.
