Riddle poem-6

I have a heart and a head
But no body and no blood
Just leaves and no branches even
Still go up to touch the sun
I grow without wood
In fact I grow in the ground
I am nutritious and tasty
And fill your belly
When I am alone
Without bean, tomato or onion
For your lunch or dinner
You just peel off my layers
And munch, munch, munch
Oh, am I telling you too much?
Then tell me what am I?
For I am a garden queen pretty and shy
