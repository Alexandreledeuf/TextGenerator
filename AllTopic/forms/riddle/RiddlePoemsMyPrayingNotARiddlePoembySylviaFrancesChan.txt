MY PRAYING, NOT A RIDDLE:
Praying for reality
i pray for the people in need en in sickness
i pray for reality
in this cold and foggy vision in midwinter.
this praying must cool the flames inside.
that blazing fire now is still a firing flame.
i pray for a happy reality.
that my life and theirs are alright,
that everything will work out.
the time i shut my eyesin that sleeping time,
between dream and reality
to when i open them again, i can feel a blissful harmony
in day's reality before facing my love and my duties.
praying helpsto just forget every hurt and grief for a time,
and have a clear connection with You, my God, my Saviour
afar from sin and death
close to our good health
to let go of the past and the present
to drift now into the future.
i pray for a life and love healthy and true
so that they can feel alive and be easy-happy
not for today only
i pray first for them, then for me
as long as they and i live
to live in a bright shining day
in greatest harmony
as long as they live and love each other
is my praying too difficult or too much my Lord?
to ask humbly for my own happiest moments
my own is also their own happiest events
their is a word for people i innately love, care and cherish
i expect Your Support my Lord and Your Bliss
this is my prayer and all there isâ€¦.
