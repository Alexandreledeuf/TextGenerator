The  Riddle  of  Cosmos
The  singularity   of  the  Universe—
the  Bing  Bang  rang
ten  thousand  million  years  ago—
was  the  theory  propounded—So
the  scientists  in  unison  sang.
They  set  themselves  to  find
the  important  property  that  did  bind
all  matter  to  confer  its  mass,  size  and  shape.
The  riddle  of  the  cosmos  to  solve
the  physicists  did  evolve
"The  Standard  Model" of  Particle   Physics.
Fundamental  particles   twelve
of  this  theory
and  fundamental  forces  four
save  gravity
govern  the  dynamics
of  the Universe.
In  an  invisible  ubiquitous  field
through  the  entire  Universe' energy  field
permeated  an  influence  called  Higgs field.
In  Particle  Physics
with  his  work  on  quantum  mechanics
in  the  Universe'  over-all  dynamics
our  Indian  scientist " Bose" is  seen
having  worked  with  the  famous  Einstien
to  have  brought  out  the  statistics, ‘Bose-Einstien'.
This  earned  the  name  ‘Boson'
for  a  sub-atomic  particle
for  a  force  carrying  article.
By  the  English  physicist  Higgs
it  was  postulated
in  the  accepted  "Standard  Model  of  Physics"
that  a  missing  piece  existed.
In  the  jig-saw  puzzle
called  the  Universe
the  missing  piece
was  the  particle  ‘Higgs  Boson'
now  dubbed  the  ‘God  Particle'—
since  ‘tis    everywhere  and  powerful
yet  so  hard  to  find  and  full!
The  European  Organization
For  Nuclear  Research (CERN)
took  upon  itself to  learn
and  detect  the  elusive  particle.
(LHC)  The  Large  Hadron  Collidor
in  the  tunnels  at  a  depth
of  One  hundred  and  seventy  five  metres
was  built  a  looped   pipe,
for  a  length  of  twenty  seven  kilometers
below  the  Swiss-French  border.
‘Tis   the    world's  biggest  Physics  machine
where  research  stations  numerous  sheen
are  stationed  underground
where  thousands  of  scientists  are  bound
working  all  through  day  and  night.
For  this  gargantuan  experiment
USD  forty  million
has  been  spent  by  Indian  Government.
The  pooled-in  brains  and skill
of  twenty thousand  scientists  around  the  world,
(with  hundred  Indians  playing  a  role  substantial)
have  built  these  pyramids  of the  21st  century.
Two  proton  beams
are  accelerated  by  the  LHC  deeds
to  very  high  speeds
to  collide  at  the  allied
speed  of  light.
Quarks  and gluons
inside  the  protons
collide  and  explode
with  high  energy
creating  the  ‘Higgs  Boson'  epiphany.
In   trying  to  unravel  the mystery
behind  the  structure  of  the  Universe
two  laboratories  at  CERN
took  upon  the  mission
to  work  independently
and  bechanced  at  the  same  decision.
The  discovery  so  desperate
for  the  new  missing  particle
lends  a  unified  description
of  the  disparate
forces  of  Nature's  inscription.
This  announcement  historic
by  the  observation  conclusive
of  the  Higgs-Boson  particle
till  now   elusive
was  made  in  an  atmosphere  electric
on  the  fourth  of  July  2012—a  Wednesday—
A  red - letter  day!
This  is  not  the  end  of  the  quest
but  ‘tis  only  the  beginning.
For  it  is  incumbent
on  the  scientific  community
to  crack  many  more  riddles  best
that  form  ninety-six  percent  of  the  Universe
like  Super-symmetry, Dark  energy,
Dark  matter  and  Anti-matter
that  stay  unresolved  unto  eternity.
