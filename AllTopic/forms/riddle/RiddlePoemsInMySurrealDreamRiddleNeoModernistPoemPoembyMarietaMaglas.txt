Irreversibly, the yellow of the sun slips into
the leaves. Placidly, they fall from the Jabuticaba trees to the black
ground. Imperceptibly, I'm falling
asleep near you. Thereis cold, cold, and
a new autumn enters into my surreal space.
As long as
the trees are yellow, the life is insecure.
Undoubtedly, my roundland of love is
riddled with hate.Steely,
there is a riddle of
hailstones in this autumnal scent of flowers to break
everything around. Unflappably, I am stronger than steel, when
I have a will to survive. You're still there
behind the waterfall that spreads fear. Panicked, the night
falls when the moon pulses light.
There are shadows in the darkness, and I
cannot find the way out.
Where am I? Where am I?
