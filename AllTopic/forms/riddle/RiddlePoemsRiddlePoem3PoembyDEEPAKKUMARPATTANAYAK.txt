Yes I matter
People call me flower
Some rose and some sunflower
I may be fairly called
I may be fitly called
Or I may be properly called
I am served summons
I am lodged complaint
I am hold accountable
I am hold responsible
Also I am complimented
With sweet bouquets
I am remembered
When lost wind moans
On me holiness bestowed
And I am christened
Lest to the world
I might remain unknown
Yet I am what I am
I own all of mine
But others use it more
Than I do
What then is it my dear?
