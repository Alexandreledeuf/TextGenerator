My life was dumb and dull
Used to see in black and white
Then she appeared, my angel
Now rainbows all over my sight
My life turned meaningful
More than that so colourful
She paints my heart
With her brush of love
Now my heart so colourful
Like a million rainbows
(mouth the word COLOURFUL to your ladylove / lover and she / he will solve the riddle for you)
COLOURFUL
COLOURFUL
COLOURFUL
COLOURFUL
COLOUR FUL
COLOURFUL
COLOURFUL
one for each colour of rainbow
