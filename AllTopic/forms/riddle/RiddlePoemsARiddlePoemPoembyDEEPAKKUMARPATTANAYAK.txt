A riddle poem
- - - - - - - - - -
Nodding a polite face
On a chilly December evening
It warms you up
Close to your glossy-dull surface
Of your skin, it cuddles up
Through your fingertips
It laces to make a nest in your heart
And claims younger lungs at last
It rings around your face and nose
And seduces you to its addiction close
Its prey your delicate mind becomes
As after your oxygen it runs
It's the black child of a white father
A wingless bird flying
Even to clouds further
Closer to it you come, you shed tears
Spending for a moment with it
Makes you feel cool and collected
As in ignorant bliss you are left suspended
But the longer the company
The greater is the chance
To be withered at its hand
Now tell me what it is, my dear friend
