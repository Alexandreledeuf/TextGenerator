A fiddle with my riddle
Sometimes in the middle of the night....
Not much to do...so...
I'll have a fiddle,
Get it going,
Turn up the heat.
You can't beat
A good riddle.
I don't need to look at the mantelpiece
As I poke the fire.
I can now fiddle with my riddle
In the middle of the night.
Tho' I'm old
I can still do it twice a night......
