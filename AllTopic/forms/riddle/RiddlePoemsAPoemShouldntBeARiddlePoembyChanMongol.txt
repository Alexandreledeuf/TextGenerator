A POEM SHOULDN'T BE A RIDDLE
The truth is, do in the season;
Various farming and plantation.
Not every month but once in a year;
When conditions and climate favor!
In the history, many wrote riddle;
They were not understandable!
Still, they were liked by elite people;
Horses were found in the cloud by all!
I even don't understand their poems;
Elites approved their ignorant games!
Falsely regarded as poets worldwide;
Without constructing rhymes, they died!
Now, look! I have a different style;
To understand, none walks over a mile!
No hardship and very simple;
Because, a poem shouldn't be a riddle!
A poem shouldn't be made in a laboratory;
A poem should be natural, ordinary!
It is, what a poet sees what a poet writes;
No need to push readers for fights!
The truth is, do in the season;
With right farming and plantation.
To write, don't linger the entire year;
Write when condition and climate favor!
I even don't understand their poems;
Elites approved their ignorant games!
They are regarded as poets worldwide;
Readers are real thinkers to guide!
A poem should be obvious like a season;
Readers should be aware of cultivation.
A poet cannot be a rocket scientist;
Very simple, soothing and naturalist!
