The Rainy Day Riddle
How many raindrops up in the sky
Does it take to say that it's raining?
Can it be just one? Or must there be more,
And by knowing, just what are we gaining?
The answer to this you will soon know,
And I hope that it gets you to thinking,
Cuz thinking will help your brain to grow,
And if it's not growing, it's shrinking.
If the droplets are far too many to count,
You can say that it's raining a lot,
But if you count one dropp all alone,
Then it's raining in just that one spot!
Now picture a downpour so severe,
That there are countless drops to be seen
Did you know it's really not raining at all,
In all the dry spaces in between?
So here is a rainy day trick for you
To help you find all the dry places,
Look up at all the drops as they fall
And try walking in just those spaces!
Now if you were to say that this was 'clever' or 'cute'
Yet you feel it has no real meaning for you,
Then I'd say it's a way of looking at things
That can help you the whole day through.
For when your days are drizzling the doldrums
And seem dark and dreary from showers of strife,
If you just can't find your way out of the storm
Then just dance between the raindrops through life!
