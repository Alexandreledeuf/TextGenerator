â€˜Enter without yr shoes'
I see written in yr throne
but when you see me at
yr door step you ask me
to enter without putting off,
are you not afraid of to be
ridiculed for breaking the rule
of your own self ? this is  a
great puzzle, what is the
speciality in me so that
you allow me to make yr
room dirty? if you held
me in such a high esteem
would you  then please in
sotto whisper  tell me
the mystic  meaning of
the riddle?
