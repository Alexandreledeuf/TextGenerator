The following Ode is founded on an age-old Tradition, in England,
that when a politician makes an almighty cock-up he is, deservedly,
detached from his b***ocks, or, to use the vernacular: "gets well and truely knackered "!
Weave and wrap and then cry wolf,
Seems you are being wound-up Dave,
There's someone waiting on the hoof,
Or is it Boris just having a rave.
Granted you looked good on a surf-board,
But d'you think your ratings really soared,
When it came to light,
That you were, after all,  swimming in shite.
Speaking  of the blond- bomber, I'd rather not,
When he says: " Get on yer bike ",
Watch-out, and look round a lot,
Or risk ending up, like the proverbial pancake!
He also has ideas on Flight, combined,
With enormous shafting in everyone's behind.
Not quite finished with the Right,
Before shifting  left, for here lies,
Farage star once " burning bright ",
Talks to himself a lot, won't say his good-byes;
Still, talking is cheap, Core-bin snarls,
Time to revive the thoughts of good ole Karl.
What's one to do in all this mess,
There's folks banging desparatly at the gate,
And others who want to leave and join Isis;
As Thomas Gray wrote, and put it straight:
The curfew tolls the day, passing hard,
Sounding an elegy for a country, in a junk-yard?
