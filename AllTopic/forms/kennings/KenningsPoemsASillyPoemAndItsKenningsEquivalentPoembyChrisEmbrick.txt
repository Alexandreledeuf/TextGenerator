Milk cows
chew the cud
rest in the shade
while milk is made
when the farmer calls
head for the barn stalls
for the farmer's sweet feed
gives what the farmer needs
from a full udder
gives rich milk and creamy butter.
Milk mamas
grazing grass grinders
bovine day dreamers
process raw moo juice
until the hay cutter calls
move to the cattle stalls
for sweet dairy chow
yield to the tit drainer
from the bulging cow container
whole milk and cow caviar.
