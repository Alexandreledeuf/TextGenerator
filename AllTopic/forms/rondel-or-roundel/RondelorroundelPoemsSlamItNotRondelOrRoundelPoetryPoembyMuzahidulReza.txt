Slam It Not
Rondel Or Roundel Poetry
January 3, 2020
Slam it not, you angry guys!
It can hit you at back and thigh
See the case, low or high?
Or, merely it is a simple pie;
At low case you do your best
At high case you do investigate,
Slam it not, you angry guys!
It can hit you at back and thigh;
At final gate you arrange a test
On moderate asking is the best
Then you'll find the right in fact,
Slam it not, you angry guys!
It can hit you at back and thigh.
