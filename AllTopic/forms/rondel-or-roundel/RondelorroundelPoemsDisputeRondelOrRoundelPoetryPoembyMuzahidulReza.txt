Dispute
Rondel Or Roundel Poetry
January 1, 2020
Dispute is here, dispute is there
So you can find disputes everywhere,
Some people are born to dispute
Some people try to get rid of dispute;
Some people suddenly involve in it
Some people unexpectedly fall in it,
Dispute is here, dispute is there
So you can find disputes everywhere,
Most of the time it brings bad
Only sometimes it brings good,
But almost always causes misundestand
Dispute is here, dispute is there
So you can find disputes everywhere.
