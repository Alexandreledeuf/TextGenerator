///
hundreds of thousands of words,
we told through our whole life
tens of thousands of sentences,
you wrote in your novel
thousands of dreams,
we dreamed through our passing dark nights
millions of images,
we left in our moving past times
but my friend
at the end,
I carry
only a few images of withered petals
except all those nightmares
yet I can feel a few dreams of yours, repeatedly
even I can recall a few words of yours
that grew the motion of life
maybe you can feel a few words of mine
As  the words that can make a wonderful  lyric
I love you, that holds an eternal truth
yet that shining as a crystal of diamond
