he called me last Sunday
said 'Babe are you free?
deep down in side i
felt chills run through me.
i recalled a touch
then a old memory
i wanted him bad
but he's no good for me.
he's no good for me, Hey
I've been there before.
i don't need the pain
of heartake anymore..
but maybe just maybe
that ain't how it will be
i wanted him bad
but he's no good for me...
I gave him chances
more than i can count
He left me in hartake...
I had to get out..
it's been a long time
feeling lonesome and free
i wanted him bad
but he's no good for me....
he's no good for me
i say i've been there before..
i don't need the pain
of heartake anymore.
but maybe just maybe
that ain't how it will be
i wanted him bad
but he's no good for me......
