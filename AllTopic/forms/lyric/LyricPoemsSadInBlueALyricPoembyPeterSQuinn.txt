Sad sad sad in blue
For sad sad sad you
The moon is all bluish tonight
The night is all dark out side
Nowhere to run
Sad sad sad in blue
Into the night hold me tight
Love me babe I need some light
What's wrong and what's right
When shadows dwell and abide
Sad sad sad in blue
For sad sad sad you
The moon is all bluish tonight
Is there some star shoot in sight
To wish upon
For sad sad sad you
Into the night take a flight
Feelings, touch, everything out sight
Love me with feelings ok
Come come babe now closer stay
Sad sad sad in blue
For sad sad sad you
The moon is all bluish tonight
Is there some star shoot in sight
To wish upon
For sad sad sad you
