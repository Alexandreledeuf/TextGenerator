In a building down off first street
is a shelter from the wind and rain
the reality of winters chill
is why most of them came
i work here, my job is easy
but i find the pressures hard
Because every night, till mornings light
i hear whispers ment for God
Whispers ment for God
whispers in the night
every night till mornings light
i hear whispers ment for God.
The angry ones they cuse him
others ask Him in their heart
some seem not to know Him
as they whisper in the dark
my job here is easy but
i find the pressures hard
because every night till morning light
i hear whispers ment for God.
whispers ment for God
whispers  in the night
every night till morning light
i hear whispers ment for God.
