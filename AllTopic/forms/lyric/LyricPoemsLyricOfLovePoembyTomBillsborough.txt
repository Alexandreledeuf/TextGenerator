Know that to receive is giving.
Your smile reflected in my own
Mirror gestures of the lovers
In which the love is truly sown.
Know that to receive is giving
To taste the sweetness of your breath
To watch your eyes grow wide with welcome
To touch the smoothness of your flesh
Know that to receive is giving.
The subtle pressures of the dance
This close connection now revealing
The rhythmic beauty of the trance.
