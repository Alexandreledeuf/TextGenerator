the singing in the living, listening heart
tells love  in whispers; and the heart is always
listening; for that heart is always bliss; all
hearts in all ways, blest  by ceaseless love;
the blaze of bliss in life is  our soul’s singing;
this peace, our  life as  winging gift that’s blest;
its light brings love, sings peace, and brims  the heart.
