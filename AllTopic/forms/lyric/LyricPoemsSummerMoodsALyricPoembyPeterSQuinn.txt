Daytimes and rain drops
All time through
Something that never stops
Coming to you
Sweet air and water ways
Fragrances of air
Summer moods these days
Are so close and near
Every occasion is going
Somewhere like everything
Like the wind is blowing
In the leaves to sing
Never stopping for an hour
Or giving longings to fill
Morning wakes a flower
In its peaceful still
Night times and dream plays
Playing with sleep
Colorful fantasy ways
All yours always to keep
Everything is flowing on
With somewhere still to go
Nothing is forever done
Walking by fast and slow
Every occasion is going
Somewhere like everything
Like the wind is blowing
In the leaves to sing
Circling around in motion
Summer freshness air
To the shore and ocean
The distances are everywhere
