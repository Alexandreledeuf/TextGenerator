Last i saw her she was drivin'
with the top down on her car
Headed east on Hampton road
Lookin' like a movie star.
that little bumper sticker
on her fender said it right
the tame go wild wild wild
on a full moon friday night.
when the moon is full
the fish are biting
shadows fall in a different light
when the moon is full
the tame go wild wild wild
tonights a full moon friday night.
last she saw of me, was the back of my harley
on rock run road, kickin up dust
headed to a place we go to be alone
just gettin back to gettin back to us.
repeat chorus
tomorrow we'll get back to basics
paying bills, listening to the kids fight
back to work and daily livin
thinkin' bout this full moon friday night.
repeat chorus
all poems, and lyrics posted by me -was written by me....
