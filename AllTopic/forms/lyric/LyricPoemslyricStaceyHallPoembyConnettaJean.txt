STACEY HALL
Every day at sunset, Stacey got behind the wheel
drove down a country road, to a small church on a hill
she sat on them concrete steps, winter summer spring and fall
people drove by all the time, just to stare a Stacey Hall
it's better than a play ground, she told her friends and family.
it's a play ground for my kids, but it's a house of God to me.
One day Sister Susan, called up Brother Paul
said I'm gettin tired, gettin tired of seeing Stacey Hall
she don't belong to our church and I don't like her at all
I think the elders of our church should talk to Stacey Hall.
Well the congregation gathered, as the sun began to fall
and faithfully they all agreed, they'd soon see Stacey Hall.
Suddenly the sky turned black and a bolt of lightening hits
a tree beyond the little church where the congregation sits.
brothers don't judge brothers, sisters do the same
love your neighbor faithfully and praise praise praise His name.
Stacey saw the hurricane, just as she pulled in
and she was glad to see some cars and rushed inside to warn them
once inside the basement, where they was safe and warm
the Elders watched as Stacey clutched Her Bible through that storm.
I say, brothers don't judge brothers, sisters do the same
love your neighbor faithfully and praise praise praise His name.
Now every day at sunrise, Stacey meets with everyone
to rebuild the little church they're working till the settin' sun
the children love playing hide and seek and the Elders one and all
love to drive by their little church, just to wave at Stacey hall.
brothers don't judge brothers, sisters do the same
love your neighbor faithfully and praise praise praise His name.
once inside the new church a book fell from a pew
and there in bold black letters said 'I will judge not you'
