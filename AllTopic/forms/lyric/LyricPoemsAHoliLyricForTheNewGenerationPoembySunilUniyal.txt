It's Holi, it's Holi, dear friends.
All envy let's shun
All hatred let's burn
Forgetting our follies,
We'll make amends.
It's Holi, it's Holi, dear friends.
The winds of change are blowing
A dream in heart is glowing
Drenched in colours of joy and love
We'll together soar above
To new skies, new horizons.
Breaking from the past,
We'll set new  trends.
It's Holi, it's Holi, dear friends.
