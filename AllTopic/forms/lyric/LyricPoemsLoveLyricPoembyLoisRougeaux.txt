What is love?
love is a word
It is also devotion
It is pleasure, passion,
and tenderness
Love knows no limits
Love is perfect, it is attachment
Love is special, it is heavenly
it is kind, sympathetic.
Love is joy, reason, feeling, sacrifice and serving
Love is to care
Love keeps back all things
Love brings love
Love is a great gift
Without love there is no life; loving is living
Living is to walk the earth,
be alive see the light.
