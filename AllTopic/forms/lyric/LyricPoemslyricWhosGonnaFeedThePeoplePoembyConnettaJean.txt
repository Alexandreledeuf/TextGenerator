Jeb Martin lived on a family farm
just out side of Old Jack town.
when a man named Rosco
started nosin his nose around..
200 acreas of rolling hills
views that take the breath away..
When Jeb said' it's not for sale'
Rosco said he'd stop by anouther day...
Well, It wasn't long before the county
started fining Jeb for different things
Like flies and the smell from cattle
and run off polluting the streams....
They fined him for this
and they fined him for that
till Jeb couldn't afford to pay
now, there's 40 homes with breathtaking views
under Rosco construction today...
Mr who's gonna feed the people
when all the farms are gone?
reminds me of the Indians
and how they just moved them on...
The Cost of Beef is going up
cause the farmers are losing ground..
who's gonna feed the people
When Farmers can't be found?
Jessy Ray has a chicken farm
close to the county line...
been in the family 2 hundered years
but now it's all just a matter of time..
they say a man named Rosco
has been nosing his nose around..
talking about views and what he could do
to help bring new jobs to that town
300 acres of breath taking views
best land for miles around..
And their talking bout a fancy mall
comming in on the edge of town..
He paid fines for this.. fines for that
till he ain't got a chance in Hell
tell me who's gonna bring us water
Once we dry up the well?
who's gonna feed the people
when all the farms are gone..
reminds me of the Indians
and how they just moved them on
the cost of eggs is going up
cause the farms are going down..
Mr who's gonna feed the people
when farmers can't be found..
who's gonna till the soil
when Farmers lose their ground?
cause most of them are tilling it
out of love for land passed down.
the cost of food keeps going up
cause farmers are going down....
who's gonna feed the people
once A Farmer can't be found?
