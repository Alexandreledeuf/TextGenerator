In the springtime, when the world was new,
We sat beneath the tree and heard it sing
And in the morning drank the dew
From its upturned petals,
Like liquor from a loving cup.
You sang for us, O lovely tree,
The wedding march and lovers’ songs,
You were my bridal bower
In those happy times
Lined with satin pink.
I wish I could have stayed for ever
In that joyful place,
But the spring, it doesn’t last,
Time, and people, keep on moving
And my lover left me.
Now I sit alone beneath the tree,
Its gorgeous crimson petals
Falling, falling, like my dreams,
Until they coat the ground
Like broken hearts.
Now sweet tree you’ll shade my grave,
And when the spring returns,
As the year go round,
You can sing me lullabies
In my eternal sleep.
