When I was a-dyin', lyin' on the sidewalk,
head split, blood 'n brains a-runnin' down the drain,
my life flashed backwards in my mind, just like they sez it does;
the dog came to life again; she came runnin' back;
the more I hit the liquor, the more the bottles filled;
laffed myself to death I did; laffin' like a drain...
