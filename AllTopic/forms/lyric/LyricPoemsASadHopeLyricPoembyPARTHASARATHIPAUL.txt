while passing through a bad patch
many good claws gift some deep scratch.
gotta bear with all so love bruises
from bitter foes once so dear friends.
they love to hurt so hard in so many lovely ways;
maybe I`ll smile when I am through all these days.
happy to see them kiss the moon
when I go through a sultry noon.
never count all the thorns
that prick me hard in wild pains.
sorry if the hurts go deep wounds
and bring the blood of sad tears.
now I could see your full face
and could glean all scattered grace;
there`s a light in such a night
that opens up what`s truly bright.
if you yet love me the same as ever
you are mine and will be off never.
hope, you won`t fail me in a bad way;
we`ve the same path and that`ll pave the way.
hope, things will be okay again;
as after summer comes the rain.
