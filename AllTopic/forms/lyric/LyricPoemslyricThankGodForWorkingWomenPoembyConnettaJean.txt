THANK GOD FOR WORKIN' WOMEN....
She gets up in the morning
gets the kids off to school
makes him a big breakfest
Lord, he  feels  like such a fool.
cause she'll clean the house leave by 2
won't be back till after ten.
God bless the workin women
holdin' up the workin' men.
Their nurses in hospitals
soldiers in Iraq and Iran
their teachers in the classrooms
Doing anything they can..
it ain't how daddy did it
ain't a 1990 plan
God bless the working women
holding  up the workin man.
my job went overseas
just where i don't know..
makin' 17 a hour Lord
seems so long ago,
daddy always was the one
who made out the budget plan
God bless the workin women
holding up the workin man.
they're cops and firefighters
working any job they can
God bless the workin women
holding up the workin man
it ain't how daddy did it
ain't some 1990 plan...
God bless the workin woman
holdin up this working man
