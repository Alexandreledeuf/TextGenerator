Take my love that’s reaching out
That’s what it’s all about
To be with in and have some fun
And making time outside in sun
Never let it fall away
What you can do today
To reach in with your closeness
And give from your caress
Nobody is exactly like you
And nobody feels the same as you
Anything is therefore up to you
To reach out and become free
Your love makes it all count
If it is there inside found
You may please and you may astound
But everything comes around
If you don’t give of your loving care
Everything from inside there
That will teach someone to reach
With their heart to give and teach
Nobody is exactly like you
And nobody feels the same as you
Anything is therefore up to you
To reach out and become free
Yeah oh yeah oh
Nobody is exactly like me
To show and give of too
Nobody is exactly like me
I want to be a part of you
Yeah oh yeah oh
Reach out to my heart and feel
Everything in this world's reachable
If you give it your best try
The hours are of luck so full
And clear of hope in the blue sky
Nobody is exactly like you
And nobody feels the same as you
Anything is therefore up to you
To reach out and become free
Yeah oh yeah oh
Nobody is exactly like me
To show and give of too
Nobody is exactly like me
I want to be a part of you
