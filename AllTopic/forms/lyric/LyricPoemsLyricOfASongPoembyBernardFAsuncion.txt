K-ind words with rhyme
E-manate from a song of love;
I-t's truly sweet to your ears,
R-efreshing like rain from
A-bove.
D-elightful stanza shows power,
E-arly eleventh of July;
L-ines in refrain or chorus
O-pen the door in the
S-ky.
R-ight inside your mind,
E-ach truth knows no wrong;
Y-ou can feel in your heart
E-very lyric of a
S-ong.
