I look into your dark eyes and I see the light
And the gleam of love so indestructible,
I give you all I am and I hold you tight,
Only with you, my dreams are achievable.
We are within our imperfect universe,
'Cause so deep within we can have everything.
I am at one with you, running in reverse.
You are my desire, and you taste my heart string.
You penetrate me and you change me forever.
You can take everything and give everything.
It's madness when my feelings you devour.
We eat each other, we feel like exploding.
It is a connection between soul and body.
We dance the feelings, the tears and the passion.
In the rhythm of the stars, we need love to embody,
Dance intricately intertwines our vision.
We throw our body language in romance,
Love is a star, losing its mass and ray.
You push the limit to ecstasy and trance,
We dance our dreams of being the same clay.
Dance of Love (Version)
I look into your dark eyes to admire the light
And the gleam of love; it's so indestructible,
I give you all my being and I hold you tight.
Only with you, my old dreams are achievable.
We are within our imperfect love universe,
Because so deep within we can have everything.
I am at one with you while running in reverse.
You are my desire and you can taste my heart string.
You penetrate me and you change me forever.
You take everything from me; give me everything.
It's quite a madness when my feelings you devour.
We trust each other and we feel like exploding.
It is a connection between soul and body.
We dance the feelings, all the tears, and the passion.
In the stars' rhythm, we need our love to embody.
Dance intricately intertwines our deep vision.
We throw our body language in a new romance,
Love is a star that loses its mass and its ray.
You slip the limit into ecstasy and trance,
We dance our sweet dreams while becoming the same clay.
