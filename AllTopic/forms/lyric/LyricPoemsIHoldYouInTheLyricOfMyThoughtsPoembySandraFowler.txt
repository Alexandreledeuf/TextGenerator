In memory of Menke Katz
I hold you in the lyric of my thoughts.
No, never mind that mist that hurts the eyes.
Tomorrow in Jerusalem, my friend,
Our dance beguiles the autumn of its grief.
I have you still with all my treasures kept,
Poor scribbles and the pencil-colored flowers.
Write me new letters on the windowpane.
Sign them as always with your shadow name.
Frost memories give me courage for today.
Just taste October with me, find it good.
The time is poignant like a Yiddish tune,
As bittersweet and smoky as old leaves.
