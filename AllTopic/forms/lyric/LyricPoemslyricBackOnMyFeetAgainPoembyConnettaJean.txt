Back On my feet again.....
Unemployments running out
I'm so tired of interviews
i come home a roll up pennies
watch the news & get the blues..
I won't let these hard times haunt me
Sir, I'm not a quitting man
this economy is lousy
but i'll do the best i can
cause i got God and family beside me
Lord knows how hard it's been
trust in me baby cause you know I'm gonna be baby
back on my feet again....
now i ask you mr congressman
I ask you senator too
what would you do if you woke up
walking in my shoes? ..
could you give up your mansion
give up your mercades benz?
what whould you say if your pay
was what i'm bringing in....
chorus..
I got God and family beside me
Lord knows how hard it's been,
trust in me baby cause you know i'm gonna be baby
back on my feet again..
Mr. i don't need a condo
I Don't need a caravan
all i need is to be right back up
on my feet again...
I won't let these hard times haunt me sir
i'm not a quiting man
this economy is lousy
but i'll do the best i can
cause i got God and family beside me
Lord knows how hard it's been
trust in me baby cause i'm gonna be baby
back on my feet again...
Yes, trust in me baby canuse i'm gonna be baby
back on my feet again
