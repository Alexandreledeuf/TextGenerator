Bonding, but not binding…
now, there’s true love, for you…
fondly done by finding
what joins you for true…
bonding, but not binding…
free to fly in space,
space to face together,
no limits to that place…
bonding but not binding…
these words mean what they say –
trust is just a must for friends, for
love grows strong that way…
