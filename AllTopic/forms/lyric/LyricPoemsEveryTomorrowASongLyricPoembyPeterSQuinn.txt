Every tomorrow is in yesterdays
Like a circling wind in the top of trees
Those come around again in the summer breeze
One time more in their tiding's turning ways
Love songs of the evening to be born
The tide's life is made of forever tour
One, two, three, but nobody knows for sure
Whether a life is all new or out worn
The ocean is deep in its true abyss
And nothing comes back to tell the truth
There is just this time and its first of kiss
The rest is unknown in its eternal youth
Come here and give your inspiration's find
For the road to the on road have some spot blind
