Remember that old fire place
we sat in front of
talking girl and taking
time out to make love
well that fire place and me
we're still keeping company
but lately my desire
is setting papers on fire..
i've been burning up pictures
old cards and letters too
don't need reminders
to remind me of you
I used to want to keep
the memory of loving you
but lately my desire's
setting papers on fire..
remember that old bathtub
we bought at a sale?
sure held a lot of water
oh, the tales that it could tell
well i busted it to pieces
and i put a hot tub there
been getting rid of memories
girl they was every where
I've been burning up old pictures
old cards and letters too
don't need reminders
to remind me of you
i used to want to keep
those memories of loving you
but lately my desires's setting papers on fire...
lately my desire's
setting papers on fire...
