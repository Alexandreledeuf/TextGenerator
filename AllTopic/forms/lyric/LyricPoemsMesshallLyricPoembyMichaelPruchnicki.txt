Like petals on a yellow flower,
all sticky and sweet for the bee-
though each lasts a brief hour,
some essence they share is key
to both love and a simmering stew
sitting on a range in the messhall
which serves victuals to many
and a few who clamor and bawl-
'Where in hell is that damned cook
with his nasty minions from hell
who ladle spoonfuls by the book
to us rankers? We bloody smell
destined as we are to burn
in everlasting pain in our turn! '
And the Lord Barack looked on
from his station in the clouds
and declared it was good
that lesser mortals should learn
the hard way! And it was thus
declared by presidential decree
this January 21st in the first year
of his sacred reign on earth!
