You could hear the back door slam
all the way across town
the night you slamed that old screen door
and the words that you was a saying
could be heard by everyone
saying you don't love me any more..
Baby, you can't keep a war like ours
a secret in this town
small town folks are a close knit family...
it won't make the papers  but
a lot of telephones
are speading rumors about you and me..
but we ain't like the Jonses's Girl
Mrs Jones is so up tight
said she lived her life so long
so wrong it isn't right
but them Joneses keep it quiet
they don't fight much any more
they sleep in seperate bedrooms
it's a casualty of war..
well, no one heard that back door open
but me when you came back in
and no one heard you whisper
that this lover is your best  friend..
Everyone gets angry,
but baby you and me for sure
will never ever ever ever be
Love's casualty of war...
baby we ain't like the joneses
Mrs Jones is so up tight
said she lived her life so long
so wrong it isn't right
but the jones keep it quiet
they don't fight much any more
they sleep in seperate bedrooms
loves casualty of war..
