If you love someone
Then you trust him with your life
When you look into his eyes
‘Cos if he lets you fall
You will drown inside of them.
Like the deep dark pool in which I learned to swim
My father took my hands and told me to jump in
And I held on tight and took the plunge because I trusted him
And knew his love would hold me up and keep me safe.
If you love someone
The you trust him with your soul
When you whisper secrets in his ear
‘Cos if he breaks your trust
You will shatter into pieces.
If you love someone
Then you trust him with your heart
When you press your lips to his
‘Cos if he throws you back
You will dissolve in tears.
If you love someone
Then you trust him with your all
‘Cos if you hold something back
Then you don’t love at all.
