It's easy to misinterpret
When finding different ways,
For life is all of love and hate
And with our feelings plays.
You found a way with words like I,
Yes that's what it's all about,
Continue to let your emotion fly
And you won't be in doubt.
We can all change the world,
Each with our hope and dream,
Just like the wind that's hurled
The ripples in a river stream.
You found a way with love like I,
Nothing more is to be done;
Just don't let your feelings die,
If you want your dream carried on.
It's easy to misinterpret,
Never be wholly satisfied;
But nothing in our life will wait,
Dreams can be disqualified.
We can all change the world,
Each with our hope and dream,
Just like the wind that's hurled
The ripples in a river stream.
