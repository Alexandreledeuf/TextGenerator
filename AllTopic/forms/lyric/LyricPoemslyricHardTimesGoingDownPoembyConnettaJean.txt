I went to pay the bills today
and ask them to give me awhile
to catch up on the ones
way past due right now..
seems like when we pay one
anouther one comes due
Seems the only things worth living for
comes free to me and you...
Daddy always told me
'that love's a rocky road
life is like a field
and you reap just what was sowed.
He said, don't think it will be easy
that ain't reality
Cause anything worth getting
is whats given to you free'...
I'm Daddy's little girl
and one mans woman
i'm Mommy to the kids running round..
i'm a friend and i'm a lover
and i trust God's faith in me
we can take the hard times going down
yes, we can take the hard times going down..
Grandma left me treasures
in a big old ceader chest
nothing anyone would want but me
old pictures cards and letters
her wedding dress and poems
poems she wrote back in 1923..
i'm Daddy's little girl
and one mans woman
i'm mommy to the kids running round
i'm a friend and i'm a lover
and i trust God's faith in me
Yes, we can take the hard times going down..
Yes, we can take the hard times going down.
