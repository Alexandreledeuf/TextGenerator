I can't afford the price of gas
can't eat and pay my rent
spend every day workin'
just to cover what's been spent.
It seems like only yesterday
I thought them cuts should be
but if they were gonna cut somebody
why the hell did they cut me?
Let's take it back to congress
back to the senate
back to the goverment
and the politicians who spent it
let's take anouther vote
cause Lord i can't afford these dues
I got the lookin' for work
Hit by a budget cut blues
we can cut back on the groceries
cut back on the luxurys..
but when comes to lovin
don't be cutting back on me.
we'll turn down the heat
shut off the lights
what gets me through the day
is these budget cut nights.
I don't need the blues baby
it's tough enough paying them dues.
I don't need the blues baby,
it's tough enough paying these dues..
Some  thought it was a good idea
till a lot of folks got burnt
I'm sore because i didn't vote for
the cuts that got me hurt.
Let's take it back to congress
back to the senate
back to the goverment
and the politicians who spent it.
Let's take anouther vote
cause Lord i can't afford these dues
I got them lookin for work
Hit by a budget cut blues
How hards a hard time
supposed to be?
when i need your lovin
don't be cutting back on me.
i don't need the blues baby
it's tough enough.
tough enough paying them dues.
Let's take it back to congress
back to the senate
back to the Goverment
and president who spent it
let's take anouther vote
cause Lord i can't afford these dues
i got the looking for work
hit by a budget cut blues..
the looking for work
hit by a budget cut blues..
