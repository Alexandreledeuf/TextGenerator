I feel colours in poems
Not only words
I feel me there too
And animals and birds
It's a wood deep and evergreen
Not all understood or seen
Sometimes brighter then a morning
Or emotional deeper than an yearning
It's sometimes everything
Then nothing in between
I feel colours in poems
Sure it's all language
But it's this and this too
Always something new
I have seen a tree poem
I have seen a mountain poem
And all the other poems
I nearly understood
I am like a little poem
Just like you
