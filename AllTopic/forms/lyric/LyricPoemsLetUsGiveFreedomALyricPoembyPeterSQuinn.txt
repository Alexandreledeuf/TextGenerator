Dream dream away
But never give up your dreams
There shall come a sunshine day
With fresh river streams
Any hope is my hope
And any joy is mine
Hold on to your freedom rope
Let in all the sunshine
All justice is to give
To make equality
And in peace therefore live
To learn and be
Summer is not a thought
But a fresh new spring
‘Freedom come’ is taught
Together we now sing:
Let us give freedom
For everyone that's in need
Not just for some
That so have plead
But for all mankind
In these days for all
Let us together it find
In our need and call
Dream dream away
But never give up your dreams
There shall come a sunshine day
With fresh river streams
Any hope is my hope
And any joy is mine
Hold on to your freedom rope
Let in all the sunshine
