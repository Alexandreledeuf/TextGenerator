The soft and cold flowing wind
Dancing beautifully leafs of trees,
When it rains happily
River and waterfall also flowing with delight.
See sweet dream of being victorious
The river water flowing as I go,
Restless feet walk forward I go
The mysterious world of sweet song in the vortex.
In the rainy season clouds cry
Thus the rain is to fall from the sky heavily,
The winter season dew sing songs
The dream of sun rise in the east.
Rose flower calls to the butterflies
Feathers fly diffuse to move the butterflies,
The song of infinite life sing the world
New moon, at the edge of new sun.
The longest and far life to the road
Here I am traveling and traveling to,
Rainy wind kisses on my cheeks
For the trip now I don't want to cry.
