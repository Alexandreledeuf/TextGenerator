Oh baby babe give me a sign
Something I can relate to,
Or I'll be walking a strait line
Trying my luck without you;
Reaching the top from the low
Everything's fine here with me,
We further away shall grow
If we to love can't both agree.
Like the times will settle in
With all the reasons and doubt,
Growing apart is a sin
If we can't live here without;
Feelings we gave to both
With arms reaching to hold,
When giving trust and betroth
Searching the warmth in cold.
Oh baby babe give me a life
That I can call of my own,
Searching I've been in and strife
Never to be more alone;
I've meet faces in a row
That never to love shall agree,
Like lonesome wind that will blow
Unreachable down to any tree.
