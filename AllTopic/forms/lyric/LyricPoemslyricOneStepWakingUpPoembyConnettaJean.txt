Jessy thinks she's been a bad girl
too long to talk to jesus
and she can't say that she won't stray again.
but Jesus died for Jessy's sins
Just like yours and mine
she believes and that's a real big step toward Him..
One step waking up
is two steps back to Him
paitiently He's waiting
for hearts to let him in...
Ed lost his job and family
and he wanted to die
but something deep inside of him
kept telling him to try
he knew what he had done
and the man that he'd once been
he said Jesus come into my heart
and Jesus walked right in...
One step waking up
is 2 steps back to him
patirently He's waiting
for hearts to let Him in...
one step waking up......
