There's a place up on the hill top
on a road with cat tails growing in water colored rust..
No houses for miles, just catales
that we was leaving in a cloud of dust..
Now there's a man named Silas
he lived on  a road off to the right...
high upon anouther lonesome hill top
Silas often  prayed benieth moon light.
His job was gone and he felt lost
didn't know where to turn or what to do
then a thought came 'Go get some cat tails
and  trust a blessing will shine through..'
well Tommy woke up early and
by the time the sun went down..
he had 80 nice sized bundels..
And he he took them into town.
Well, the story it goes on and on
just like a fairy tale of old..
He worked hard and made of lot
(them cat tales was like gold)
He didn't have one single thing
he knew to do but pray....
every blessings answerd different
Cat tales was his that day..
