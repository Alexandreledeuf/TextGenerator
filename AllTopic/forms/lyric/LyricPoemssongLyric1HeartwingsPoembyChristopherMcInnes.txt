Heartwings beating on a slender thread
Brushing softly on my lover’s head
As he lies beside me dreaming
Of the way he leaves me feeling
He’s dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, of our love
I’m yearning, yearning, for heaven up above.
We both know it cannot last
The love we felt has now long past
My heart can only bear so much
Until it breaks to feel his touch
He’s dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, of our love
I’m yearning, yearning, for heaven up above.
Love for me was a mountain tall
To climb it I would give my all
For him it was a pleasant game
A diversion on his path to fame.
He’s dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, of our love
I’m yearning, yearning, for heaven up above.
And now for him the game is done
The moves are made the trophy’s won
He can move on to pastures new
While I grieve for what was true.
He’s dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, of our love
I’m yearning, yearning, for heaven up above.
