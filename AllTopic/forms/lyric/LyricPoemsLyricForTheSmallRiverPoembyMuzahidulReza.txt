Zigzag ways
Murmur sounds
Flows and flows the brook
Nowhere does it stop;
Both the sides
Laughs nature,
Both the sides
Much features;
Farmers utilize water
Shepherds swimming go far,
Fishermen fish in it
Barges ply boat,
Little boys and girls swim
And catch fishes in whim,
In autumn the both sides
Are full of abundant catkins
Kiss these the skies
And swiftly fly around the martins;
Autumnal clouds invite
All the catkins spread white.
