Found you sitting there at the edge of the world
Looking out into that dark and lonely space
Of broken hearts and shattered dreams
Tried to look into your eyes
'Cos I caught a flash of starlight there
But you looked away and would not meet my gaze.
So I sat a while and shared the loneliness with you
Knew you felt the pain of empty places
And the agony of falling from a height into a black and senseless pit.
And the only sound I heard in that grim and soul-less spot
Was the splash of tears falling
Wet and hot on the stony ground.
Then I put my arm around you,
Told you how it broke my heart
To see you weeping there, told you to leave your tears with me
And kissed them from your face,
Then sent you home, your loving ones to see
And laid me down to die alone.
Loving you and missing you but glad you weren't there with me anymore
As I laid me down to die alone, alone,
As I laid me down to die alone.
And all the stars went out, one by solitary one,
Till all that was left for me were two bright and distant suns -
The memory of what I glimpsed when I  looked into your eyes
And they smiled upon my face
And made my tear drops sparkle
As I laid me down to die alone, alone,
As I laid me down to die alone.
As I laid me down to die alone, alone,
As I  laid me down to die.
