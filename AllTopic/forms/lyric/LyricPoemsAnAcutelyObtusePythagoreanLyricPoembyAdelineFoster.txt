^An Acutely Obtuse Pythagorean Lyric
Isosceles
was watering
his hypotted-nuse
one day,
When a witty,
wily Pythagorsaurus
wandered out his way.
'A theorem for my hearem, '
Isosceles did say.
'Why Sir, I fear
that  you  will  hear
your roots are very rare.
It seems that they are growing,
but all of them are square.'
'Eureka! '
cried  Isosceles,
'Eureka and Eurare!
We must the news deliver
to the house across the square.
To  leave  a
note for Archimedes,
Who will one day be there,
To  tell  him  why  the  triangle
turned out to be a square.'
