purple violet breaking the gold sand
praising voice in ocean fog
his colour is blue, like you're eyes old light
barrien on the tingles blood crystal powder
not tick, silent, and, death
I blowing it and then trying to gropes
a broken wave gets louder singing
and then that gold sand changed as black
his colour is black, like heave acid
wilting between the raging seeds of sky
not tick, silent, and death
then that grass trying to growing between air
besides the haze progressively close blessing
curing crystal of laureled brown
his colour is brown, like slime lamellar
breaking the falling rain who curing wound
not tick, silent, and death
