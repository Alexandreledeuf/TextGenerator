I love the handsome dote
That you actually down wrote
With everything in the color true
That came to be the same
In every tone you tame
That’s here up and down becoming you
This every word to last
And giving its cleaver play
Each outspoken and cast
That never though for long will stay
Oh dreams in their own dressing
So much unspoken caressing
And giving it all a while
Exotic in their own bottom style
The black and white to last
The ways of every new cast
That’s hard to point out or defile
Each little mold and mote
On black and white note for note
Just what you are singing now
And giving your personality somehow
That what it is in style
And hard to sketch a light in its rile
The game of the game we play
Each night and the coming day
Those others have tried before
And still we can reach for more
Yes all that makes this time new
And gives of its out of sight
Both of everything for me and you
To make it come back alright
This is how it should be done
To make nights of special thrill
To carry the dance on and on
With every personality at will
Everything just got to give in
Everything just got to make a spin
With our feelings line to line
In their hard way to define
Middle of nowhere to now
Managing somewhere to somehow
All is for nothing in tries
Special for decision and ties
Right or wrong in its vision
Neo-realism in colorful precision
