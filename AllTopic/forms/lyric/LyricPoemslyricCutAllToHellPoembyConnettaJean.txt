The cost of living's rising every day
when there ain't no work a man can't pay
when there's farmers not farming and white collars blue in jail
you know the working man just got Cut all to Helll.
You wouldn't want to live with thse unemployed blues
Lord knows i gave my shrare, to pay this countrys dues
Already lost my job, now my 4-0-1 plan  ain't doing well
this working man got cut all to hell..
there's truckers not trucking
and farmers not farming
seems this world has set me up to fail...
From the factory to the school house
Seems like everywhere you turn
This whole world has been cut to hell..
there's farmers not farming
trucers not trucking
and white collars blue in jail
you know the working man
just got cut all to hell'
Lord knows this working man
got cut all to hell....
