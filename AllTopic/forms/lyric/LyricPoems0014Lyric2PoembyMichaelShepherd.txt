The heart so loves to love,
loves love, beyond the loving all;
The mind so plays, so loves to play,
plays with that greater play
of love, that plays with mind and time;
time plays with love, times out of mind,
but loveâ€™s the heart of it;
love loves beyond time, love loves beyond mind,
for in the end,
there is no end to it.
