I got to be hung on a rack
The day is not done till I buy a six-pack
I drink it down boldly
My aunt she just told me
We're stuck in Hackensack
I took the blame and the rap
To keep my friend from losin' his cap
I will hang with the Latin
I'm banned from Manhattan
I'm still wearin' silk and satin
Try to pull the real bluff
Tongue in my cheek and so tough
Keep myself uncanny
Someday I'm comin' back from outta Hackensack
You gave me a smile and a wink
I'm puttin' it down with my feathers and ink
I don't have to worry
I'm not in a hurry
I'll get up and move my fanny.
