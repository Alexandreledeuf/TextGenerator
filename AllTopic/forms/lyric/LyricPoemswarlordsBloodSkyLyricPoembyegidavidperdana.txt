(egi/sulaiman)
Political passion tends to change the skies into an ocean
Robbed of all God’s destiny
Release rats of illusion
How much more lies need to be poured?
Heart beats were defeated in war
Confusion beckoned
Fighting merely for survival
Living far from the truth…
Peace lying weak amid all compactness'
He’s struggling for his lives
Stabbed off ridiculous thrust
Painting of blasphemy pictures
Wrapped with politeness and sweetness
He said “we’re comrades, but the lost comrades”
Complementing on each other
With poison kept in hands
Ego fed by the Master
Who was later clowned by the servants
When would this be end?
How many more lives to be served
On dinner plates...
Lives that pierce and penetrate the hearts
Curses being thrown to you
Harvester of war seeds
You grow them and run…
The pleasure you had gained out of others' tears
Burning the rocks of the Sun
To feel your adopted wolves that you've had freed
Are chewing you…
A slow death
Did you realized what you have done?
Don’t you have a heart any more?
I felt so upset
For the Prince of truth,
Who could be lying dead
On eternity plateau?
Black crows flying low above stinky corpses
Poured into wax mould
The drippings emit foul smells
The heat could have grinded the crying
But I still see you’re hiding behind the moon
Laughing out loud at your victims,
Who’re starting to freeze?
Drinking up infant’s sweats from the Sun’s shadows
Fulfilling your wild urge
How many more would you sacrifice?
Using friends as your shield
From million of bullet
That comes your way
And the rains raining blood
Flooding your damned soul
Their bloods that you've poured into the mould
Open your eyes oh warlords!
The bloods you squeezed would submerge,
Your pride
And be thrown into the Black hole
Staying for long in Hell
Baptizing you…
Could you repay all the sins?
Your sins are larger than the flames of Hell!
How would you going to pay?
