Boat
Of a
Fisherman's
Tossed by waves
Upsurging, he can't stand any longer.
(2 & 3)
Pull
The sails
Down cried he
But found none - The
Sea's rankled by soaring waves, chilled his spine.
With a bait, to cast fishing net, he went
To sea but what
If his boat's
Caught by
Waves!

"Life or death's same to the man or fish" saw
The LIGHT at his
death that's how
Nature
works!
(Rattrap or ratrace philosophy is at work)
