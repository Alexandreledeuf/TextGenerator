Hmm
Humming
Birds hum strum-
Pum, Tg-a-ling,
Tonged a taco bell in the moon's twilight!
Oh dark stars! Rolled, strolled and told 'I'm your DEATH
God Yama! Fly,
lie on stars
Die on
Earth!
No
Morning
In black clothes!
Blowing of wild
Wind, Baying of
Wolves, loud yells aren't needed, just be gentle!
