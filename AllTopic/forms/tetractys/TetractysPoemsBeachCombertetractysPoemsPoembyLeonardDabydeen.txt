(i)
Set
my feet
on beach sand
feel the wetness
I watch the Atlantic in tidal waves.
(ii)
Shrimp
catcher
casting net
with coming tide
I feel the seined salted sea in my bones.
(iii)
Drink
water
coconut
under the tree
I quench my thirst from the heating sunrise.
(iv)
Watch
the crabs
creeping out
from sandy holes
I open my satchel to collect them.
