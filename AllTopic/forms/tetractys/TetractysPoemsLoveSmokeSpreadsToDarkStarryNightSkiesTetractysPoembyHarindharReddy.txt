A
Painting
Flled up with
Cheery colours
And weary shades
In never ending drama is your LOVE!
(2 & 3)
A
Loving
Heart's a space
That fills bliss,
Kills bitterness,
and it lits lamps spark lights eternally!
Versus a bleeding heart tore with sharp blades,
born With hi or
Joy, ends by
Death or
Bye!
4)(Inverted Tetractys)
It's smoke spreads to dark starry night skies - A
Black hole of
Mystery
In the
Heart!
