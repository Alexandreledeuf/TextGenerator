Lol!
In a
Surgical
Strike, some stygian
Missiles were thrown in the love war on me!
Killed
My dreams,
Smashed my hopes,
Crushed my spirit,
In my life seasons pass without reasons!
Tears flowed into a stream, my soul flew up
To the stars, while
I fell in
To the
Dell!
Darn
A scorn!
I warn you,
I Fell on the
Ground going round on a giantwheel named LOVE!
