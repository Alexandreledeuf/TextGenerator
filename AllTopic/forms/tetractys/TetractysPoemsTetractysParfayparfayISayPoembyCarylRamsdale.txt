FEEL
Heavy,
Swish skipping,
Anxious, forceful,
Blood rushing heartbeats, when I look into
EYES,
Tearful
Sickening
Disappointment
Det onating sadness in drops and pools
ON
Bedding,
Cotton white
Stretched to fit tight
Corner folded by skilled bed making hands
ME,
I bow;
Petition
The Almighty
To change the outcomeâ€”to heal you.  Amen!
