Seeds
Are sown
Plants are grown
Bloomed foxgloves: pink,
Blue, yellow, purple said hello at dawn!
How I die to see their smiling faces
In lovely hues
Of violet
Red and
white!
The
Beauty
Of bluebells,
Honeysuckles
Delight hearts, enchant souls with lovely sight.
With a promise, passions flame, ignites hope
and love leads to
Serene and
Blissful
Mind!
