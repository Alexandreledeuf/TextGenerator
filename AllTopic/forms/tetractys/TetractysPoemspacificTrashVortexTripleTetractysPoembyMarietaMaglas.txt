The rules for writing a tetractys are as follows:
Line 1 is one syllable syllable
Segment of speech usually consisting of a vowel with or without accompanying
consonant sounds (e.g., a, I, out, too, cap, snap, check) . A syllabic consonant,
like the final n sound in button and widen, also constitutes a syllable.
line 2 is two syllables; line 3 is three syllables; line 4 is four syllables;
and line 5, is ten syllables.
The fourth and fifth lines may rhyme or rime, the most prominent of the
literary artifices used in versification. Although it was used in ancient East
Asian poetry, rhyme was practically unknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans.
But this is not mandatory.
Waste
Sea green
Wavering
In slimy traps
In woozy circles
Gushing at the deep water horizon
Melody still rooting in bluesy rock
Gloppy red icing
Crooked letters
Violet
Colored
Dream
Fish
Yellow
Flimsy boats
Lanky white man
Muzzy from the work
Cloudy indigo sky hanging round all.
