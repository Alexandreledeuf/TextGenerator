A triangle on stilts
Two blank tombstones lying on their sides
An ear that cannot hear
A toothless sideways grin
A pitchfork with no handle
A toothbrush with only two bristles standing on its end
A bent horseshoe about to pour its luck out
A ladder with a single rung
That, HELLO, now has fallen over
A hook hanging from the ceiling
A butterfly resting on a cliff face
That spot where the floor meets the wall
A bottomless book
An ironed lightning bolt
A hoop to jump through
A loophole set up high so no one can squeeze through it.
An old-fashioned game
Someone=s placed a ramp up to the loophole
Concave piled on convex
Subtract a lofty minus from a plus
A valley with steep walls
That suddenly open to let you out
Thankfully you escape the glacier that comes through
St. Andrew=s cross
A martini glass
A partially folded tri-mat
