Aye I call you a pig and hog! Don’t worry same
Blood flows in me – Inhumane, my name I
Change and mood each time anew – A-bomb
Dingbat, bouncing-betty, Gelignite, ragsorter’s
Explosive, c4 plastic as I’m so materialistic;
Food I eat with automatic hand, just a stick
Geez! Some proteins and Vitamins inward
Hey! I push but result is a fat round belly outward
ira! All are trained idiots & cultured apes, is not a
Jeering tag as we forget all in the world is transient;
KO, my life is gone hither and thither, in water a
Literary splitter-splatter, and die in living.
