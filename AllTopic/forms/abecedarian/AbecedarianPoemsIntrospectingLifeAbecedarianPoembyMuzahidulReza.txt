Introspecting Life - Abecedarian
December 4, 2017
A bird in heart usually sings for the whole lifetime
Being cheered by the secret soul does fly,
Ceremonies go on time to time
Developing or getting demotion the soul's cry,
Every season offers much charm and time
Forever for utilizing the chances properly and to apply,
Goes on singing short or long
Hour after hour the moments remind sillily;
Important parts should be kept in vital time
Judging self deeds, songs rhythmically,
Keeping equilibrium as ages pass from life
Life is not a whim or for one not many,
Miles after miles only its dimension
No way to escape, anyway;
Often harm can come from wrong direction
Protecting that to paradise one may find out the way;
Queer is in every step to dissuade from beguiling
Rarely occult happens think many,
Singing goes on in bird's life standing, sitting or lying
Time to time rhythms change automatically;
Universal points are moving on line
Victory or defeasance will come finally,
Where none will have any question or objection
Xanadu is only dreamy and imaginary,
Yachtsman practically cannot go there sailing
Zigzag ways lead them there indirectly or directly.
