Last night I dreamed hard;
A man shaped wind walked past me
Changed his mind, returned
Feel his mind wonder
Haven't I seen you before?
I sleep-laugh-out-loud..!
The noise wakes me up
Night clock reads three thirty three
I fall back to sleep
Head first tumble up
A leaf wafted from my tree
Caught on a stray breeze
Fellow dreamers cast
Unsettled slumbering sighs
Nocturnal vision
I was being watched
Plucked from our common dream-scape
Alone yet followed
something spooked the  cats
Haikudo forgets purring
Meta leaps from bed
Her collar tinkles
aweigh down moonlit staircase
quiet dreams return
Childhood home kitchen
everything in proper place
daily chores finished
-+-+-
Afternoon cartoons
Back following messages
Cereal box dance
Delicious breakfast
Energy for playground games
Faster than the rest
Grownups in the house
Haunt responsibilities
I watch dream T V
Jet powered action
Kids save their town from monsters
Lunatics and thugs
Mountains streak below
New character friend or foe
Only time will tell
Preview of  next show
Queen of dream sends champion
Racing with Jet Kids
Saving the future
Tune in tom arrow and see
Ultimate showdown
Victory assured
Waving heroes, credits roll
X factor revealed
Youthful television dream
Zooms away, I'm still asleep

Almost awake view
Banished from reality
Creature made of mind
Dream-scape citizen
Everado Man-Shaped-Wind
Face another day
Grasp February
Handle your business in the
Indigo yonder
