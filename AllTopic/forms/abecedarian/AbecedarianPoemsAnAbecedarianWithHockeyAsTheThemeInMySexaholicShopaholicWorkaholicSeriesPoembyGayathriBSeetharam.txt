As per a request, I choose hockey, Canada's game as the theme
And begin by saying that 1994, our first year in Canada, the Toronto Maple Leafs were big
Although Auston Matthews was not even born then
As my own 19 year old son (turns 20 in another 5 weeks)was not a part of our world
Aptitude for a certain play, Art of the game, Aspirations for a career oriented life figured on my list of wishes;
Beautiful was I with my, many a time,
Brazen bold seduction of my husband
Breasts I had as a natural asset and in retrospect, I think
Ballsy was I despite the shyness I had
Becquerels of radioactivity did the two of us emit, Batting of eyelids could I be accused of, Best was I at homemaking and study;
C Programming and math was the name of the game in Spring 1994
Canada it was from then on for we had moved from Phoenix, USA
Cuddling after with a cigarette smoke, dearest, you got a biscuit in the basket to satisfy the Sexaholic in me
Could it be even fathomed that your playing above the Red Line sometimes-days were over
Condom happy, I never let you be a winger
Could it be otherwise possible at the net end for it was a sniper for you at all times
Call it the perks of homemaking, we played for the same team
Characterwise - you were the Pepper Pot who lingered in the rink, Conductwise - you did not need a Jock for I was gentle and loving in my sucking of your manhood, Caresseswise - you had me at the first suck of my tongue or my breasts for I, as the momma hide the cookies in the top shelf;
Do I make the rounds today as the Shopaholic
Dollars I must spend, for a few more would not make a big hole in my purse
Daywise, it would be simply beautiful to go to the Hockey Hall of Fame gift store
Delightful was our visit to the main museum some years ago
Dillydally will I when I make a purchase for myself, Dashing will my son look in a CANADA jersey
DaddyO has the edge when it comes for a family outing;
Effective was my painting of Auston Matthews getting the puck in as a Workaholic
Educated should I become in the details of the hockey world
"Evermore Nevermore"
Escher could not boast of as fine a theme in a painting
Elitist would I be if I were erudite in the ways of hockey or even the NHL, Effortless it seems despite the sweat dripping from their faces, Esther Williams effect would I have on the entire world if I were to enter the hockey arena in a swimsuit;
LUCKY am I as the Sexaholic Shopaholic Workaholic
Loving and Loved
Understanding and Understood
Cultured and Cute
Knowledgeable and Keen
Yesteryears-wise, mostly happy AND Yours Truly, my dear husband and beloved son, in the years to come.
