Beautiful is your saying
When you say words of love and hope,
Beautiful is your behaving
When you behave well with all with love,
Beautiful is your doing
When you do well for all and all believe;
Beautiful is nature and in nature
Beautiful is flower
Beautiful is color
Beautiful is creature;
Beautiful is black
Beautiful is hard
Beautiful is all God made
Beautiful is Himself God.
