Time is eternal
Time is universal,
Creations are on time
Universe is on time
Creatures are on time
Lives are on time,
Things happen in time
Things end in time,
Somewhere time is short
Somewhere time is long
Somewhere time is out
Somewhere time is in start;
Time only goes
Time never stops,
No creation can reach pre-time
Creations only pass time;
In time destroyed much
In time formed much.
