Star, star, star so bright
Star, star of heavenly light
Star so high up in the sky
Showed the way to go that night
Camel, camels, camels, they rode
Camels, camels, I've been told
Camels carrying wise men
Wise men with a heavy load
Gold, gold, gold, they took
Gold, gold, and frankincense
Gold, frankincense, and myrrh
Gifts for their new prince
Light, light, light so bright
Light, light, what a heavenly sight
Light that shined down below
On the manger where he lay that night
Wrapped, wrapped, wrapped he was
Wrapped, wrapped in swaddling clothes
Wrapped so the wise men would know
He was the one God chose
Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah was one
Isaiah, Isaiah, and Daniel of old
Isaiah, Daniel, and Jeremiah
Three prophets that foretold
Child, child, child so fair
Child, child with the red hair
Child under Heavenly Father's care
Savior of the world and His heir
