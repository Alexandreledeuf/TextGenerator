Learning everyday is good for you

Learning is just a beautiful thing
Learning makes your heart and soul sing
Learning is something you should do everyday
Learning is something you're never too old to do
Learning helps meets better all the needs of your life
Learning can help you deal a lot better with all your strife
Learning from mistakes, and your past is a smart thing to do
Learning to respect yourself and others is also too
Learning should never for you ever stop
Learning can strenghten you and motivate you more to get to the top
Learning to see the difference from good and wrong is a must for you to
Learning when to go with the flow or not and deciding what's right is too
Learning can improve all the areas in your life so
Learning is one of the few ways you can grow
Learning all you can learn from everything you care is so cool
Learning is a long process that never ends because life is a school
Learning is a process and a wonderful gift from God himself
Learning what you can from life, experiences, books, etc is important for yourself
Learning to take nothing for granted is very important
Learning to love, have hope and faith you can have them to if you want
Learning the word of God can make you very wise
Learning of His divine Love and Salvation is so nice
Learning that He loves us very much is so awesome
Learning what I've learned have helped me to write for you this poem!
