The great poets are who spontaneously write their time
Their nature, environs, climate they live in;
Their lifestyles, feelings, manners, behaviors
To themselves, to servants and to all others;
Their ill-well, devil-angelic, human powers
Their superstitions, renovations, reformations
Their responsibilities, demands and sacrifice
Achievements, contributions, cooperations, failures;
Their earning, spending, sharing, donating
Their education, thinking, technique, technology
Their worldly, ethical, morality; philosophy, spirituality
Their relations, connections among one another;
Their family-norm, friends and neighbors
Their culture, society, universe, world and country
Their liking, disliking and collecting everything
From ancestors and on reaching future generations.
