Innocent few years after birth
Then men and women
In the earth comes human
At easy or complex tasks in moment
Sinless or sinful actions they attempt,
To pass the angelic, blessed life in the world
To pass the satanic, cursed life in the world
To pass the grandly, logical life in the world
To pass the pompous, luxurious life in the world
To pass the miseries infested life in the world,
To pass the angry, envious, greedy life in the world
To pass the lustful, gayous, bestial life in the world
To pass the furious, murderous, mean life in the world
Most of them are out and out indifferent to right and wrong
That turns the suitable earth into a spot of eternal troubles.
