In The Earth Everyone Is Shepherd
(Anaphora)
16 December, 2018
In the earth everyone is shepherd
Both to help and to be helped,
To get tended self herd
To tend other's herd,
To obey the senior
To command the junior,
To tend self family
To tend self psyche,
To tend physical need
To tend mental need,
To tend instinct
To tend sonic,
To tend overall need
To tend overall feed,
To tend self ability
To tend self inability,
Firstly to come getting birth
Finally to leave meeting death,
At mid well or ill all self deeds
One must bear its fruits.
