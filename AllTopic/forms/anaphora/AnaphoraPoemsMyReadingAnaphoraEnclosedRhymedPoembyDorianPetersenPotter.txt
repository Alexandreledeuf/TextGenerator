I read books because just very much like it
I read them everyday when I can night or day
I read and read them more as mood sees fit
I read only books that pleases soul and eye
I read all kind of books so I can grow
I read books that inspires and spirit heal
I read poetry that like a song in heart flow
I read of art poetry fiction and much more
I read and try to get as many books I can
I read and wish have more time to read so
I read and keep books for research and scan
I read and makes me happy thats all I know
I read many books that just can never forget
I read many that just speak to soul and heart
I read tons of them and many havent got yet
I read keep forever from them can never part
