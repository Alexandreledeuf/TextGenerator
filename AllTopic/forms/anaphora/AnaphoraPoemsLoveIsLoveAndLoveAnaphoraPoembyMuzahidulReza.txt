I do love You by any means
I do love You by any exchange,
I do love You firstly
I do love You lastly;
My every dot wants to face You
My every dot wants to touch You,
My every dot wants to embrace You
My every dot wants to unite with You;
My every dot does love You
My every dot does look for You,
My every dot does want for You
My every dot does desire for You,
My every dot does hanker after You
My every dot does crave for You,
My every dot does wish for You
My every dot does long for You,
My every dot does dream for You
My every dot does meditate for You;
I am not in me but with You
My existence is from You,
I love You firmly
I love You blindly
I love You dearly
I love You madly,
I love You perfectly
I love You respectfully
I love You greatly
I love You rhetorically,
I love You unconditionally
I love You absolutely;
You are in my eyes
You are in my brain,
You are in my mind
You are in my heart
You are in my soul
You are in my cell
You are in my mole,
You are in my nucleus
You are in my atom
You are in my molecule,
You are in my every joint
You are in my every point;
I see You here, I see You there
I see You everywhere,
I see You in flower
I find You in nectar,
I see You in light
I see You in dark,
I hear You in every sound
I hear You in every wind;
Love for You has made me crazy
Love for You has made me fancy,
Love for You has made me singer
Love for You has made me philosopher,
Love for You has made me poet
Love for You has made me great,
Love for You has made me talent
Love for You has made me important;
Your every command I do respect
Your every command I do follow,
Your every command I do demand
Your every command I do perform,
My love has completely sensed You
For life I do love You, I do love You.
