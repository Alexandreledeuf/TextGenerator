The Owner of the entire known and unknown universe
The Owner of each point and cell of all creations, creatures
The Owner of all the beings seen, unseen, small and large
The Owner of all the unseen souls here and there;
The Owner of all the things everywhere small and large
The Owner of all the molecules in the compound elements
The Owner of all the atoms in the fundamental elements
With electrons, protons, neutrons and all other particles;
The Owner of all the seen existences everywhere
The Owner of all the unseen existences everywhere
Is only One, and One; and His sharer is no even a single one
And like Him nowhere in the universe one will find anyone;
All the creatures and the creations will die and decay
He will be ever alive forever as He was and is today;
This belief in Him can save human from wrongs they doing
This belief in Him can defend them from chaos they committing;
I find this great truth in each experiment I doing
I find this great truth in each human being functioning
I find this great truth in each element, each point and joint
In the vast space in each star, planet, moon and object;
All the things and the beings are set at a certain motion
In each galaxy, sphere they are continuously moving, acting,
Reacting, ending, origining and thus the courses completing
Each task in each moment by the orders He is commanding.
