Anaphora you made me mad with words
You made search for the meaning of your name
In search of a form that does not change
Anaphora you put me to the task
You put me through a paidag√≥gos ways
Until I arrive as one of Apollo's triumphant chanted paeans
Anaphora you left me too soon
You left me to seek out other schemes
To open my eyes to other orders and new dreams
