Diversity - Anaphora
8 December, 2018
One shows so many
Sometimes just baby
Sometimes smart young
Sometimes old pong,
Sometimes quite well
Sometimes fully ill
Sometimes mixed
Sometimes unfit,
Again some are always good
Some are always bad
Some are mixed
Some are nonfit,
How much do you know?
Which way do you go?
How much do you know self?
How much do you know otherselves?
