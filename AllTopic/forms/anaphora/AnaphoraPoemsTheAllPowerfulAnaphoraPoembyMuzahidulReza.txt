The All-powerful!
The All-mighty! !
Hearing sudden! ! !
"Who? " May rise a question
Answers come from "Allah", the greatest name,
The Only Owner of the entire universe
And from some of His other names:
He is The Beneficent Who wills goodness for all His creatures
He is The Merciful Who acts with extreme kindness
He is The Eternal Lord Who is with complete Dominion
He is The Most Sacred Who is Pure from every imperfection
He is The Embodiment of Peace Who is free from every imperfection,
