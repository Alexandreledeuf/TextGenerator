Palinode For The Real Patriot
January 10, 2020
O, real patriot!
How to love country you have showed!
Loving rules, loving people,
Establishing the proper state of love and rule;
Now, here in the name of patriotism
Hyper hypocrisy runs as old maxim,
In the name of loving human and humanity
Run butchery, cheating, corruptions speedily,
How they do deal!
If you saw this, you this would only peril,
O, real patriot!
Among human beings you are the greatest!
This palinode is a so little tribute!
To the comparison you are so great!
All over the world those great follow you
Who wanna stand in the line headed by you.
