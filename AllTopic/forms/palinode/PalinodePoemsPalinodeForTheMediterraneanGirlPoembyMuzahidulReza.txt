Palinode For The Mediterranean Girl
January 10, 2020
O, Mediterranean Girl! How much time has gone?
Your sky is again covered with thick black clouds,
You can never see the sun
Gloominess, darkness ever frighten you; and
Around you all the devils are walking, running
Shallowing up things and beings
As the cruel beat animals mercilessly first
Then voraciously and horribly eat,
I know water in your oceans has been getting bloody
For century after century,
I know your oppressed atmosphere
For centuries has been shedding tears,
I am not gonna irritate you again
I am not gonna add to you more pain;
I am just gonna share the world pains you
Through a palinode as the old and real friends do.
