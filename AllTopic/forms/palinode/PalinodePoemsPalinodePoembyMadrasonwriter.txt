I recall
all the mistakes
I have made
which broke
the silver-blades
in shades
of Justice
i for once want
to do what just is
I trust this
will rejoice
all those whom
i have wronged
thronged unseen
in between
a twinkle
shadowed screen
the lines and me
the words that
just mine eyes
could see
within these false
notes of progeny
as long as i find
i am not blind
for profanity
some unnoticed words
resounded
within life's
profoundest
melody.
