Something came between you and me
And I had to sail far from the lee
Toward a high and mad seaâ€¦
I saw you turning back
Waving to another man
Holding hands
And strolling on the sand.
I was reaching for the ocean floor
Of you soul
While all you could do
Is to go
To the backyard
Picking roses
Even though
I tried hard
To see through your clothes
If there's more than flesh
That's to be relished
And then at dawn
Is to be thrown
As a leftover dish.
And I didn't want to believe
That that's all
But only you built a wall
I believe
A round your soul
Barring a thief
Like me
To take his dole.
