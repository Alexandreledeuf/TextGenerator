Walls of words
Are her fading thoughts.
She's alone
As a bird
Singing in her narrow cage.
All she needs is love.
Her secrets
Spot her memories.
She still lives
In her house.
Her time smashed into pieces.
She's expendable
In her flesh.
For the street beggars,
Pawnbrokers
Are precious.
Now, they note her golden cage.
Her thoughts escaped them.
