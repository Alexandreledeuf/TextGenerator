Quiet seas
swathed in moon's full light
are a tease
with no breeze
Urging motion to delight
Man, with no unease.
Strong winds blow
Force into the sea
then you know
that the show
of tranquility must be
power in escrow.
Angry storms
singly, or  much worse
even, swarms
now reforms
fraudulent calm to the curse
of wrath outside norms.
Water's hell
Can destroy all works
and dispel
peace, foretell
doom for any when gone berserk.
Waves prayer cannot quell.
