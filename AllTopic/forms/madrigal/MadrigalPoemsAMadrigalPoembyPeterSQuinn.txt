Every love is age
In their live together
With its thought and weigh
Making pleasance better
So much of in care
Bringing summer in
Letting love be there
In its passion’s spin
Adour is at times stripped
So much full of nothing
In its thinking whipped
With it much of bluffing
Rain may fall and dry
Giving some of aching
Make it not worth try
In its provoke waking
We are here to bring
What we can then tame
In stronger love’s grounding
And its brighter flame
