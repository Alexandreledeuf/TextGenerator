Hints of love as imparted by your touch,
Excited me to wistful sweet extremes,
Implanting deeply these things  in my dreams;
In fantasy things had always been such,
When very real everything then seems,
Like hints of love imparted by your touch,
Exciting me to wistful sweet extremes;
Yet omens and stars augur not so much
For such a love, no doting god esteems,
Not even by truth, that itself redeems
Hints of love as imparted by your touch,
Exciting me to wistful sweet extremes,
Implanting deeply these things in my dreams.
