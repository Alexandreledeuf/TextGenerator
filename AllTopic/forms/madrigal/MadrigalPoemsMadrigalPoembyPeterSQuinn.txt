Take my love song
And bring its whiles
To a heart that’ll long
In pleasures and smiles
Take my nocturne
And bring it from night
Sorrow that burn
In their lost flight
Every dream that’ll go
To the morning on
From the darkness ago
Of distress liaison
Take my love song
And bring it close
Where feelings belong
Like thorns of rose
