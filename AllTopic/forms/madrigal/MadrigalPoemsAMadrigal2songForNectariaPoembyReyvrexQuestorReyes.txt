O sweet Nectaria, keep a song to sing.
And fill your mind with thoughts that make you sigh,
Your heart, with hopes that sooner rise sky high.
Should August's stormy days, their strong winds bring,
Dark clouds that often hide the sun and sky,
Love finds you once you keep a song to sing,
And fill your mind with thoughts that make you sigh.
When Autumn leaves but one leaf left to cling,
And songbirds search for nests where else to fly,
Think not this moment as a time to cry.
But mark, to always keep a song to sing
And fill your mind with thoughts that make you sigh,
Your heart, with hopes that sooner  rise sky high.
