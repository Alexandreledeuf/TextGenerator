In a small cottage, by a wind-swept shore,
Lives my fair sweetheart, that I left behind,
And though far away, is still on my mind;
And I know my heart could not ask for more,
Than the care and love, I could always find,
In a small cottage, by the wind-swept shore,
There with my sweetheart, that I left behind;
When my thoughts wander, to the times before,
To those memories of which I'm not blind,
I won't ever find a  love of such kind,
As in small cottage, by the wind-swept shore,
With my fair sweetheart, that I left behind,
Which though far away, is still on my mind.
