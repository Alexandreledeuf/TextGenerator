Hair of soap and head of tears
rinse mine eyes of Christmas stars
O bells, the bells sear me
Rinse mine eyes of Christmas fears
Water me hot and redly rare
O fey, the fey stars blear me.
Wash mine hair of splendid fears
water me hot and redly rare
O trumps, the trumpets blear me
Scars heal me up to here
scald me pinkly if you dare
O gay, the gay sleds slay me
Is that flesh
floating on the
surface me who
swims or sinks
fraternally?
I know a strange me
with soap for eyes
and suds to see
Eternally yours,
He.
