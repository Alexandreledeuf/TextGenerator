Today is here, tomorrow might not come,
Let us kiss with lips, blazing hot with fire,
Keep me glowing red, burning with desire;
Surely now will I, to your wiles succumb,
My flesh will, to passion of yours aspire,
Today is here, tomorrow might not come,
Let us kiss with lips, blazing hot with fire;
Or give me Hell, if Heaven is to come,
Or drag me along thorns,  midden or mire,
If I, soon after, would solace acquire,
Today is here, tomorrow might not come,
Let us kiss with lips, blazing hot with fire,
Keep me glowing red, burning with desire.
