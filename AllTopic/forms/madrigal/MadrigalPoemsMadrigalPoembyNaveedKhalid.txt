Should I but suspect thee for chamber's maid?
That her suit to my lawful plea commence,
'Gainst all fair forms her argument to prove,
Of tongue-tied Muse her love of seraph wings,
Still wed to my thought by virtuous pen more great,
More blessed be thy presence but to witness beauty;
And in whose esteemed dart that basest cloud to bear,
Which by e'ery passing minute is born of thee,
For when thy lost memory to another's plight
Be my only woe, bereft of such a sight,
I'll straight forget what the world of thine eye,
Hath done to my glorious days, bereaved of light.
