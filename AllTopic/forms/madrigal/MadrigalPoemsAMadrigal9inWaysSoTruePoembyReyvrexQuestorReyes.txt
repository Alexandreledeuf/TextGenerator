I now pledge a love that's without compare,
In a heart that beats for no one but you
That keeps doing so in ways all so true;
For this soul, its simplicity beware,
How so very pure, all it knows to do
Is to pledge a love that's without compare,
In a heart that beats for no one but you;
And should now by chance, you would choose to care,
And to this passion, with spirit imbue,
All to cheer this fool that declares anew,
And pledges a love that's without compare,
In a heart that beats for no one but you,
That keeps doing so in ways all so true.
