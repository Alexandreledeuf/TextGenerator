Seems just yesterday, when we fought as kids
When came puppy love, and I felt aghast
Waking up to find, sixteen came too fast;
With lashes that curl, and shades on your lids
Oh so different, when I saw you last
Seems just yesterday, when we fought as kids
When came puppy love, and I felt aghast
Goodbye now to dolls, as your lipstick bids
Goodbye lollipops, pigtails of the past
Sultry now you look, coming with a blast
When just yesterday, we have fought as kids
When came puppy love, and I felt aghast
Waking up to find, sixteen came too fast.
