Madrigal
it is six in the morning
I get down and move the car from
the place reserved for vans.
This the best of times cooling before the heat begins
only a few people out walking their dogs enjoying
the peace of a beginning.
I could have parked my car in the space between
two cars, but I lose my nerves, this after 60 years of driving.
in the night the wind blew hard from the sea
tiring itself out, and me too I hate the wind it takes my breath away
leaves me a husk falling asleep in front of the TV.
Yesterday I carried water to the house, the porter usually
do this but my wife thinks he takes too much money.
Being able to carry bottles of water is better than not being
able to carry water, my heart does not agree.
