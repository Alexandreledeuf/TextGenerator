Blue jeans and bangles,
Mr. Bo Jangles
Black shirt and pendant,
A rebel unrepentant…..
Dyed hair and wrist bands,
Henna in your hands……..
But I am not blind,
I see you in my mind………
A confusion in rhapsody
A contradiction in harmony
Changing colors, off-key hues,
Syncopating off-beat cues…….
I want to see you in tuxedo
Where no crossovers,
Cross the line…..
I want to see you as you were
No make-over, No pretense…
When the fusion ends
And the fugue begins…..
For no matter how they change you
No matter what they say,
Your tuxedo origin will show
And there, your heart will go…..
Back to where it all began
Back when you were just a man….
No fame,
No game,
I love you now
And I will love you more,
Back then,
Back when,
You were just a man
Behind the piano
