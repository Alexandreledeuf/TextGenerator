Moon can wane, stars can dim, and sun can set,
But mark, they always hold on to the sky,
As dreams may fade, but hopes can never die;
Love sometimes change, hearts also may forget,
For dreams are hard to hold, though hard you try,
Your moon could wane, stars dim, and sun could set,
So best, to always hold on to the sky;
And look upwards, with no pain or regret,
But do not try to find the reasons why,
For life proceeds, by ways none can deny,
Moon can wane, stars can dim, and sun can set,
So mark, to always hold on to the sky,
As dreams may fade, but hopes can never die.
