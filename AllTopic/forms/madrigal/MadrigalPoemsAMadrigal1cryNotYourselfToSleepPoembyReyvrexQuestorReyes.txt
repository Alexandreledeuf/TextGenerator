Nectaria, sweet, cry not yourself to sleep
I came to sing for you this lullaby
Oft sang by angels, wherever they fly
No cause is there for you to ever weep
I said goodnight, but never once goodbye
Nectaria, sweet, cry not yourself to sleep
I came to sing for you this lullaby
Your cheeks I kissed while you have slept so deep
Your dreams have risen higher than the sky
And when you wake up, I will tell you why
Why you need never cry yourself to sleep
For I will sing for you this lullaby
Oft sang by angels wherever they fly
