Unlock the heavy bolts of the prison doors
Free this beauty who was violent only one time
A crime of passion it was
that went too far in the throes of self-preservation
Free her to carry her atonement outside prison walls
Free her to educate us in the ways of frightened, victimized women
Free her to share her wisdom from years of traumas and trials
Free her to expand her artwork
Those colors and expressions
she brings to perfection
in her drawings and portraits
An artist she is and was from birth
Free her
Unlock the heavy bolts of the prison doors
Free her to seize a bright NEW DAY!
