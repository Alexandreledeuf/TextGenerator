Sleep's the Great Healer—
Sleep's the Revealer
Of hidden meanings,
Unbidden gleanings.
When sorrow aches us,
Sleep overtakes us—
Stealing away grief,
Like a welcome thief.
Night is the coverlet
For a longing lover— yet
It's Sleep who delves
Deep into our selves,
Finding dusty dreams... on shadowy shelves.
When life's a jailor,
Sleep's the unveiler
Of an inner key...
To set us free.
Sleep's our best friend
At a hard day's end—
Weaver of fantasy... with reality,
Make-believer of what could be...
Sleep's the Great Healer... of you and me.
