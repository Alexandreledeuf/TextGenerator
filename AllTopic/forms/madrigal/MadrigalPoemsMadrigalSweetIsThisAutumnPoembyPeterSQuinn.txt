Sweet is this autumn coming in
With its wheels of shadings twin
Everything for inside heart
Bleaching time to start
My dreams now up to fill
With its colors and leaves to spill
Love is here to give its calls
Sweetness comes from dripping falls
Keep my moods in constant stray
Every glowing stillness day
Oh my yearnings in autumn's weal
Thoughts of moments from me steal
(Inspiration: John Wilbye, Madrigal: Love Not Me for Comely Grace
Love not me for comely grace,
For my pleasing eye or face;
Nor for any outward part,
No, nor for my constant heart:
For those may fail or turn to ill,
So thou and I shall sever.
Keep therefore a true woman's eye,
And love me still, but know not why;
So hast thou the same reason still
To doat upon me ever.)
