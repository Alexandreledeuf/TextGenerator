walking in a cave
defter than before
a hard rocky breast
covererd in stoles
the wind passing through the walls
singing a song
so richlier
making you want to spin
in the dizzy cold air
that stole twirling everywhere
the amazing madrigal
repeating its name
an amazing madrigal
repeating the same
