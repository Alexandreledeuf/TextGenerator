When in her face mine eyes I fixe,
A fearefull boldnesse takes my mind,
Sweet hony loue with gall doth mixe,
And is vnkindly kind:
It seemes to breed,
And is indeed
A speciall pleasure to be pin'd.
No danger then I dread:
For though I went a thousand times to Stix,
I know she can reuiue me with her eye;
As many lookes, as many liues to me:
And yet had I a thousand harts,
As many lookes as many darts,
Might make them all to die.
