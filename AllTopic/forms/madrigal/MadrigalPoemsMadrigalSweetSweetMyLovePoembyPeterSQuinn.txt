Sweet sweet my love
Come close now
And give my heart one more try
Each cloud above
Its lowbrow
Shall else fill my sorrow's sky
Sweet sweet my true
You still are
Like the summer sky in glow
Its azure blue
Afar star
That only true lover know
Sweet sweet the one
Never lost
You bring my passions high
Till love is done
Away tossed
When the years will say goodbye
(Inspiration: John Wilbye, Madrigal: Adieu, Sweet Amaryllis:
Adieu, adieu
Sweet amaryllis.
For since to part your will is.
O heavy tiding
Here is for me no biding.
Yet once again
Ere that I part with you.
Amaryllis, amaryllis,
Sweet Adieu.
