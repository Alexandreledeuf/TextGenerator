You gave to me those roses, red, to keep
To plant and care, to make them last for days
And yet when gone, the joy in my heart stays
Then, for a while,all sadness could not creep
The lovely thoughtthat still my mind portrays
You gave to me those roses, red, tokeep
To plant and care, to make them last fordays
A rose could bloom with due praises to reap
And rouse my mirth with charm that it displays
Arraignedbeautifully, to start some ways
When you gave me those roses, red, tokeep
To plant and care to make them last fordays
That though when gone, the joy in my heart stays.
