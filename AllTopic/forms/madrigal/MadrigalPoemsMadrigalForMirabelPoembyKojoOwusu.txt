Never again would I relegate the pearl found in the black conclave
To the dark depths of the abysm of time
Never again would I rant and rave hurling infernal profanities
At the dispenser of my delusion
Long lost in the hurly-burly of illusion
Tossing and turning whirling in labyrinths of doubts
Irreligion and arrant agnosticism was surging in my veins
I desecrated your altar of love reducing the gods of passion to mere playthings
On the unloved waves of life I billowed until your queenly fleet appeared
And that night of nights you became the stiller of the demented storm in my life
It was a miracle meeting you Mirabel
I will walk to the altar of love in triumph to be shielded in the benignity
Of your incomparable generosity
Your beauty a cloak for my demented filth
O it is a miracle meeting you Mirabel
