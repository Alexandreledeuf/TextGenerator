Dear maiden, Angel full of grace
Rays of sun sing before your face.
Your beauty is written
With incredible perfection,
By the angels of heaven
With true inspiration.
Gracious princess carved
By gods of creation,
You're a poem created
By the hands of illumination.
Your voice is a sweet symphony,
Your body is a sculpture.
Your skin is the honey of destiny,
Dear comely creature.
