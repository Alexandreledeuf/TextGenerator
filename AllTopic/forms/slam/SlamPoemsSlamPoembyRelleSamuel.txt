As I sit and cry
Hear voices yelling
I hear screaming
The door slam
It`s quiet to silent
Like the world stopped
I hear my tears drop
Why do I go through this?
Did they hear my tears drop?
Did they hear the door slam?
I wish they would just stop
And listen to me
Here I am sitting hear
Crying with pain
Can anyone make them stop?
I can`t take it anymore please just stop
Youâ€™re tearing me apart
As I sit and cry I hear vices yelling
And the door slam
