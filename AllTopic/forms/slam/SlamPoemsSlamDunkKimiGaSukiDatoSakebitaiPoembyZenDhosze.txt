Original / Romaji Lyrics	English Translation
mabushii hizashi wo se ni
hashiridasu machi no naka
tatakareta   itsumo no you ni   kata wo
kimi ni muchuu na koto ni
wake nante nai no ni  [1]
sono ude wa   karamu koto wa nai [2]
Starting my run in the middle of town,
bright sunlight at my back,
as always, [you] tapped my shoulder
I'm so enthralled by you
- yet for reasons unknown [1]
your arm won't be linked to mine. [2]
itsu no ma ni ka   hitomi
ubawarete hajimatta
hanasanai    yuru ga nai [3]
Crazy for you
Before I realized it,
you stole my gaze, and it began.
I won't let you go.  I won't have any doubts.
Crazy for you. [3]
kimi ga suki da to sakebitai
ashita wo kaete miyou
kooritsuite'ku toki wo    buchikowashitai
kimi ga suki da to sakebitai
yuuki de fumidasou
kono atsui   omoi wo   uketomete hoshii
I want to shout 'I love you.'
Let's try to change tomorrow.
I want to smash this freezing (moment in)   time.
I want to shout 'I love you.'
Let's be brave and take a step forward.
I want you to receive these warm emotions.
zawameita FUROA ni
nigiwau TE-BURU goshi
nanigenai    kimi no shisen ni   yoishire
koi wo shite-iru you de
odoraserete'ru yo na
takanaru kodou ni   mou uso wa tsukenai
On the noisy floor,
across from me at the crowded table,
I'm lost in your casual glance.
It feels like I'm in love with you,
yet it's like I'm being toyed with.
I can't lie to my soaring hearbeat (emotions)   anymore.
itsu ni nareba   kawaru
kono modokashii   yuujou
todoketai   tashikametai
I take you away
When will it change,
this frustrating friendship?
I want to tell you.   I want to make sure.
I take you away.
kimi ga suki da to sakebitai
nanimokamo nugisute
kokoro tokasu kotoba wo   mitsuke dashitai
kimi ga suki da to sakebitai
kon'ya wa kaesanai [4]
mitsumeru dake no   hibi nante   owari ni shiyou
I wanna cry for you
I want to shout 'I love you.'
Let's leave everything behind.
I want to find the words to melt your heart.
I want to shout 'I love you.'
I won't let you leave me tonight. [4]
Let's end the days we don't get past just gazing at eachother
I wanna cry for you
[Instrumental]
