Headin' for the top
Wonder when I'll drop
Don't know how to stop
Show now the way
To set free the pain
Let your mind drain,
Find a new lane
With less shame, and don't tame
The natural way to feel
The gradual reeling of the feeling
Of depression and unhappiness
My confession is this;
Were all in control,
Can never lose hold
Whether we be wise or bold
So grasp this with firm fist
And strong mind and realize
That the prize is right in front of your eyes,
Dont compromise, or give into all the lies,
Because the truth is a mold,
One that you hold, made out of
What's told, and can be sold
With nothing more than a genuine smile
