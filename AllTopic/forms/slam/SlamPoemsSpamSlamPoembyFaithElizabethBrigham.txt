who doesn't slam spam
it takes up space
eats up our time
discarding it
it is terribly
a n n o y i n g
i have given up
fighting it
spammers beware
the only part of
your annoying mail
i read is at the end
where there are
countless jumbled phrases
always attempting to make
the best of a bad situation
i pick out a word or two
and write a poem
thanks to you
