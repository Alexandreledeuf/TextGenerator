I’m a sculpture
I sculpture images
That stays for ages
In your heart, mind and soul
That makes decades of years
to be only a couple a seconds
As they stay in your heart, mind and soul
They can’t be vandalized, demolished or even be stole
Images not of him, her or me
But images of you
I carve curved words to be nursed words
I turn cursed words to be blessed word
I rebuild dumped words to be dope words
If you see my footsteps
Sign on them
Applaud
If you can’t wipe them out
I’m a poet
A slam poet
If I was a rapper
I’d be killing the beat
But I’m killing the rhythm
Since there’s no drum
I’m demolition the silence
I’m not rapping or slamming
I’m ……. I’m……..
The spit is too tiny
So I’m vomiting these words
And let them run around
Let them scatter on the ground
And let the breeze of free words
Take its cause
Because my soul was crucify
To free these words
And for them to enter kingdom of poetry
If you see my footsteps
Sign on them
Applaud
If you can’t wipe them out
I’m an artist
I adore words
I don’t draw pictures
I draw words
Paint words so bright
That wrong sentences seem right
Even boring sentences seem fun
My aim is for you to learn be aware and understand
That’s my job as a slam poet
If you see my footsteps
Sign on them
Applaud
If you can’t wipe them out
