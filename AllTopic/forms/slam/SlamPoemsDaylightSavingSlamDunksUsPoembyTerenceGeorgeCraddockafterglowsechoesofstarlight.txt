daylight saving slam dunked into falling Autumn
destroyed is natural ebb flow cycles increasing fading
days draw out slowly into warming Spring Summer
days draw in slowly into colder chilling Autumn Winter
natural rhythm accumulative days
lengthening subtracting
body clock biorhythms
made minute changes daily adjusting
Spring starts slowly approaching
then an hour added suddenly Summer
we are thrust full force into long days
long evenings one hour sleep missing...
do not forget
to add an hour going
to bed on a Saturday night
early or late sleeping...
the world turns
turns suddenly Summer
is burned away time
to change time...
Autumn starts slowly shortening
then an hour deducted suddenly Winter
days are dark dark too soon days
suddenly light eclipsed dark too soon
suddenly rooms are night colder
day is dead done
sooner than body clock stunned
biorhythm wants
