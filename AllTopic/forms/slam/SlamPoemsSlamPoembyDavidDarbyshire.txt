To Slam a Door it really does show
How 'Little', Angry people do know,
About the feelings of folks like Us
They just Shout, Slam and Cuss
To Slam a Door it's not the end
But it does drive me around the Bend
Here I sit, all in Tears
Holding my hands over my Ears
To close a Door Soft and Sweet
These people I like to meet
They take care say: 'hallo' and 'goodbye'
Them angry 'f$%^&*ers' need a punch in the 'eye'
