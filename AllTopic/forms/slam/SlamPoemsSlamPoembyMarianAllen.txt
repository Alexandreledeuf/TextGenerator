My heart begins to race as my hands begin to tremble and shake.
Now I have to be careful I cant make one little mistake.
As I tie off one arm,
I tell myself,  This is it,
This is the last time then I quit!
No sooner then I make my hit in the perfect spot,
I feel this wave of heat,
Now my body is so hot..
I feel it,
Its on its way.
Can I describe it?
let me see if I can find the right words to say...
First I feel hit my throat..
Then the tingle in my lips..
I feel this rush from my head to my toes!
I even feel it in my finger tips!
Yes this took my breathe away..
even solved my problems for today.
But you see I don't do this for pleasure,
Its mask my pain.
For Tomorrow I will have to deal with my own damn shame!
