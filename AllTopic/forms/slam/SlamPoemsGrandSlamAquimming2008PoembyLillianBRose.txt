In China, here it stands
Another olympian made his stand
A variety of strokes and turns
With exchanges finely tuned
Leaving with Gold
Not only Once
But seven more times
Carreer best for his generation
Carreer Individuals
and team efforts
Equal to the Legend
That excelled before him
the one that will
Become Legendary
as Mark Spitz
Was proir to this
Just makes you
wonder who will
the next generation
give us, when
their legend is made.
