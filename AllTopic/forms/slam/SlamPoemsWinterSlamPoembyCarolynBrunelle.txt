Got bright and sunny
Went from cool to hot,
Just when Spring was here
Then it was not;
Winter slammed the
Door again. Even now
Another storm’s
Coming in,
Rain and lots of it.
And of course I had
Just washed the car.
Weather just so bizarre.
Shorts and thongs
Didn’t last long
Now I need a sweater
Till the temps get better
Because again it is cold, as
Winter takes another shot.
Really thought Spring had
Arrived, but, I guess not.
