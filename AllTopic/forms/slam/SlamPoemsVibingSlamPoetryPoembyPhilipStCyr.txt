There is no greater harmony
than the vibe that exists between you and me
It's chemistry
Like the birds and the bees
feelings that make one weak in the knees
the type of vibe that makes a bold man shy
a confident man nervous,
and fills one up with butterflies
Putting you and I together
made us the perfect match
Imagining U and I forever
makes two the perfect catch
I need only one chance
to prove I can be better than
any love you've experienced from any other man
you and I may have been two worlds apart
but its infatuation
that led me to your heart
the way you make me feel is real
like a touch of satin with the genuine silk feel
You put the seal...on my part
and I knew it from the start... that there would be no other
that could replace...
the space I have for you in my heart.
