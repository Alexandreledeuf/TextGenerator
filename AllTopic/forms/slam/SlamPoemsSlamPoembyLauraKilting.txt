I have given up hope again
Im on the floor in my bathroom again
Theres a can in my hand again
And I slam it against my thigh again
Again and again I want a bruise
Soon im curled up in a ball again
Nearly an adult yet curled against a radiator terrified again
I regret it again
Promise not to do it again
I tell a lie again
