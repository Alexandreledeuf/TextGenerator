Cursed stanzas, unholy words
A doggerel ate my rhyme
And cast aspersion on my verse
Damned poem, be done
I stab at your fleshy syntax
Give no quarter to any phrase
And stifle this nascent stave
Damned poem, be done
But your form yields, free and lax
Bereft of purpose or point
Its seductive aspect void
Damned poem, is done
