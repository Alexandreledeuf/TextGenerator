Someone once said love is a lonely battle
But I'm not sure this is worth winning
I tell myself I'll never go back again
And the way I feel, only the beginning
Chorus
I'll slam the door on my love again
Letting you down another time
Open it up and let her in
Always crossing that line
I love and leave, and you never see
This deception will be my downfall
I come home late, your always asleep
I couldn't tell her my faults
I'll slam the door on my love again
Letting you down another time
Open it up and let her in
Always crossing that line
I'll slam the door on your love again
Spending my last dime
Giving in to this fatal sin
And crossing the final line
