The Slam
Pestilence
January 3, 2020
Some poisonous pests together
Cutting, destroying forever
The golden leaves
To spread pestilence
Out of their fatal poisons
To commit some vast dead regions,
So I'm gonna check it
I'm gonna test it
I'm gonna cure it
Putting something effective
Putting some protective pesticide
As none wanna again bear it,
So let's slam the old pestilence
The old dreadful pestilence
To raise new leaves
To invite birds, butterflies
To sprout new flowers
To sprout new fruits.
