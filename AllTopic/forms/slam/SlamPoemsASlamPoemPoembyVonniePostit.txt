I go back to 9 months before August 1996
my birthdays in 9 months,
birth date
day to celebrate
celebration
presents.
a present
the presence of a baby girl,
a gift from god,
trick or treat,
we don't know,
I see my mom.
I go back to 9 months before August 1996.
my dad
my brothers,
they're happy.
happiness
ness
neglect, nostalgia.
I go back to 9 months before
August 1996.
don't do it
please, don't close that door
please, don't lock the door
don't be alone
alone with all your love,
love-making but
you're not making love
you'll contract a disease.
a diseased little girl
a sickness
she spreads her sickness
you'll tell her for the first time
she spreads her sickness
she's contagious,
she'll infect them,
don't do it.
step back
come back
cum
look what you've created
she gets coal for Christmas
too much soul within her
she's got gold within her
shoulda called her blackboard
she's chalk full of nevers
never will be
never has been
never good enough.
never smart enough
never skinny enough
skinny, skin bones
her flesh,
her flesh is infection
her flesh is pain
she'll live in a skin
that isn't her own she's
owned by her flesh
pays rent to her flesh
with her tears
he picks up every night
never fit enough.
always too big,
enough.
please set her free,
I go back.
to August 1996.
a little girl is born.
pain is replaced by joy
hospital room too tall
for the earthquake
coming your way.
unnatural disaster,
she's disastrous.
hold her,
mother her
smother her choke her
choke her with mothersome
cumbersome love, love her some.
do you hear me?
hear me.
for my sake.
