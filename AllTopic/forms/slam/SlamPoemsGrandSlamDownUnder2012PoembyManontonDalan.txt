cold dawn in usa
where most still lay
i'm awake to watch
australian final match
maria beautiful stroker
victoria smart n younger
grunts were prevalent
miss there miss here
they both played along
two hours one emerge
champs; i can read lips
'oh! my god what will i do'
maria has great speech
milk your heart away
victoria lovely smile
got her name on trophy
crowd cheers to their might
me too i enjoyed all of that
