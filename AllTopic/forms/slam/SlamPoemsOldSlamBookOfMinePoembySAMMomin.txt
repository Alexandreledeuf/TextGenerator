Old Slam Book of mine
Its glossy cover, covered
Now in slight dust. Age
Yellowing its pages, still
Its smell- nostalgic
Flaunting an array of dear
Memories, and the
Picturesque pictures painting
A panorama
Of those carefree golden days
Old Slam Book of mine
Eloquently expressing
Boasting of dear ones
Who poured thier hearts out, in it
For its very owner
Let me close you dear, fore the
Fighting tears give in
Now closed you lie, still hollow
I feel. Could it be
I just left my heart inside?
