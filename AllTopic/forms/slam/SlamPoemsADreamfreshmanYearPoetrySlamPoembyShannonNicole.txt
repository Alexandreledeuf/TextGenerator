Sleeping in a pile of garbage on the streets.
Only eating the fresh food on the ground.
Searching for change in the corners of curbs.
Sitting under a balcony, so the ran don't hit her feet.
She watches the cars race past her spot.
Ignorant guys throwing cans at her face.
She's only crying in the rain, so no one sees her tears.
She wishes she wasn't so invisibe.
A girl her age steps into her fight,
That girl saved her dumbass.
They became friends and didn't leave without one another.
Until that girl, she slit her throat.
She's guessing her daddy had something to do with it.
She was gonna talk to him today,
But the world just go dizzy.
It wouldn't stop spinning.
Maybe someone drugged her.
She woke up in the middle of the day.
Pain striking her head like a broken bat on the ground.
She let no tears fall.
She smirked in the face of that girl's daddy.
The daddy smacked her until she was down.
She only wiped away the blood that spill out her mouth.
She smiles at him
And the daddy shoots her in the head.
She wakes up sweating.
She's saying it was all just a dream.
'Til she looks around and sees all the worried faces.
She sees the machines, they beep extremely slow.
She watches as the nurse smiles down at her.
She then closes her eyes
