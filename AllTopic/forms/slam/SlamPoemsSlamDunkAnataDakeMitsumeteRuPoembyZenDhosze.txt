Original / Romaji Lyrics	English Translation
anata dake mitsumete'ru
deatta hi kara   ima demo zutto
anata sae soba ni ireba    hoka ni nannimo iranai
yume no high tension
I've got my eyes only on you.
Since the day we met - now and forever -
when you're next to me, I don't need anything else
Dream's high tension
[Instrumental]
[Instrumenta l]
negaigoto   kanatta no
yawaraka na fuyu no hi
utsumuki   hazukashi-sou na special driving date
All of my wishes came true
on a gentle winter day,
on a shy, timid, special driving date.
anata ga sou    yorokobu kara
kesho mo mazu yameta wa
doko ni ite mo   tsukamaru you ni   POKEBERU motta wa
Since it seemed to please you,
I quit using makeup
and carried a pager so you could reach me anywhere.
kuruma mo kuwashikunatta shi
SAKKA- sae mo suki ni natta wa
mayotte-iru kedo
kono hito ni isshou tsuite yukou to kimeta
I got to know about cars
I even got to like soccer
I'm still a little hesitant, but
I'm set on following you for all my life.
anata dake mitsumete'ru
deatta hi kara    ima demo zutto
anata sae soba ni ireba     hoka ni nannimo iranai
ai no high tension
I've got my eyes only on you
Since the day we met - now and forever -
When you're next to me, I don't need anything else
Love's high tension
anata ga sou   nozomu kara
massugu kaeru you ni natta
ZATSU datta   kotobadzukai teinei ni natta
Since you seemed to want me to,
I started heading straight home,
and I straightened out the rough way I used to talk.
anata ga sou   utsumuku kara
nagadenwa mo yameta wa
benri datta   otoko-no-ko-tachi   katazuketa
Since it seemed to bother you,
I stopped talking on the phone for so long,
and got rid of all the easily-available guys
kami mo fuku mo medatanaku
o-ryouri mo GANBARU kara
Party ni wa ikitai na...
iyagatte'ta ano ko to mo zekkou shita wa
My hair and clothes aren't eye-catching
Try my best at cooking, so...
I wish I could go to a party...
I even broke it off with that girl you didn't like.
anata dake mitsumete'ru
mukashi mitai ni warawanaku natta
nigate datta spicy your mama
ima de wa ocha shite'ru
YABAI high tension
I've got my eyes only on you
I don't smile like I used to.
I was so bad at it - spicy your mama
Now here I am just serving you tea
Dangerous High Tension
[Bridge   (Spoken) ]
I love you
It's an entrance to the paradise in the hill
Changing my mind, and my dream,
and keeps on running in my heart
Like you will know how
I'm crazy for you
[Bridge   (Spoken) ]
I love you
It's an entrance to the paradise in the hill
Changing my mind, and my dream,
and keeps on running in my heart
Like you will know how
I'm crazy for you
anata dake mitsumete'ru
soshite hoka ni daremo inaku natta
jimi ni ikite-yuku no
anatagonomi no onna
mezase! ! love power   Wow wow wow!
I've got my eyes only on you
And now there is no one else.
I want to live simply,
and be
your kind of woman! !   Love power   Wow wow wow!
anata dake mitsumete'ru
hitori de matsu   futari dake no heya
anata no hohoemi wa     bara-iro no kusari
yuke! ! yume miru yume nashi onna! !
Oh, wow wow wow!
I've got my eyes only on you
Waiting alone in a room for two
Your smile is like a rose-colored chain
Go on! ! Dreaming woman without dreams! !
Oh, wow wow wow!
