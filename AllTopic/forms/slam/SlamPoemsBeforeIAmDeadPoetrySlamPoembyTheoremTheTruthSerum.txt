I fell from a crater and stepped off
It was burning in the sky like a heaved Molotoff
Crashed onto the earths crust
I tried to move my muscles but it was like moving a hinge with rust
I stood naked looking up to the moon which was full that day
Its eye looked like slow tooth decay
I smelled the burning of the forests
One of my biggest tests
Sent forth to preach love and happiness
This delirium has become my reality
Here to fulfill the written prophecy
Written by the hand of a Nordic man
Written by pictures with swirls of the hand
Many colors depicted the coming of the soldiers of peace
Walking below the moon in a torn white yarn fleece
Thoughts being sent out to the messengers
From the almighty in the heavens to his passengers
That come to save this world of the sun
Oh yes I am one
I am part of the eternal sun
Sent to shine happiness to all
Not to institutionalize us like Paul
But for us to be sent free to do God's work on our own
After all we are materials made of flesh and bone
One day we will disintegrate
And be fed to earth the great
We are meant to become one with it
So why do we try to fight it
We just become nihilistic
Read the statistic
My light shines more than the intercontinental ballistic
Feel this warmth as it transitions into the light
I'm fighting the war we all should fight
The separation of all the races
We will see the Lord early just because of the color of our faces
Religions that institutionalize us to gain more power
They all have our ears so that they can devour
What makes us different between all animals
We have the ability to love but still we are cannibals
Made up of syllables
That define us like solutions on the timetables
Reach in and foster your true ability to shed light
I'm through with shedding tears from fright
Some days we're orange and some days we are red
I want to shed as much light as I can before I'm dead
