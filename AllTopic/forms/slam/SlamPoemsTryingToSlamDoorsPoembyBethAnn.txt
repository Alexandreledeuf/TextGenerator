I slammed the door shut this time
Determined not to let you back in it again
Because of the choices you make
All you had to do was promise
To not make those choices anymore
And I would of easily taken you back
Everytime we get back together or hook up
We pretend everythings alright
I think the only reason
We hook up is because
We're both lonely
I didn't really feel that
Loving feeling this time
Except when he wanted to fool around
Could it be that we both know
That we should of left that door shut
If so it makes me wonder
How long it will stay left open
Before we start forcing it shut
I won't be telling anyone about his last visit
Or that I am still talking to him again
It's my secret because
I have begged my friends and family
To not let me do this again
I can't let them know how weak I am
