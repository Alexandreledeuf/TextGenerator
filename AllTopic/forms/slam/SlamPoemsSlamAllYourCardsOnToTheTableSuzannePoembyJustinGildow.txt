Wine glasses half full
This night seems mystical for some strange
reason
Outside, the light posts have lit up the
night
It's just us tonight
Suzanne
And it's the start of a new season
As Summer is finally gone
So I have to ask
Would you slam all your cards on to the
table, Suzanne
I have my own beliefs, thoughts, and reasons
I'm sure you do as well
Let's talk about politics
Let's talk about accomplishments
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about peace
Let's talk about war
Let's talk about what's going on in the
city
With the way it's looking there
It doesn't look or sound pretty
So slam all your cards on to the
table, Suzanne
On some things, I might agree
On some things, I might disagree
Yet in this time I'm spending with you right
now
It's never a dull moment
That much can be said
