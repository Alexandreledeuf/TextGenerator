For years and years we are told,
‘Take care of your breasts with bold'.
Give them regular monthly tests.
So that  they are kept well at best
So I heeded all these warnings,
And guard them with astute care.
Not once I let them fawning,
They get protected clothed or bare
When I reached ripeful age of 50
‘come and do mammo' one radiologist told me
'I make sure I will handle you personally'
'OK, ' I said, 'I will come and see you immediately'
'Stand up here real close' she then said,
She got my hoot flat on plate,
'And tell me when it hurts, ' she further state,
'Ah yes! Stay quiet now, it's ready to translate'
She stepped upon a pedal,
I could not believe my eyes!
A plastic plate came down with a battle,
My hooters shrunk on this device!
My hoot was stretched and mangled,
From underneath my skin.
My poor boob was being strangled,
To Malaysian Pancake thin.
Excruciating pain I felt,
Within it's viselike grip.
A prisoner in this vicious belt,
My poor defenseless crib!
'Take a deep breath, ' she gently said to me,
Who does she think she's kidding? !
My chest is mashed with no hope of mercy,
Eyes were blurring and head was spinning.
'There, that's good, ' I heard her say,
The room was slowly swaying
'Now, let's have a go at the other bay.'
Oh God… be kind pleeaase, I was praying.
The plates squashed it  up and down,
They squashed it from left to right.
My eyes were wet, in pain I drown,
My pants were soaked,  in sweat of fright
This machine was created by  man,
Of this, I have no doubt.
I'd like to stick his balls in it,
And see how they come out! !
Next time  they make me do this,
I am sure I will not comply
I will say excuses to give it a miss
Hoping on their own, my boobs will dry.
