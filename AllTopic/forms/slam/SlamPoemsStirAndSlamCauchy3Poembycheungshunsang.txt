Stir to slams..
Hackersâ€™ writes are under counts.
Bottom girls will break my lucks.
Slanging buys will sell the hours.
Boxed our times are timers turns.
Slamming china fights our man.
Tanks to null the nukes are masses.
Favor hands have killing plans.
Stirred to slams are 64-tanks.
Stirred the brains are china slams.
Taiwan ranges are full of ranks.
Slam and bang as you are cans.
Shape their powers all are tanks.
