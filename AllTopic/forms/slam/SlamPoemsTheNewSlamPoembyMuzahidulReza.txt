The New Slam
December 28, 2019
After a snooze
The stranger began to sneeze
It made a sudden burst out
Of sharp sound,
Though the sound broke the longer silence of the room
It caused asking him
A lot of questions
Of harsh and fun,
James,
Let's have a game
Base?
Or, chess!
It's evening
Prayer time
Why a game?
Let's do something for means, name and fame.
