With wishes wanted,
To quickly slam dunk.
Getting them to have,
As fast as dreams come.
Without reality to maneuver through.
Disappointing to block,
Each one to stop.
With an obstacle done.
If only dreams came,
To touch and get as seen on TV.
More would be the people,
Less upset with others to perceive...
What they have did not require work.
Or sweat equity invested,
That may take years to receive.
And awaiting with patience,
Few today bombarded to delude...
Dismiss to disbelieve,
Makes most dreams come true.
"How can I get what you have? "
-Work hard at it day and night.
Without thinking of it to come,
Thrown to you.
Or handed over like a ball that is passed.-
"I mean...
For real.
What do I have to do? "
