The smile and tears all woven
along the words inside.
Whenever I read,
I will stuck in the past,
Where our friendship began.
With a grin,
About the holiday
Our first talk started,
With a heavy heart,
We left for holiday.
With a hope we could meet again.
The flapping sound of papers;
The whirling noise of fan;
The fainted voice of Professor
And the lazy hisses
Still sung like a lullaby.
The hours we walked
In drizzle and the chuckle
That lasted for long
Flashed through my eyes
Brings on the tears
That could't stop.
It's all like happened now
And it's all like a dream.
When I open my eyes
I am holding only the note-book
That left with memories.
And the hope is still a hope.
