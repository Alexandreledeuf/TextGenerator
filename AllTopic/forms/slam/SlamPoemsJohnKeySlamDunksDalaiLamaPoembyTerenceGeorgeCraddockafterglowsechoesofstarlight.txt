John Key sly slam dunks
insults beautiful mind Dalai Lama
to gain political clout points
sucking up to power alluring China
to gain credit Tibet oppression points
ignoring Chinese atrocities in Tibet
bit of a hyper double standard
don't you think Johnny boy foxy?
we remember your Key spot
push effort to get
New Zealand on Security
Council while in
New York back in 2013
on shoe string budget
accusing rival candidates
Spain and Turkey
of using aid money
to buy their votes
purchased from small African countries
Key morals said New Zealand would not
be spending its way onto Council Security
apparenty blood votes
purchased from Chinese
atrocities in Tibet
does not count! ! !
what can you expect really
of a forked tongue agnostic
who attends church frequently
to doing the right thing but
'told Wen Jiabao, Premier
of the People's Republic
of China
in April 2009 that
neither he nor any
of his ministers
would meet
the Dalai Lama,
the exiled
Tibetan
spiritual leader.'
poor Johnny
so many skeletons
falling out
of your closet you should
open a factory producing
blood & bone fertilizer?
Johnny's actions
repeat scary heres
Johnny themes?
