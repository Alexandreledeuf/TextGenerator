I could be the perfect man for you
if you opened up your heart and gave love a chance
putting the past behind behind you with a single glance
I'd fill your life with romance
If forever was to be the plan
I could be all races and cultures combined in one man
and give you all the love that you can stand
If you're looking fort a man
who will treat you like a queen
I'd give you a tour of seven continents
and every island in between
although it may seem like a dream
with a far-fetched reality
You should know by now that that's my mentality
with nothing to unravel seeâ€¦
If you open up your heart and keep it real with me
I will be the spirit that sets my soul free.
