Doors that slam and shut real tight
usually happen after the fight.
Behind those doors tears do drop,
taking their time before they stop.
After they've dried and calm's prevailed
you wonder why it is that you failed
to recognize how you let tears creep
into your eyes that made you weep.
Surely this scene you've had before.
Stubborness and pride slammed that door.
The emotions of love get all mixed in.
It's then that your head goes into a spin.
But down deep inside what made you cry
is the ego you own and that is why
you are more than ego. You are all heart.
The door you slammed tore your own heart apart.
