Mean! I mean, man!
Here we go again
On and on in the motion
That intensifies like an ocean
Cut the metaphor, alright!
We should really try to run
Because this crazy situation
It's not even fun
What do I really mean?
Then you got to listen
Or read because this is written not spoken
We sometimes get caught in situation
And it's annoying to get ourselves out
It's not easy and can be annoyingly dumb
Everybody cares only their own butt
I have a nice one
Do you have a nice one?
You got to show it if it's true
Show your butt
But..
But..
You don't want to
Because you think it's crazy
Or silly
Or maybe you've been lying about it
The beautiful butt
But nobody cares
It's just an idea - the back stuffs
Because I'm a bit mad
My situation is bad
Yeah they say it's only in my head
I'm not stupid
Someone I used to work with is..
Or someone I used to work for is..
Foolish
But this motion isn't about their asses
Which I'm sure none of them got pretty ass
Hey, I don't kiss ass
O don't conclude it's my ex-boss
Don't try to accuse
You should know he can sue
Yeah, that's true!
Not Susan â€˜Sue'...
Involving the judge and lawyers kind of sue
And money too
So be careful with your words, beau
I just see it through
So I'll let that get away this time
Keep my mouth shut like I'm mime
For now because I know this game
You want to know what game?
That question is lame!
Now don't try to blame
Nobody likes the blame game
I don't care I won't lose a dime
You too, you're wasting your time
Reading this poetry that also wasted my time
At least it somewhat rhyme...
