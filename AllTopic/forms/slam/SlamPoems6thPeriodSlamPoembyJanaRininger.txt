Sixth period is such a bore
Makes every breathe I take even seem like a chore
While the girl behind me starts to snore,
How I would love to just run out the door.
The teacher says, 'We're learning something new! '
I clasp my face in my hands and say 'Boo Hoo'
This class makes my heart go blue,
I ignore the lesson and try to find something else to do.
This poem wasn't meant to have a reason
Just express my thoughts in this senioritis season
Writing this way isn't treason,
You're not some I have to please, go on!
But back to my thoughts
Listening to the lesson, maybe I 'ought,
Although really, I doubt I'd learn a lot,
If anything, I'd just get annoyed and distraught.
When does the long awaited bell ring?
That sets me free and makes me want to sing?
To get out of this room, I am dying,
Oh, I'd do anything to hear that bing, bing, bing!
