A Modern Talking Bird

A modern talking bird
Is Bri Edwards,
How much he talks! And is too hot! !
But these traits will help him to write
Some big books
With his wife,
I am sure
About everybody will wonder
For these will be so super
In words, similes, imageries, metaphors
In meaning, rhyming and verses
And I will be one of these buyers.
