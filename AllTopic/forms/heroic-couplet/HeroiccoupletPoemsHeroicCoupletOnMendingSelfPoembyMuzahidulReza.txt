▐
Living in the earth you are always dreamt
In the extra light, heavy merriment,
Then you are in the over ecstasy
Have been unnecessarily busy,
So, now you have no such extra moment
Even after analyzing self count. [iambic form]
▐▐
Hold and halt
The increasing fault,
Amend right now
You are only you,
And step the right path
Along with truth.[modern form]
▐▐▐
Now the time is
And that will come thus,
You will see surely
No one helps truly,
This world is cruel place
For a moment it is.[modern form]
▐▐▐▐
So this moment
For self you do spend,
Mending your mind
Mending your faith,
Along with worldly working
Along with mending.[modern form]
