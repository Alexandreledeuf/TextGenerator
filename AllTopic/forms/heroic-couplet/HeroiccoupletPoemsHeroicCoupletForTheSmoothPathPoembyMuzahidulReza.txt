Heroic Couplet For The Smooth Path
February 25, 2019
I am on the way to destination
Therefore, I have been walking from morning;
You remove from here all of frustrations,
Here all the paths, except one are unsmooth;
You kindly alot for me all that are smooth,
Of course, I'll obey your order, warm both.
