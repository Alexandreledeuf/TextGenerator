The Pastoral Heroic Couplet
February 24, 2020
The early morning starts with moo and baa
Shepherd opens door singing la, la, la;
Bleat, bleat continue the goats and the sheep
The shepherd starts sipping on the hot cup,
Soon all get ready for pastoral field
Day long eating, feeding, singing go right.
