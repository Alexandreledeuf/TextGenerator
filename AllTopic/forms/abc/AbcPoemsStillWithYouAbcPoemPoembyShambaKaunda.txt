Against all odds in still with you,
Beaten and bruised we made it through,
Counting the things I did to you that were so untrue,
Days and the nights I couldn't stand your view,
Emotions that I shattered, the trust and the tears too,
Frankly I couldn't and can't survive a minute in your
shoe,
Games I played and all the pain I put you through,
Heartily you stack to me like glue.
I need you, I needed you and I will need you,
Joy of my life with you my worries are few,
Keep my heart, you kept it safe and because of you I
grew,
Light of my soul, you're my early morning dew.
Mystique love you gave made my dark skies blue,
Nothing I could be If I didn't have you,
Open up my eyes you showed me love I never knew,
Painted my days with passion and sweet memories
too,
Quality love that made me flew,
Roses and rainbows, my love for you will always be
true,
Showered me with affection so warm and cool,
Tenderness that will always remain new.
Unique are all the things you do,
Voice of a thousand angels its you I'm used to.
Wants, needs, desires are all quenched if I have you,
X-ray my heart and see what I feel for you,
You're my happiness the one I will always come
home to,
Zip yourself inside my heart and if I die let me die
with you.
