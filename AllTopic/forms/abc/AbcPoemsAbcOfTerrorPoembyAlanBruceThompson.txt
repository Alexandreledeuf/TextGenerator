Did the CIA tell the FBI that it knows the work of the IRA?
Just as the RCMP confused the PLO with Al-Quaieda?
The biggest weapon of terror is alphabetic confusion,
It blends together ignorance, fanaticism with dogmatic infusion.
For the homeless, poor and hungry, there is basic need,
To the yammering of the privileged and rich they do not heed.
Food and medicine for all is delayed by poor distribution,
It’s waylaid by the mighty against retribution.
It’s hardly a wonder the world’s a more dangerous place,
That the rich and famous try to escape into space.
But the Almighty knows who deserves to be here,
And it’s not the humble and poor, who have something to fear.
