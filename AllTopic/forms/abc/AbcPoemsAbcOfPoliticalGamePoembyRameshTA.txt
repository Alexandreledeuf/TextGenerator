All issues are politicized and political game is played
Before any solution is found for anything by politicians;
Careful manipulation with words they pull on the days in
Dragging all matters that can be solved till poll comes!
Every matter is kept in the back burner unless it's profitable
Fully satisfying their political mileage in the election;
Good or bad, they don't care except their victory is confirmed
However easy or difficult the coming elections are concerned!
Icon of the political arena takes the lion's share in the spoil;
Joint ventures too, they prefer, if the passage is easy to go through
Keeping in view a massive victory for the next term in power;
Likewise, the plan and move the coins to win in the political game!
Matters of vital importance they take up in hand to convince all;
No matter however tedious or trivial once they become popular sure;
Opposition parties, if they are strong, grease their palms to win;
People are hoodwinked as all things take place behind the curtain!
Questions of burning problems are prolonged till people forget them;
Respecting the sentiments of the people, they play the game long
Surviving, sustaining and succeeding in every move of their game;
The final stage is placed in great suspense to take advantage of weakness!
Ultimately the good hearted and innocent people are the victims;
Varieties of cosmetic lures they make like expert advertisements to
Win in the polls to power only to play the card of sentiments ever!
X men like display of their influence they show to cajole new ones;
Years of such techniques make them experts in winning the game sure;
Zero is the benefit and solution to problems people get forever...!
