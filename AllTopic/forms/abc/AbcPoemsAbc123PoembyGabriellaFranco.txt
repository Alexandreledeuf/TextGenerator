ABC... I can't go on
123... what's the next one?
My mind is scrambled
My heart is confused
You're holding on to me.
What do I do?
What's the next letter in my name?
What's the next emotion I'll exclaim?
A sound is part of a word and a word, a meaning
Just like you want to be part of me
And you are, though you can't see
Without you, darling, there is not me
I don't know which way is up
And without you, I don't feel much
You say 'I'm holding on, and I'm not letting go'
You said the same things to her, you know
Then you dropped her, just like that
And you'll leave me at the dropp of a hat
I know you say, it's not the same
But darling, i don't feel that way
I don't share your infatuation
You need a reevaluation
Of your emotions, stop for a minute. Think.
You won't get drunk if ya don't take a drink
Ya get me? understand, please
Please stop idolizing me!
Just because I'm saying no
Doesn't mean i'm playing hard-to-get
Sometimes, no means no, hun
That's something not to forget
ABC... I can't go on
123... what's the next one?
My mind is scrambled
My heart is confused
You're holding on to me.
What do I do?
What's the next letter in my name?
What's the next emotion I'll exclaim?
I'm being honest with you at best
Breaking the eroding heart inside my chest
What's the next letter in my name?
What's the next emotion I'll exclaim?
A sound is part of a word and a word, a meaning
Just like you want to be part of me
