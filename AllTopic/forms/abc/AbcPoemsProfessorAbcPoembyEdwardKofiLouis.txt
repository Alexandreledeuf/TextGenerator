Free hands!
Free style!
Little, big!
The night was very short;
But, the meat must be well salted.
Professor ABC!
Without the sun there is no wine;
Sweet candy!
Manifesto,
The soil is needed for a better wine.
Tendency,
Tertiary,
Professor ABC!
To touch it,
To feel it,
To top it;
But, the sun needs the water.
