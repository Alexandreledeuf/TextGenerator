I’m scared terrified beyond my worst nightmare
Alight with emotions raw and bare as the open soil just after ploughing
I don’t understand, can’t avoid-won’t admit
Boldness: lost and exchanged for involuntary bashfulness
I care for u-about your occasional cold, your state of mind everything: gosh-is it wrong to do so?
Carelessly I drift into a different world-one where light flashes across one’s face blurring logical reasoning
I like hearing from u-a mere “hi” sends my tiny heart fluttering above my head
Dare not: say a word for the tiny rope I hang onto would leave me timidly on the floor
I dream of having a full conversation with u: just to spend time enveloped in an atmosphere of tranquil
Eager beaver I am: yet I shudder to imagine such
I’d fidget around for a while: such is expected for flesh alone can’t carry the weight of feeling so
Flowing through my veins-my heart-my body: my being blood of passion
I feel like our souls are intoxicatingly bound by forces beyond our own control-playing us for fools
Grasping at invisible strands that keep us in control of what we don’t others to see
You are more than just an acquaintance, a companion an interest
Heaven-sent, sun-kissed, mind-blowing out of this world
You awaken parts within me: I’ve known never to exist Alas: my fickle heart
Idleness overpowered drowning in pools of confusion, losing the very essence of me
You have a power I wish I could take away: the influence-the strength aiding my helplessness
Just as a fledgeling surrenders to motherly nurturing: I depend
You are a dream that has evolved into reality
Kinder words I can’t express tongue-tied I’ve become
You are imperfectly you- drawing me closer to that which I refuse to surrender to
Let me be…for such I can’t handle-set I free break my chains
You hold the keys to happiness, deeper existence, worthwhile peace
A chest-full of secrets and answers
Magical, manipulative, melodious, mellow, miraculous, misunderstood, momentous, mortifyingly-merry, mythical LOVE CAN NOT BE FOR EVERYONE…SOME OF US FEEL THE NEED TO BE:
Free as the bird flying high-gazing upon mountains of flowers blossoming under the blazing sun Watching as creatures on the land toil away Foolish yet safe
As painful as it is: And forever it shall be: I sacrifice You-not because of selfishness, pity nor any fault But because I CARE GO on Break away- for I am not Brave enough! O  Sweet misery
