What happen if my name is 'HAPPY '
When I am sad.
If people call me,
I wouldn't say Yes.
What if my name is 'BITTER '
While people call me sweetheart.
Life's already difficult to get a name like this,
Now diabetes is also coming close to me.
What if my name is 'CRY ',
Meanwhile people stress we should smile.
Like I've offended the world,
Committed many crimes.
But lucky that my name is 'ABBY SZE',
As simple as that.
Usually they call me 'ABC',
I've immuned to this joke.
But i did like how they laugh at this,
Having their own time.
Hey, what if my name is 'CDE'......
