a walk to have
be the one
come with the truth
dream the best not the worst
even if the worst is true
forget about it
give in? not a chance
have to walk back
i know you dont want to
just do it anyways
know the truth
live it
move on
never a chance to stay in front
over your head
people will say
queen will agree
rest your head at night
stay still
tighten up
up in the view
view is right
walk that way
xylophone plays in the background
you are doing right
zero mistakes you made in this walk
