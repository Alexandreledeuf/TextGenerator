Can I break tradition?
Will it be okay?
I'll ruin your mission,
'Cause I want a say
In this life of mine
I have no control
The voice of the divine
Speaks to my soul
Trapped in a position
To act against my will
This is the worst condition
That makes you want to kill
I don't want to be you
