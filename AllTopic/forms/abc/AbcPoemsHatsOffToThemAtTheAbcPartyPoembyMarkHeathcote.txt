Hats off to them at the ABC party
Apathy, Bankrolling, Corruption
Party, vote now, each vote counts
Singularly void of any or all hope
And will be counted as the majority.
Vote now for the unelected ABC party
Where the majorities ludicrous voice
Shall be quashed disdained ridiculed
And finally registered and rejected
Until finally they're all
Behaving like the master's gundog,
Hats off to them at the ABC party
Apathy, Bankrolling, Corruption
Party, vote now, each vote counts
In their struggle of conquer-and-divide.
