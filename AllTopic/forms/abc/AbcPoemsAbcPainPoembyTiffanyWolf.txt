A   gain with the pain,
B   eing left alone.
C   rying in the rain,
D   escending like stone.
E   very one laughs and points,
F   elt paralyzed through my spine.
G   etting looser at the joints,
H   earing about you, who used to be mine.
I   ncomplete is how I am feeling,
J   ust going through this day by day.
K   ill the pain I am concealing,
L   ove never again this way!
M   ental note to keep in mind,
N   ear to the end of my road.
O   bviously I was a little blind,
P   hrasing your words in code.
Q   uiet down and leave me be,
R   ush yourself to a far off place.
S   ee how bad you've hurt me,
T   rying to forget your face.
U   nited we once were,
V   eered off to one side.
W   elcomed you...  Immature,
X - perienced... My love had to subside.
Y   ou aren't here, but you are there,
Z   ipping up these emotions, because now I don't care!
