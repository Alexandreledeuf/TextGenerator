A
Boy
Can
Do
Everything he
Feels like doing, if he
Gets his
Homework done and
In on time
Just as his teacher instructs
Kudos goes to he who
Loves
Math
Now he does have the
Option to
Play or
Quietly
Read and do
Schoolwork
Today after lunch
Unless he doesn’t do
Very
Well on his math problem
X-2=3²
Yet he
Zealously gets his schoolwork done.
