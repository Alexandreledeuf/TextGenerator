Awake ye gostely persones awake awake
Bothe preste pope bisshoppe & Cardinall.
Considre wisely what wayes that ye take
Daungerously beynge lyke to haue a fall.
Every where the mischefe of you all.
Ferre and nere breaketh oute very fast
Godde will nedes be revenged at the last.
Howe longe haue ye the worlde captyued
In sore bondage of mennes tradiciones?
Kynges and Emperoures ye haue depryued
Lewedly vsurpynge their chefe possessiones.
Muche misery ye make in all regiones.
Nowe youre fraudes almoste at the latter cast
Of godde sore to be revenged at the last.
Poore people to oppresse ye haue no shame
O wakynge for feare of your doubble tyranny.
Rightfull iustice ye haue put out of frame
Sekynge the lust of youre godde the belly.
Therfore I dare you boldely certifye.
Very litle though ye be therof a gast
Yet god will be revenged ar the last.
