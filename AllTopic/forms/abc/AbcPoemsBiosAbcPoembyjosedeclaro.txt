Who’s to be blamed when things goes out wrong?
Who’s the culprit who messes up our song?
Who’s the author that governs this plight?
Who is he? Who is he? Who turns off the light?
Deprived of light and so we cannot see.
It’s only us who whirls the elese.
In our life’s ending, we hold the key.
Can’t we just drive and take it easy?
Coz I think to live life is so simple,
Doesn’t need to mix it up with trouble.
All you need is to sweeten up the flavor.
Then you’ll see your kissi’n up your neighbor.
Must kill, the undying love of hatred.
Declare war against envy and greed.
Imagine a world that lives in peace,
See the people spreading hug and kisses.
He says “remove vexation from your heart”.
Keep his word, walk tall and be smart.
You should live your life to the fullest,
Make the most of it before it’s too late.
I write this song as a reminder,
Coz our stay in here is not forever.
It’s inevitable, time just runs out,
So, go out of your shell and make a shout.
And my friend if in case you’re in trouble,
You should not worry you’ll just make it double.
One thing may help; wear a smile in your face,
Coz worrying wouldn’t’ add up your days.
