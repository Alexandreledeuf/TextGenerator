Again the rain is back after a year or so,
Buzzing of the clouds jolts one and all.
Clouds are having no mercy.
Drops of water are dazzling on the leaves.
Everyone is enjoying a cup of hot coffee or tea.
Fingers are trying to catch those tiny drops.
Ground is flooded with flowing water.
Hairs are unable to hold the water.
In every way I wish to dance, but I couldn't do so.
Juxtapose the mountains and hill it gushes,
Kazoo of paper boat makes music to the ears.
Love the fall and on the tin roof.
My life rejuvenates after seeing this beauty again.
No other occasion makes me feel esthetic.
Over and above the sky gets cleared.
Pulling up our umbrellas I enjoy a walk.
Quite interesting it is to take a ride on a bike.
Rinsing the dirt settled on the building and the floors.
Surprised I am, by the package of a lightning in between.
Tonight reflection of the moonbeams will enthrall.
Unique nature will pay a tribute to the clouds.
Very happy I am, flying without wings.
What a joy to all the living creatures.
Xylem of energy will flow everywhere.
Yes, my heart, my body and my soul all wet tonight.
Zillion drops scattered all over the earth again.
