A total lack of trust
Because of past hurts
Cut me down so low,
Drowning in my lonliness
Enveloped by the pain
From one thing or another
Give it another shot
Hard as it may be
I can not and do not want to lose hope
Just because some people are jerks
Keep your chin up
Look beyond the pain and hurt
Make the best of your situation
Never expect anything from anyone, for
One other than yourself may
Prey upon your weaknesses
Quit allowing anybody in.
Remember, no one will meet all expectations
Stick to your guns
Treat everyone the same
Ugly as so many may be
Vivid projection of their grotesque demeanor
Worldly people,  full of hate
X-ray their hearts to the best of your abilities
You and only you can control your happiness, be
Zealous in all things happy
