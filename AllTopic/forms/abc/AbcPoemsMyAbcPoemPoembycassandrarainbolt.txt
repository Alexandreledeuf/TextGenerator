Allowing your way
Blaming my name
Claiming it was me
During your game
Enduring the silence
Forgetting our fight
Gaining my trust
Hoping were alright
Insisting you love me
Justifying your choice
Knowing its a lie
Listening to your voice
Missing our laughs
Noting my flaws
Owning my heart
Prisoned in your jaws
Quieting my thoughts
Reading my heart
Sighing on the inside
Thinking of the start
Underestimating my strength
Versing your pefectness
Writing this poem
Xing you worthlessness
You were a jerk
Zeroing in on my weakness
