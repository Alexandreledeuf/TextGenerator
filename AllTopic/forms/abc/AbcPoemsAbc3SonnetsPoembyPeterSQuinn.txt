- A - Every Man Is a Child
Every man is a child of his dreams
Searching through each his going and true coming
From the days that have given some their deems
With each their lost and found in their fathoming
Rivers never go dry with understanding
Those that are found in the deep of the heart
Strange weirdness is there constantly demanding
Adventurous thoughts of their counterpart
Lives central things make the world go around
Like a simple smile shining through tomorrow
Where childhood happiness is often found
Even those that once were buried in sorrow
Before you judge any man try to love him
With your compassion in times turmoil's brim
- B - The Inside of Everything
The inside of everything's still glowing
With wonderments you can never be without
In a go to go it’s always there showing
To give you its promises with any doubt
Light of its sweetness that never goes away
In from your true and beautiful that's you
Playing on moments that feelings only play
Something in its times that is here new
The deep secrets from your heart and its beat
Like the rose buds in the thorns of their touch
That in your way of lives each to treat
Giving hope of much or only some of such
Everything that's from inside of the deep
From love and its feelings - for always to keep
- C - Those Times
Those times that is changing from young to old
In searching the world and looking around
The days of the new that no moments can hold
And you in your feeling have some there found
Like understandings of views that come and go
Drip of the times the lost in its looking
Past flowers in moment’s memories heigh-ho
That through your roots onward is on hooking
Playing eccentricities to make you feel good
Keeping you as child in life without reason
Each of its compensate and true brotherhood
Changing in adventurous for each season
The strangeness of the ways that love and give
A childhood of conquest to reinvent and live
