Life,
From ABC to XYZ;
Learning all the time to become perfect,
With the laws of life!
And all the rules aroun nature.
ABC!
Like the beginning;
Like Genesis,
With the Chronicles of life.
XYZ!
Like the end,
With Revelations;
Learning all the time,
Under the umbrella of Righteous Laws! !
To become perfect one day.
