I got to ‘A’ and was assaulted and abused
And attacked and ambushed and anger was used
And acute agony left me anxious and bemused
Then went to ‘B’ and got bloodied and battered
And burnt and bashed and bruises were scattered
And beaten and bones were broken and shattered
I then gave up when a friend told me
Worse things happen at ‘C’
