Animals are my friends
Baby animals I like best
Cats live in my house
Dude is one of the five cats
Everyday I have to feed them
Feeding time is funny to watch
Growling and hissing starts
Hitting and scratching are next
If you put their food dishes close
Justin’s cat is called Jack-Jack
Kittens are cute but they grow up
Litter box litter box, you smell bad
Mom’s cat is called Whoa – Dxx-xx
None of the other cats like Phantom
Only my brother Andrew helps him
Phantom is a black and white cat
Queen of house we have none, only male cats
Rabbits are my next pets, I have two
Snakes, we had three, now only one
Turtles we had before, but they got away
Ugly or cute, I love all my pets
Very few animals I do not like
Wales are too big to be pets
X, I don’t have, but could try an Ox
Yak is another animal I don’t have
Zebra, it is like a striped horse, I love them too
