When education becomes business, it loses value;
That too technical education after becoming so,
Manufactures products of degree holders sans no
Hope of future and knowledge to stand on one's legs!
Not knowing history and world's future, these technicians
Sans general knowledge too, don't know how to change
Their attitude and try their level best in some other line,
When the particular line of job becomes out of reach ever!
Caught in the quagmire, they become depressed due to
Their obsession and roam around as lunatics not knowing
Where they stand and where they have to go in this world
To achieve their aim and get fulfilment in the course of time!
Whatever be the education, it is just the ABC of language;
Using it with creative ability only, one can shine in any field!
