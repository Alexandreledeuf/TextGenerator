If life was as simple
As ABC
I would climb on
My bicycle,
Ride to the sea
I would rip off
My clothes,
Unbuckle my boots,
Run naked over
Lapping waves,
Ignore all the looks
I would swim out
On the ocean,
Swim back twice as fast,
Tie a scarf around
My waist,
Forget the troubled past
I’d cycle back
To Belfast, walk
Naked through the town,
Convince the people
I’m the one,
A Prophet of renown
I’d be like John
The Baptist,
My scarf around
My loins,
I’d shout my
Head off
Through the streets
And dodge
The flying coins
I know they’d think
I’m crazy,
I know they’d
Want me dead,
Because I know
They don’t like change,
I know I’d lose, my head
