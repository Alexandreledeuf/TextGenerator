A abc angles on angels flaws (poem)
Mix with means and assets
Passive and active to abase the men
Heels and knees rent for renown
Breeds the breads to be demanded
Assert to assist by blocks of boards
Necks and necks to bad affairs
Moneys pay for debts in doubles
Laws are raw to protect with doubts
Shams are shames to have costs
Shams on sheets incubated courses
Lack of actions to freedoms and justices
Nouns are in ounces and loves are in pounds
Control the concepts of wielding guns
Control the concepts of smith for guns
Put the concepts of tyrants on hell
To hell real tyrants have helps
Hounds and eagles should focus on hunting
Expect the evils to be saints on junctions
Axes and awls are lying below
Awnings are answers with piss and pee
Peek on peaks of powers to be laws
Whales on whips are wheat to sharks
Weeps when sweep in clocks of Gods
Corrections of cotillions like hoofs
Zeroes in zeal for facts and morals
Morales are guns that march and move
Laws are lost and twist a lot
Terms in targets have not effects in long
Stay in dark or run from dart.
Stray to cycles of cruel ranges
Laws as can be rights are none
Table lands are tables with spoons
Monks have manners to list on tables
Jack apples are appetites on tabs
Whales on whips are wheat to sharks
Baby fishes are preys in bays
To be back in the passes to wash by bloods
In themes of theory our rights are loud
Next days are dated with truths or false
Flaws in angles of angels are small
Wings when wink to rains give no shelters
Bloods are buses to carry to hell
Wash their shames but leave our rights
A network of flatterers is in wires
