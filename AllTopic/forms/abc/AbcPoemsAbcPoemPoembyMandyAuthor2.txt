Another thought comes to mind,
Before it can be stopped,
Carefully i tread,
Down the path,
Every step a new mistake,
Free from thoughts,
Going no where,
Hating the way thing are,
Itching for a change,
Just a small change,
Knowing it never will,
Loving him still,
Making it worse,
Never an escape,
Once it's begun,
Pleading for it to end,
Quiet now,
Resting from the sleepless night,
Sincerely wishing for peace,
Taking everything,
Under the shelter,
Vex me no more,
Waiting for it,
X-rays of my heart,
Yearning for cover,
Zero strength left
