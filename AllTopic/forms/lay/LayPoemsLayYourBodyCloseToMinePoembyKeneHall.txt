Lay your body close to mine
Let me hold you firmly tight,
Lay your head on my shoulder
Cry your tears inside my heart,
I’ll dry them with my love
An’ change them into smiles.
I lost that game of love
An’ just quietly stepped aside,
I knew that guy would do you wrong
What he said was just old lies,
Could feel and see it
In those dark conniving eyes.
Anger is an honest emotion
Let your feelings flow,
I love you; just want you to be happy.
If ever you see me in another light
I’ll be there for you baby,
Shining diamond bright,
Close your eyes now darling
No more tears in the night.
