With the yapping Corgi puppy walked
Daughter safely an Oklahoma Indian reservation
Wife heating up hot shower pipes
I can at last do
What even my ailing body has denied
Write.
So to you dear Saint Helen
Patron saint of a poet out of favor
May the Great Other bless you
For your reading eyes of extant work
Friendship
Tea
Offering to pick up the tab at lunch
Education on food
Wise medical counsel
Use of your first rate lap pool
For all these blessings bestowed
Here where we struggle
Thank You.
