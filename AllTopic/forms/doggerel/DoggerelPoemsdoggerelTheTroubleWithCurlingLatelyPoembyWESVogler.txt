Watching curling can be really wonderous
The screaming and pleading is often thunderous
Then there's the team makes you yammer
Takingzero to retainthe hammer
Pot-shotting with minimum skill
So boring the crowd's set to kill
(Seven rocks in the circle is great
When barely an inch can settle your fate)
Alberta is running a winning streak
With an audience at the lowest peak.
Final score, typic'ly... two to one
Not watching no more til something is done
(the five rock rule is not enough)
