(doggerel)Driving With Dotty
"There's a scratch on our bumper, the rear
It's in the back seat ... hello, dear? "
She has fin'lly pulled out all the stops
Season ticket's awarded to her by the cops
Dotty's gone to England... she's told
It is legal to drive on her side of the road
She backed neatly out of the garage all right
But she forgot she backed in last night
