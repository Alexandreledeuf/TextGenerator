there'd be......
Catchy hang-from-the-ceiling fly paper
designed in a plaid as a caper
Or something quite snappy in rubber bands,
A comb and wax paper you play with your hands
Paper short shorts.. from the comic section
May very well be a most-called for selection
Just say what you'd like
And I'd hop on my bike
And ful-fill your conniving commands
If I was running a store.
