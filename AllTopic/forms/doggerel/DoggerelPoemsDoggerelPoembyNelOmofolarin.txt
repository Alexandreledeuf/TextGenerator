Dumb dukes distort dignified doctrines
Desecrates divinely distinct districts
Daily decimates definite dashing destinies.
Dear dimwitted, deftly-daft dudes,
Thy despicable digression duly delineates dementia!
Daddy devil's dire disciple's delight.
Doesn't demo-crazy depict delimiting dauntless demotic delightfulness?
Democracy, a delusive, demagogic despotic demonstration?
Dialysis! denominators do dearly denounce despotic devout!
Demystify these dense desperate desultory designations
Detoxify its deadly, doctrinal diph-theric dispersion
Deploy diligent delegates, denouncing dippy deity in deafening decibels
Deposing the despot down-towards deep, dark dungeon
Disestablishing despotic democracy, a dictum disclosure of his demise
