Two old men sitting on a public bench, One was telling a
woeful tale which was puzzling. "I am married to a beautiful
twenty-four year old girl. She can't get enough sex and she
thinks I am a wonderful lover."
"I am puzzled. My mind's like a sieve.
With a girl that has all that to give,
What's the problem, Pat?
And what's bad about that? "
"I've no blessed idea where I live."
