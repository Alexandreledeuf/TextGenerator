I showed my goat how to play chess
she was quite good, was not the best.
She ate the board and made a mess
and failed the Goatly challenge test.
She ran amok in the judging tent.
Her rivals thought it was heaven sent!
Pawns and Bishops all got bent,
the Trophy? Twas just a little dent.
So, no more chess, I've thrown that out,
I could not handle the goatly pout.
So, over crisps, and a pint of stout,
We'll discuss the art of tickling trout.
