Ella is my sausage dog,
Her legs are undersize,
Her tail wags like a metronome,
Her brown eyes mesmerize.
Ella's nose is polished black,
Her sense of smell's acute,
Her stomach is an endless pit,
She's really rather cute.
She's fond of eating Rom the cat,
He doesn't seem to mind.
She bites his neck and chews his head.
She isn't very kind.
She also chases cockatoos
And lies beside the fire
Upon her back like snoopy dog
Replete with Mr. Tyre.*
Ella is my dearest love.
I walk her every day
I know she loves me eagerly,
She licks my face away!
*Mr. Tyre is her favorite toy, a present from the one who feeds her.
