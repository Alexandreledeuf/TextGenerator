Though to my reputation as a writer it has come at a cost
I feel grateful to doggerel without it I would feel lost
Though the stuff I pen won't outlive me failed by the test of time
But what matter it makes me happy for to pen doggerel rhyme
For many years and Seasons I have been a rhyme buff
And I have written one might say a lot of rhyming stuff
But anybody can pen rhyme 'tis easy as can be
Like bill does always rhyme with hill and bee does rhyme with tree,
No two do look at life the same that's how it does seem to me
Through our different eyes as the wise one said a different World we see
Suppose we would be boring if we all thought in the same way
Our different views on life makes  us interesting as some are known to say
The type of stuff I pen in book form the sort that does not sell
But to rhyming I'm addicted and I do love doggerel.
