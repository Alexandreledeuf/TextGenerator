I am only a scribbler of doggerel not even a very minor poet
But it does not bother me in the least that i'll never be one of literary note
I will die as i live just a rhymer though that does not bother me at all
I feel happy with my gifts and blessings though my gifts and blessings are small
I must be an addictive rhymer though i am always happy penning rhyme
Though i never get paid for my effort  and many see that as a waste of time
Those who tell me that i should quit rhyming their advice i always ignore
I am happy when rhymes i am penning something you have heard me say before
The rhymes to me seem to keep coming and on notepaper i jot them down
But not for money or recognition or any sort of literary renown
I do it for my self enjoyment though my better days in the long gone
And till the reaper claims the life from me as a rhymer i'll keep penning on
I will die as i live a mere rhymer  as you may have heard me say before
And those who tell me to give away rhyming their advice i always ignore.
