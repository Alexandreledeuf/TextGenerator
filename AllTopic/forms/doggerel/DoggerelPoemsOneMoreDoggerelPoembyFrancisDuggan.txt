I am one with rhyme words who does love to play
And for me it has been one more doggerel day
And though my worth as a rhymer as ever i do doubt
There are no shortage of things for to write rhymes about
The fourth day of March in the calendar Fall
But it does not feel that much like Autumn at all
It seems like a warm day in Summer with just a slight breeze
On a weather temperature high for the day of close to thirty degrees
In the mostly blue sky just a few clouds of gray
In the shade of the trees the cattle chewing their cuds lay
Among the rank grass the color of hay
Not good for cattle weight gain would seem true to say
With the sun on their dark wings chirping as they fly
Welcome swallows chasing flying insects across the sky
And with so little time to mate, lay eggs and breed
The cabbage white butterflies flit above the mustard weed
Such beautiful weather for the time of year
The warbling of the magpies are pleasant to hear
And in a familiar voice to many and familiar to me
The black and white magpie larks singing pee wee.
