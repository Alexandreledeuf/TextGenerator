With her deep ripped jeans and guy she came
Wearing an AAMCO transmission t-shirt
She talked dogs, about the breeds we loved
Stories of their heroism - a little
Particular animals yet without name
Her boy friend was there on a mission
She was going into the military in two weeks
He wanted to take a little pressure off the Basic
Training process
It was a tender thing to see her touch him - lightly
Before they went out
To shoot the first tactical rifle
He had ever acquired
In a trade of a jeep and a gun for a car,
Where she got the jeep out of the deal.
