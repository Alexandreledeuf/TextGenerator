AnAttempt To Write In Another Form Other
Than The Limerick (by request)
The mantra Ray.. do not get in his way
And you'll want to be rid of the squid
Hark! Hark! ... The great white shark...
Don't bother, just do as you're bid.
That's all I've to say on the day
And I've no idea why I said it
Just to empty my mind if I may
And thanks very much if you read it
