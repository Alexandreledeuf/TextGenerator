Haven’t much time
I’ll get straight to the point.
Poetry tells
not of me and what’s mine.
Does the tale shake the dog,
can the tale make a rhyme?
If you think that that’s true
you’re barking up the wrong tree.
The poetry tells of that which is true
all the wonderful truths
that lie inside you.
‘Tis the dog wags the tale
and when this is true
we have all the beauty
that’s living in you.
