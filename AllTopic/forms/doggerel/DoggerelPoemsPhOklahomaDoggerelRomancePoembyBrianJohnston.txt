Give me love that I've worked for, no more, but no less,
For no man is deserving, I freely confess!
I don't need understanding, that complicates things,
And seeds fool expectations out home on the range.
Truth is not what I need from you, meals help, of course,
Learned to hitch my ass, long ago, well before horse.
If your funny bone's struck that I hope for a dance,
Girl, with funds in my pocket, a corpse has more chance
To gain weight in the ground. Would it help to behave
Or do you prefer naughty boys? Maybe a slave?
I've more wrinkles than you'll ever see in a pool.
I've done time as Court Jester, but pass on its fool!
I do sweat fierce when heated up, shiver alone,
Known to whip up some poetic times on the phone
When you'd think I might not! Tend to think best on 'pot, '
But investments I make there don't get out a lot!
Heard your friend call you Mable, well my name is Jake
If my poetry's fable, these looks girl ain't fake.
I'm as real as it gets, don't get votes from no tweets,
Spayed by multiple vets, still got spin in these sheets!
