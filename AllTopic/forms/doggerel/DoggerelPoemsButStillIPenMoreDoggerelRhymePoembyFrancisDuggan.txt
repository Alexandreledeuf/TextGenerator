I may be years past my life's prime
But still I pen more doggerel rhyme
'Tis just a way of life with me
To write on everyday things I see
I've never claimed to be a poet
Or one worthy of minor literary note
I just post my stuff to internet site
And I write because I love to write
Some who know I pen stuff to me do say
Why don't you give writing away
Since for it you don't receive pay
But still I write more every day
And what others think of me is fine
Since that is their business not mine.
