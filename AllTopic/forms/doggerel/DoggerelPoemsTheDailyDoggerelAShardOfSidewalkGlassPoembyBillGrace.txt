A shard of glass
Sidewalk found,
Not on the black velvet of
Jeweler's drape
Thing of beauty,
Wrested from another plane
Often in action's shame
Small portion of the main
Which we seldom see -
The nature of common store -
Till broken and
Released,
Shard of simple silver fire
of sidewalk glass.
