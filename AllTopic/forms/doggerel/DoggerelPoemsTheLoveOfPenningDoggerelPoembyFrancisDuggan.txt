The love of penning doggerel in me does remain
Though for me in such there's no financial gain
I write for enjoyment that and nothing more
That's something you may have heard me say before
My best days in life to the forever gone
But for as long as i can i will keep rhyming on
Yes i will keep rhyming despite those who say
That i should give my literary ambitions away
For many years i have been a rhyming buff
I am one who has written a whole pile of stuff
And though writing does not bring me money or fame
It is something i do quite enjoy doing just the same
And for to give it away i do not have a plan
I just hope to keep doing it for as long as i can.
