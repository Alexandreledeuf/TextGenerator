she says's it's raining
out no mo'
so I  guess this rhyme
has got to go
the white stuff's falling
she say's it's snow
I wrote about rain
but it had to go
so the poem I worked on
with so much pain
must disappear
just like the rain
so the rain has turned
into flake
this poem is over
it's my mistake...
sorry...
