I know that she does have me under her spell
The one who is known as Goddess Doggerel
Every morning she whispers in my ear and say
I order you to pen more doggerel today
She claims to be my friend but i know she is my foe
But i lack in the mental strength for to her to say no
So her every order i feel compelled to obey
One reason i cannot give penning doggerel away
Her spell of addiction she has cast on me
And only in death of her i will be free
She preys on the minds of every aspiring to be poet
Of those who will never become worthy of literary note
She pretends she is my friend though i know she is my foe
And i lack in the mental strength for to her to say no.
