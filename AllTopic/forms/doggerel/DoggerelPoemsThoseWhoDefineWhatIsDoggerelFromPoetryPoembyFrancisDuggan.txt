Those who define what is doggerel from poetry in their own ways seem small
To them even a well written rhyme poem is not poetry at all
Are their souls without music is poetry not song
Or is my thinking outdated have I got it wrong?
What to them is or is not poetry is their business not mine
They have their opinions and that suits me fine
As for me one who can't separate blank verse from prose
Must be unenlightened one would have to suppose.
Yet I do not apologize for my liking of rhyme
And for my favourite poets I must go back in time
And perhaps I do seem old fashioned in my antiquated way
When I say I do not have a liking of the poems of the major poets of today.
Of one deceptive modernist terminology I have taken note
There is no such a thing as a doggerel poet
The point of music in rhyme they somehow seem to miss
But even amongst some of the highly educated ignorance can be bliss.
