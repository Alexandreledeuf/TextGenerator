Where have all the heroes gone?
Heroes to boast of we may have none
With his shiny kris Lapulapu struck with ease
Magellan’s head flew above the mangrove trees
Henceforth spiny fish was named after him for good
While Magellan became an exclusive neighborhood
Most of our heroes lost their fights
Without reaching glorious heights
Gregorio’s Tirad is a poor copy of Thermopylae
Wretched devil killed by rats with silver dollar pay
Samson pushed columns, caused a temple to fall
Bernardo Carpio mere crags…a mountain wall
Darna zoomed our skies with a tousled mane
Wonder Woman on first class in her invisible plane
Vhong Navarro’s Lastikman stretched arms snapped
Plastic Man’s rubbery limbs had evil men trapped
Oh, for a hero to get us through the political morass
Man of steel, moral, honest and not an ass
We have lionized several in the past and how
We bent over in a subservient kempetai bow
Malakas at Maganda was a promising pair
Until conjugal corruption filled the air
FPJ stopped the bad guys with fast draw forty five
Wrestling GDPs and GNPs would he come out alive?
Another ersatz hero still wanting a comeback
Asking for a chance to give the till one more whack
Can Super Gloria fight off villains of evil deed
Or the beloved marauder’s immoderate greed
Is our land a place where real heroes cannot thrive?
We’ve been manufacturing false heroes at an overdrive
The hero mill’s output is at a dismal low
All that have been produced had a flaw
Self styled heroes in Senate and Congress eager to get going
Natural wealth and country’s coffers are for the taking
Alas poor Juan’s wish for a hero may never come
“Alis  na  baka pati karsonsillo mo’y makamkam”*
