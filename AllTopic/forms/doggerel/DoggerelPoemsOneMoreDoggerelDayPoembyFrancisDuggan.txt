I am one with words who likes to have a play
For me it has been one more doggerel day
The stuff comes to my mind and i just pen it down
But never for money or any hope of renown
But so much to write about for anyone that way inclined
Though if poets are few poetasters not hard to find
It is easy so easy for one to pen rhyme
But only a poem does stand the test of time
Though your worth as a writer yourself you may doubt
There is always so much for one to write about
And if you enjoy writing as much as i do it is not a waste of time
Not to write at all would seem more of a crime
It has been one more doggerel day for me
Suppose we are what we are that's how it seems to be.
