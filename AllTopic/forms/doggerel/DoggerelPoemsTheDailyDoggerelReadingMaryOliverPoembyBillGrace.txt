Every evening I try to read her
five poems by Mary Oliver
five poems - no more - no less.
They free me to be still
they help me to be quiet
I - for five poems - do not apologize
to the world for who I am
that I exist
that I write bad poetry.
They give me strength
with which I go after reading
and help clean the cat box.
