Short Tutorial on Writing a Robert Frost Mastepiece
For the first three stanzas use a rhyming scheme of aaba, then the last stanza bbbb: now choose a mundane topic but being an egomaniac, pump it up to seem important. Like this:
I wandered by a shop's bright window
I saw a person I think I know
It was me, in the reflection clear
What a clever person it did show.
The shopkeeper did see me leer,
As I adored my image there
Reflecting like a modern bard
He must have marvelled to see me here.
My sciatica began to ache
So it was time for me a move to make
I shuffled by like a gimp with a limp
To leave admirers in my wake.
With my inheritance, no need to work
So I shared my gifts, no time to shirk
Mine was such a prestigious lurk
Very few knew, I was a jerk
