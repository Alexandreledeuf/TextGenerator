The mantle of greatness I never will don
But the demon of doggerel urges me to write on
He is in my mind and is controlling me
And of his influence I will never be free.
He is in my mind and he is in my soul
And my very existence he seems to control
He compels me to pen doggerel every day
With him I can't ever give writing away.
Though writing of slipshod verse is not a crime
He urges me to pen more doggerel rhyme
Poetasters are anonymous in every town
And they never do know of literary renown.
Since by the demon of doggerel I have been possessed
I cannot say of talent that I have been blessed
Due to his influence I feel compelled to write
And to post more stuff in to the internet literary site.
