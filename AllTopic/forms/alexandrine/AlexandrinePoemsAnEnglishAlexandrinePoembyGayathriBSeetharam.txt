An English Alexandrine
-Gayathri B. Seetharam
From Wikipedia and the internet, an iambic is an unstressed syllabic word followed by a long or stressed syllabic word. If an iambic hexameter is accompanied by a caesural (a pause to make sense)and rhyme, it is an Alexandrine. Please note: The character, /, denotes a caesural in my poem.
My heart would be broken, alas! / if PM Justin Trudeau
Were to not fulfill his promise, go against his apparently spoken word
And I would scale new heights of fame
And gain more of a name, I hope, in the artist's and writer's world and without a doubt, the engineer's world if he were to keep his word;
Mr. Prime Minister, I ask of you if I am on the Green Meridian Road
Having donned the maple leaf of viridian hue as a daily flowery garb since Jan 1994
Embroidered with roses as leaves, for if one rose in my life decides the median
The other rose, be that it may/ calculates the mean;
If I am positive, Canada feels pride in my achievements
There may be prejudice against the fact that my published work while special
Has not been published presentations and I find it difficult to swim against this tide of bureaucracy
And I wish for justice in my direction/, a fair granting of earnings;
There, I used the two abstract nouns in relative conjunction as Jane Austen had,
And since I watched the Hollywood versions of both Pride and Prejudice AND Persuasion without abstraction of thought,
I most certainly do not agree that at times, ‘'yielding to persuasion'' does not show ‘'feebleness of character''
In many ways, it shows vision against division in society;
Surely, I am making this poem take a serious bent of mind
And if a man in one's life is a find
Then since, one has to conform to the epithet of a feminist, / gentle persuasion from my side
Must be accompanied by missions which one completes;
On a relevant aside, I must mention Nick Hornby's book, Funny Girl, which is in tune with my taste thus far
In which a side character's wife, June, would have cried after their second episode of marital sex
And in passing, I thought that I like sex with my husband
Since it is a mix of the humdrum and the exotic and will always tell him with a straight face that I saw a thousand stars come together in a flash;
But it so happens that I also liked sex with other attractive, eligible and forthcoming men
However I swear that I am a one man woman also very much in love with my husband
But the snag with marital fidelity is that
The engineer-artist-painter-writer-poet in oneself does not get richer;
So to all those men out there, men in high places in engineering,
I offer a deal which comes with a to-die-for-face and natural big breasts and other attributes,
That along with considerable honest work from me with considerable pay from you
There comes a secret alliance, a sexual union, an offer from me, away from home
And this must be a home based project
And not a paid position
For my job prospects and resume and references are good.
