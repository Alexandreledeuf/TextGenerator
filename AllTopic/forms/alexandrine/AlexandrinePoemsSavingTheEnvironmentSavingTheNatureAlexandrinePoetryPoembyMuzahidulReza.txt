Saving the environment, saving the nature
We can ensure our future life style better
Environment is we grow up having all where
Whose position is nowhere but in this nature;
A plant grows up, produces flowers, fruits, oxygen
Flowers, fruits, oxygen are for beauty, food, life
A being grows up, produces offspring, rear them
Beings need those to live, plants need beings in help;
These both are major agents in environment
For them all other elements are circling
Coming out of womb or shell of egg the urgent
Are environment, nature for first, last living.

Alexandrine - Poem by Muzahidul Reza
Alexandrine, a wisely poem form
Twelve diphthongs in each of twelve lines
Major stresses are given on the sixth diphthong
And on the last one
And one secondary accent in each of half line,
Some alternatives are found
In case of no stresses on the last diphthong
Then thirteen diphthongs need in that line
Line is often called an alexandrine;
Originally, in French prosody, there is a twelve diphthong meter
And in English, here is iambic hexameter;
The rhyme scheme is a a b b (heroic alexandrine)
Or, a b a b (elegiac alexandrine)
With obligatory alternation of masculine and feminine rhymes;
In Russian poetry, iambic hexameter with a caesura
After the third foot
And with rhyme scheme of a a b b
And alternation of masculine and feminine rhymes;
In French, rhyming couplets of two alexandrines
Are of equal length, usually containing four accents,
Having been the classic poetic form
Since the time of Ronsard;
The form named, ‘Alexandrine'
Might drive from the fact that
Some poems of 12th and 13th century about Alexander the Great
Were written in this meter.
