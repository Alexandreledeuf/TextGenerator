Spring we started planting, after tilling the ground
Summer’s blissful weather, nature’s beauties resound
Tiny seedlings hatching, now grow towards the sun
Growing ever skyward, their growing nearly done
Summer’s growing season, its sights and smells and sound
Nature’s blessed harvest, brought in from all around
Autumn’s pleasant bounty, gathered from all the fields
Over until next year, winter’s coldness soon yields.
Nature has done her best, she has given her all
Coming hibernation, at the end of the fall
Wearily now waiting, knowing winter’s approach
Nature starts to wind down, at winters rude encroach
Now the ground is icy, snow drifting in the hedge
Waiting for the springtime, to cut winter’s cruel edge
Shortened daylight hours, winter’s darkest shadows
Slowly daylight lengthens, springtime surely follows.
