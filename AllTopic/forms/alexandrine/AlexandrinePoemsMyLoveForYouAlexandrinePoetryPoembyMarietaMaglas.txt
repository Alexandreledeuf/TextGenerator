Your love for me a little more than nothing means,
When love as sense of self may be, than mine, less strong.
The thrill of love may keep its paint on withered greens.
A night of dreams is like a sad and jerking song.
Your silence dances meaning’s words on face’s frown,
My eyes of winter watch the stream of light on high,
Emotions are a flow of words, while stripping down
Their sense of love to sound like a sad ‘’good bye’’.
With red unfolded kisses thrilling white delight,
The moon replaces missing sun with all around.
It makes me dance my will  in dreams’ abstract on height.
It makes me feel the love again and heals my wound.
