(Out Of Desert - An Arabian Sonnet)
Out of desert that came out guess him, mind
A golden touch; touched and turned into gold
All the agents before him soon appeared
Slowly all of them began to be touched;
In short time news reached far and far distance
Air changing around took the real place,
In the sky clouds gathered, fell rain of peace
Desert got soaked having great essence;
Environment instantly turned fertile
Desert saved from being ever futile
The inhabitants were no more hostile;
Great instance set in the heart of desert
The setter as a man is always great
Is considered at present was in past.
