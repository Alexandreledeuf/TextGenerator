We never found a way under his sway.
The elephant trampled us in the fray.
At Lion's carnal feast we did fall a prey.
The sun blinds us, but we still feel no ray.
For his sake, burning, we flared in his lie.
And his forceful flood left us high and dry.
His shady plot though stared us in our aye.
His sky made us vie to die, not to fly.
He was only bound by our own promise
To follow him and grow in common bliss!
His sweet song was but insane serpent's bliss!
Over our heads past and future gather.
In the desert we share manna, yonder,
Where angels and beasts will live together.
