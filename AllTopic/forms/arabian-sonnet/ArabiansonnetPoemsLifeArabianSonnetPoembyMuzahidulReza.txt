(Life In Arabian Sonnet)
Life, with body, mind and soul together
Walks the way to destination ever
From person to person it does differ
To some it is dark and to some is fair;
To many it has aim and some nothing
Aim supporters more or less try earning
Nothing supporters do mainly nothing
They are only with their lives so cheating;
Life firstly parts into body and soul
Body, the outer part is changeable
Many people call it fully mortal;
Soul is unchangeable, the inner part
So immortality is its chief fact
All the aim supporters believe it.
