Her spirit is as free as heaven's air,
the gorgeous girl whose love I long to share
while tripping through the light of passion's air
where I shall find the way to say I care.
If darkened eyes reveal a simple verse
can love be shown within a poet's verse?
Perhaps my pen should practice more, rehearse,
before the pond'rous thoughts my dreams immerse.
To rest my pen when hearing lover's call
her smiling face that muses to my all
even my words are hers to beck and call.
A poet seeks the ways of old romance,
and writes of love while courting new romance,
inviting her to join the tribade dance.
