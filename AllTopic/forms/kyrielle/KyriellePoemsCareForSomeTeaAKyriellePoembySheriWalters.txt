If you are smart, you will listen to me
Remember not all tales are just make believe
Dragons in snuggies are not just seen on TV
Never say yes when a dragon invites you to tea
I don't know how I got there, I hadn't a clue
But the next thing I heard was one lump or two
And he smiled most wide with his eyes all agleam
Never say yes when a dragon invites you to tea
His teeth were all pointy, as long as my shoe
And with a smile like that, who was I to refuse
So I smiled as I stammered 'can I have three? '
Never say yes when a dragon invites you to tea
If you are smart, you will listen to me
Never say yes when a dragon invites you to tea
