Though all seems wrong within your life
And the light seems soon to depart
And though pain may cut like a knife
Trust in the Lord with all your heart
Don’t fear deceitful winds of change
Or think of those whom you’re apart
When it’s steep on that mountain range
Trust in the Lord with all your heart
Does He not feed birds of the air?
Or clothes to the lilies impart?
How much more does He care for you?
Trust in the Lord with all your heart
Though all seems wrong within your life
Trust in the Lord with all your heart
