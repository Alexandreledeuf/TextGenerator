When anger plagues the heart it seems
The words we say hurt so much more.
Tempers may fly, break at the seams,
As we try to even the score.
When anger plagues the heart it seems
We forget the good times we had.
We dump the joys, the hopes, and dreams,
And just magnify all the bad.
When anger plagues the heart it seems
We tend to inflict useless pain.
But after the fight, some light beams
Just like the sun shines after rain.
