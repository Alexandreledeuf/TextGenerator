Rich or poor men have one Maker
And varied though their journeys be,
Each one may find sun or rain there
To grace the paths they walk daily.
Rich or poor men have one Maker
A destined end for low or great,
Through days of strife, tears and laughter,
The earthen soil, for them awaits.
Rich or poor men have one Maker
Who weighs all words or deeds of men,
The good and bad all laid out bare
To meet their fate: hell or...heaven.
