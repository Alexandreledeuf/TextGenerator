In this our brief earthly journey
Men face pain, conflict, wars and strife.
We won't find peace until we see
Christ is the Way,the Truth,the Life.
Greed and envy, lust for power,
Hate that cuts and kills like a knife.
We failed to learn our lessons here-
Christ is the Way,the Truth,the Life.
This world faces self-destruction,
For in Man's heart, Darkness is rife.
God sent His final Solution-
Christ is the Way,the Truth, the Life.
