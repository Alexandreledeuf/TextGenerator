There are good days and some bad days
Life brings troubles gives us bad cards
But God in the end sees us through
Life gets hard and some lose their home
Times changing and sometimes go bad
Money's tight and no place to roam
Some lose jobs and they become sad
Life gets hard and some lose their home
Folks lose their health peace and sleep
Prices rise so high and jobs get low
Some need their home to live and keep
Life gets hard and some lose their home.
