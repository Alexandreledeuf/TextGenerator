Don't know where I'd be without Him
He spreads forgiveness, leaves never
Send us blessings that's clear to see
He gives Love this day, forever
He always sees through hearts and all
through everything can go with Him
With God I can rise and stand tall
He gives Love this day, forever
Without His grace, love, where I'd be
His Divine love for us just flows
He always wants the best for me
He gives Love this day, forever.
