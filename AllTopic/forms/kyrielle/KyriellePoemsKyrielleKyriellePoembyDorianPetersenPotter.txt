That's not hard at all when done fine
This French style you can do right

Eight syllables per line in all
In each one you observe this call
There's rhyming all through to delight
Kyrielle is easy to write
Repeat the B in last line verse
You'll make a nice piece to diverse
Style to enjoy day or nite
Kyrielle is easy to write.
