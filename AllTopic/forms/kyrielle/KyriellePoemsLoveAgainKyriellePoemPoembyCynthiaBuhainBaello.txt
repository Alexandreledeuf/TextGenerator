Sometimes Life gives a crushing blow
That leaves one numbed from all the pain.
Thoughts are swayed to stay or go -
Whether to find new love again.
Lessons are marked and truly deep
Thoughts remind of love forsaken.
Fears may bar new paths to keep -
Whether to find new love again.
But like the new day, Hope rises,
It may not be true for all men,
Someone may come, the choice changes -
Whether to find new love again.
