The grace of God is free, it's true
But cost our LORD'S great sacrifice,
A ransom paid for me and you
For no human good could suffice.
The grace of God is free, it's true
But we need true repentant hearts,
Clean vessels for grace to flow through
And contain the Love He imparts.
The grace of God is free, it's true
But true faith shows in obedience,
Our love's proven by what we do
If we really have God's Presence.
The grace of God is free, it's true,
It can't be a license to sin,
The Word guides us this whole life through
Those who obey enter heaven.

A kyrielle is made of quatrains that rhyme. Each stanza (that is a quatrain)
has a line that repeats, so a line from a previous stanza. That line usually (but does not necessarily have to)  be the last line in the stanza.
Each line in the poem has eight syllables. There is no limit to the number of stanzas. Usually there are three or more stanzas.  Any type of rhyme scheme can be used.
