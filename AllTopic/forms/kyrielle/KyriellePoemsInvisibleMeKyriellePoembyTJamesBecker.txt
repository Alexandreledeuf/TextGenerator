Invisible me / Suspicion
**
Shadowed existence in my mind
Is impossible to define
Build ideas that shouldn’t be
Invisible me you don’t see
Accusations loudly berate
Realization comes too late
Inconceivable thoughts won’t flee
Invisible me you don’t see
Suspicion soon grows then imparts
Leaving behind a bleeding heart
Contemptuous thoughts plant the seed
Invisible me you don’t see
As distrust grows on vines maligned
Creating doubts that intertwine
A romance end is guaranteed
Invisible me you don’t see
