For God's sake I don't understand you
I love you but you make me blue
You don't act like a 'True Sister'
You say one thing but act another
I notice all you do dear 'Friend'
And so many things just don't blend
See the proof in all that you gather
You say one thing but act another
Your whole behaviour is so sad
Situation to others look bad
You don't act like a 'True Sister'
You say one thing but act another
