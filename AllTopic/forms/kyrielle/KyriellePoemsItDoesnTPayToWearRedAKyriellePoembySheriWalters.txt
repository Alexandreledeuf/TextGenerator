No Matter what the Captain might say
When he urges you to take part of that fray
You are better off to remain in Sick Bay
It doesn't pay to wear red when your on an 'Away'
The Captain will encourage you to be a brave young man
But neglects to tell you they'll use you as prey
And it is so easy to fall to his charismatic command
It doesn't pay to wear red when your on an 'Away'
You might want to reconsider stepping through that door
And by now I know this may sound a little cliche
Just ask any-red wearing Ensign that has gone before
It doesn't pay to wear red when your on an 'Away'
No matter what the Captain might say
It doesn't pay to wear red when your on an 'Away'
