Genuine friendship is a treasure
Of far greater worth than pure gold,
Through passing years the bond endures
Time and distance can't turn it cold.
Genuine friendship is a treasure
Built in trust, affection, and care -
The utmost good it will assure
Through changing seasons, it is there.
Genuine friendship is a treasure
Makes life's journey so fulfilling,
It comforts us, in sorrows, cure -
Finding it is a rare blessing!
