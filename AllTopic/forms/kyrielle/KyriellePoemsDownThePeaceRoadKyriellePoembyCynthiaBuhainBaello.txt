Two can stand on parallel lines,
Unburdened by useless fighting
The people's good clearly defined,
Down the Peace road they'll be walking.
Offense always breeds due defense,
Goals are not gained by sheer cunning.
When men live in coexistence,
Down the Peace road they'll be walking.
Refusal to this is foul Hate,
Blinded,  can't see where it's going.
If leaders' pride they will negate
Down the Peace road they'll be walking.
