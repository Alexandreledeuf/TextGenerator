Where this old world does strike me down
I do now feel like a mere clown
but clear everything You do see.
Oh, my God, have mercy for me.
When my whole world does fall apart
You do know all things in my heart:
I cannot beg for charity.
Oh, my God, have mercy for me.
In my country there is unrest
fire that set mere men to the test
and men are full of iniquity.
Oh, my God, have mercy for me.
Against darkness I cannot win,
I want to confess all my sin:
my lot is from apostasy.
Oh, my God, have mercy for me.
When I appear before Your face
let my sin be without a trace.
You do set all the captives free.
Oh, my God, have mercy for me.
