The fiercest storms will test the strength
Of all that breathes, lives in nature,
The raging blows measure at length
If roots could grip and stay secure.
In life the seasons bring us storms
That test our wills to stand, endure-
Hard blows expose the human form
If roots could grip and stay secure.
All men like trees stand breathing life
Face the tests, deal with the future,
Bracing storms and so tried by strife
If roots could grip and stay secure.
