People are strange, of varied moods
Some have loads of unresolved past.
Careless words are misunderstood,
When sorry is said, forgive we must.
People are strange, of varied moods
Childhood scars and fears suffocate
Harmony in life and stifle the Good,
And Conflict grows until it's too late.
People are strange, of varied moods
None are the same though they be twins,
Let's then show our love as we should
Strange we may be, everyone wins!
