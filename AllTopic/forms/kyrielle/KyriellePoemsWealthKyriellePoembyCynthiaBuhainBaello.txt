I had a friend so blessed with wealth,
Owned a house and vast properties,
She had one brother of poor health,
Brain damaged with lost memories.
I had a cousin blessed with wealth,
Loved money so much won't spend it,
Held it like ice cream, watched it melt-
And the joy of life he'd forfeit.
I had an aunt so blessed with wealth,
Her heart was cold and uncaring.
Money seemed to numb all she felt,
It prevented her from loving.
I may not be quite blessed with wealth
But God gave me more than just things.
Through all my joys and tears He held
This life - I'm thankful for living.
