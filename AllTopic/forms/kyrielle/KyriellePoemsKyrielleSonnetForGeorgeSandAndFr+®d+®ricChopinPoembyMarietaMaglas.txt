Searching for their love ideal
To plant there a dawn so real,
God gave them hope to go ahead
And palm flowers for their dream bed.
In their naked room without windows,
Not touched by the innuendos,
Music was their way to be wed
And palm flowers had their dream bed,
The cradle of their nascent thought
Could cut their main Gordian knot-
Baptism of freedom in the head.
Then, palm flowers had their dream bed.
Searching for their love ideal
And palm flowers for their dream bed.
