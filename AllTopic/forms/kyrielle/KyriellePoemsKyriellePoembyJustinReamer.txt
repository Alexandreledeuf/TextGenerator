Kyrielle, your eyes are so blue,
For they have a wonderful hue,
They are a beautiful shade,
For you are my fair maid.
Your hair, long and blond, astonishes me so,
For your love is the thing I know,
And, yea, it shall not fade,
For you are my fair maid.
You fill me with compassion,
Something beyond retroaction,
And, my, have you been finely made,
For you are my fair maid.
You hair shines in the sunlight,
For you teach the torches to burn bright;
I love your hair in a braid,
For you are my fair maid.
Your smile as white as day,
Makes me feel so gay,
For this with love you are paid,
For you are my fair maid.
Your compassion strikes my heart,
Which struck me from the very start,
And here we have stayed,
For you are my fair maid.
This one thing I know,
For it is quite so,
Of me you'll never raid,
For you are my fair maid.
