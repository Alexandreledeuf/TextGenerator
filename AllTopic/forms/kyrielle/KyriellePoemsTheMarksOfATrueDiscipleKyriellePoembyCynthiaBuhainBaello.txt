If we hold on to His teaching,
Remain in Christ and stay humble,
By His Word we will be showing
The marks of a true disciple.
If we do love one another
And this love is seen by people,
They'll know we bear as followers
The marks of a true disciple.
As branches live with the true Vine,
Without Him we are not able
To bear fruit which truly define
The marks of a true disciple.
To the world as we testify
Who God is and share the Gospel,
His Seed is sown and multiply
The marks of a true disciple.
