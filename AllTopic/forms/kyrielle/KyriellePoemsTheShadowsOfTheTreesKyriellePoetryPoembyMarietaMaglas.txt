Ships at the horizon look black-white in the game
Wet rocks through the crisp air reflect the sunset light.
The sky painted in mauve spreads foamy clouds in flame
The shadows of the trees remain forever white.
In searching for the sea, which is so far away,
And running over rocks, the river holds the night.
The man is standing guard in waiting for the day
The shadows of the trees remain forever white.
Behind the horizon, the sun is red like Mars.
The moon embraces life, which looks like anthracite.
The ancient years of light are coming from the stars
The shadows of the trees remain forever white.
Some crackling, popping sounds are coming from a fire
Sparkles shine in the deep pitch black sky of the night.
The man makes his woman burn with true desire
The shadows of the trees remain forever white.
A river full of feelings flows in their embrace
Illuminates their souls to reach the divine height.
Lovers swim in their sea of happiness with grace
The shadows of the trees remain forever white.
Confusions, fears, knowledge, courage, and wisdom are
The threads of the couple in weaving thoughts to fight.
The image of the town seems to rock very far
The shadows of the trees remain forever white.
Out of this world of madness, searching for the day,
Never finding their way back in the lost moonlight,
Letting their mind be free to reach the milky way,
The shadows of the trees remain forever white.
