Alas! When winter left the world so bare,
with trees and plants denied of their welfare,
the birds begged God to change the sordid scene:
Spring sprung a surprise making landscape green!
God heard the prayers of all earthlings fast;
His heart with pity for them was soon cast;
The Maker could no longer stay so mean:
Spring sprung a surprise making landscape green!
Godâ€™s word returned the warmth and leaves in days,
with flowers, fruits birds, insects joining the race;
The earth got hope in form of verdure sheen;
Spring sprung a surprise making landscape green!
Alas! When winter left the world so bare,
Spring sprung a surprise making landscape green.
