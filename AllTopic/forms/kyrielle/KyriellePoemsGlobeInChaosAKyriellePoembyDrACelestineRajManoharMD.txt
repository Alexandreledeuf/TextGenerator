The righteous stay in immense gloom;
More evil minds are seen to bloom!
The modern world has gone more gay;
Usher a new earth, God, I pray.
More heinous crimes reach ears and eyes;
The innocent, victims of vice;
More souls from God have gone astray;
Usher a new earth, God, I pray.
The kinds of sins have grown galore;
The shame is less though hearts are sore;
More devils roam the world each day;
Usher a new earth, God, I pray.
A world of lucre has surfaced;
The young and old keep all amazed;
Yet, God is not their Light and way;
Usher a new earth, God, I pray.
More gadgets rule most fields these days;
More people walk with masked a face;
For sins, all men must surely pay;
Usher a new earth, God, I pray.
Ethics and morals seem all dead;
More children stay abused, misled;
Godâ€™s codes are broken every day;
Usher a new earth, God, I pray.
