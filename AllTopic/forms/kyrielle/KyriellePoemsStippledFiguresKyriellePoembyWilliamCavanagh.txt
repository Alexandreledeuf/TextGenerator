She stood inside the school couloir
Soft skin bronzed, I stood in awe
Beech-y blond hair did incite
A kiss lesser the lane’s lamplight
Flushed, my heart a frantic pace
Patty blushing her pleasant face
Perfumed redolence did invite
A kiss lesser the lane’s lamplight
Provocation within her eyes
Her gracious glimpse is my demise
Stippled figures in the snow; cite
A kiss lesser the lane’s lamplight
