In the dark of the night if you hear a keening
A most unsettling sound as if an owl were screeching
When the moon sets up high above the trees
You have heard the cry of the bean-sidhe
A ghastly sight dressed in sheets of white
Hair long and fair and eyes without sight
Wailing so loud it will make your heart flee
You have heard the cry of the bean-sidhe
Gliding through out the forest at night
Lamenting a song of an unfortuitous plight
She will not leave, no matter your plea
You have heard the cry of the bean-sidhe
In the dark of the night if you hear a keening
You have heard the cry of the bean-sidhe
