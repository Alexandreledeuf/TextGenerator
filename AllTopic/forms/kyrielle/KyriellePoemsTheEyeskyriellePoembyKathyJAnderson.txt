It all gets explained with two eyes,
All the reasons we give with words
Cannot fathom the depth nor highs,
The whys and passions so expressed.
Some are blue, some are green or brown,
They share so much, rest assured,
Having it all, yet still they frown
With whys and passions so expressed.
The look of you is more than shared,
It is a puzzle that's explained
When you see into pools of care,
The whys and passions so expressed.
