Upon Natures Bay, Lies A Tomb/ Underneath The Tree, Laid Its Crust! /
A Maiden Weeps, Her Hands So Cold/ For Her Suffering, Have Being So Cold! '
2ND QUATRAIN:
From Left To Right, She Sort For Joy/ Taking Chances With The Least Choice! / A Grace To Sooth; Her Pains Of Old/ For Her Suffering; Have Been So Cold! /
3RD QUATRAIN:
'And Oft She Path, The Lonely Trail/ With Hands Trembling, And Breath So Frail! / Her Gasping Breath, A Thousand Fold/ For Her Suffering; Have Been So Cold! '
