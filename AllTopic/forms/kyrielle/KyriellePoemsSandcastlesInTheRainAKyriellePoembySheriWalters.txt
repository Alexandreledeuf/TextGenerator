Child, one day you will understand
When the course of time eases the pain
Giving way to all life's earthly demands
Your tears will fade like sandcastles in the rain
When all your bitter sorrows depart
And all that remains is the shadow of pain
Love will be the memory you hold in your heart
Your tears will fade like sandcastles in the rain
Hopes and dreams of love will reign anew
Where those memories of pain had once lain
And once more your heart will shine true
Your tears will fade like sandcastles in the rain
Child, one day you will understand
Your tears will fade like sandcastles in the rain
