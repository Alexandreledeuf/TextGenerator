Life's filled with much joy much aching
Like weather, clouds, we go changing
Sometimes is great, often a mess
Boldly go where dreams just take us.
Days passes us so quickly by
Making the best we laugh and cry
No hellos, goodbyes, just left to guess
Boldly go where dreams just take us.
So much take place, things of all kind
Some things are better left behind
Good or bad then why make a fuss
Boldly go where dreams just take us.
