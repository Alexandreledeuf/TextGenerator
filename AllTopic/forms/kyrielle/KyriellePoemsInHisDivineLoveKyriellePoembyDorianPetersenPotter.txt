His presence feel each night and day
I know He's never far away
When in trouble He hears my plight
I love the Lord with all my might
Read His messages of love, hear his call
He lifts me up each time I fall
Never leaves me out of His sight
I love the Lord with all my might
When think of Him heart wants to sing
Because He's my Savior and King
His love forever shines so bright
I love the Lord with all my might.
