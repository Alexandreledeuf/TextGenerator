I need to demonstrate a skill.
None of my poems fit the bill.
I'll write a new one.  What the hell.
I need another kyrielle.
I must not mention politics
Or religion.  I'm in a fix.
A sonnet - that's all very well.
I need another kyrielle
I can't go on about my weight,
Be negative, or full of hate.
Won't settle for a villanelle.
I need another kyrielle.
I mustn't moan about the shrinks,
Or point out that the "system" stinks.
The truth remains, but I won't tell.
Just need another kyrielle.
Won't criticise my CPN.
Oh dear, I must put down my pen.
Must write a new one.  What the hell.
I need another kyrielle.
