Is there a God under the root
Or yourself the God up on earth
How you shine like a fire so brute
Tell me how this bright with all mirth
Oh Gulmohar is there a route
Of Ganga for you under earth
Or you grow of a heavenly shoot
Tell me how this bright with all mirth
Crimson..scarlet..in all red suit
And in sunny yellow you're worth
An embrace, a big hug's pursuit
Tell me how this bright with all mirth
Is there a God under the root
Tell me how this bright with all mirth
