No doubt Jesus is my best friend
His love is never rude or dim
Hope and peace to my soul He sends
In everything I can count on Him
When people around let me down
Heart sings Him a worshiping hymn
In Him best of the best I've found
In everything I can count on Him
Without Him don't know where I'd be
He fills my life's cup to the brim
Sends me blessings that's clear to see
In everything I can count on Him.
