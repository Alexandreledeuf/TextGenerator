Oh, lovely Neptune's child
Your bright and winsome smile
Has tamed this heart so very wild
Please say you'll come and stay awhile
Beauty in every sun-kissed tress
I am lost to your every wile
This love for you I must confess
Please say you'll come and stay awhile
The truth of this I shall glean
For it is my very soul you guile
In this timorous madman's dream
Please say you'll come and stay awhile
Oh, lovely Neptune's child
Please say you'll come and stay awhile
