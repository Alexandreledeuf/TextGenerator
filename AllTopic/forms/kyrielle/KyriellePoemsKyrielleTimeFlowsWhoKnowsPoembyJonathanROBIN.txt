Life's sorrows, strife, or joys serene,
depend on chance - perspective seen
half full, half empty, who'll disclose:
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes?
Though urban smog clogs, pastures green
await fate's call, what might have been
may still become before dumb close:
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes?
Whence spring trade winds, here warm, there keen,
here hope for scope, there snare unseen,
what rules rich pride, switch onward blows
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes?
Here hope for scope, there narrow, mean,
which envies dreams' sweet seventeen,
when mortal harvests what he sows
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes?
Some take advantage, some pride preen,
take much for granted, some vent spleen,
then end bare pickings for the crows.
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes?
Some help their neighbours, some demean
through envy, spite, fears foul, unclean,
mental mosaics merge, life shows
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes?
Beyond black hole what soul may glean
insight not superficial sheen,
life justified despite knocks, blows.
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes?
The need for creeds seems vain smokescreen
to smooth fears which fast years can't screen,
the clock winds down till last repose,
Time flows, who knows truth when life goes?
