A girl-child walks along railroad;
Someone has hurt her feelings much;
Her mind is anguished by some word;
She needs a fairy-mother’s touch!
She’s unaware of dangers nigh;
No one can know her hurt as such!
May be, she thought she ought to die;
She needs a fairy-mother’s touch!
In innocence, she treads this way;
Her mother loves her very much;
Her mom had spoken tough that day;
She needs a fairy-mother’s touch!
A girl-child walks along railroad;
She needs a fairy-mother’s touch!
