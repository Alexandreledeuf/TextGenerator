I'll kick the cat then stir the fish,
drink stale,  cold coffee from a dish.
I'll rise at noon,  that's my new dawn.
I find my mornings so forlorn.
Get dressed. No shower, no shampoo.
Another day to muddle through.
A crumpled skirt, a blouse that's torn.
I find my mornings so forlorn.
I think I should have stayed in bed,
my purple feathered hat looks dead,
my army coat is bald and worn.
I find my mornings so forlorn.
I'll kick the cat then stir the fish,
I find my mornings so forlorn.
