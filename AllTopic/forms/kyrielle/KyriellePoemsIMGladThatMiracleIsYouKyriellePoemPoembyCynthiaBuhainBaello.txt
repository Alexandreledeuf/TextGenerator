Fate blessed me with a second chance,
Erased the anguish I've been through.
But miracles may come just once,
I'm glad that miracle is you.
The heart learns its coldness in time
When so burdened by pain it's true.
Love's miracle wrote a new rhyme,
I'm glad that miracle is you.
Knowing this gives me hope once more
This life is not all sad and blue,
Rainbows have miracles in store
I'm glad that miracle is you.
