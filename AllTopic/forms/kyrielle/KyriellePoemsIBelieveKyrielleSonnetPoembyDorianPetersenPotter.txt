There's hope for new day tomorrow.
Don't give to hurt with God be fine.
I believe we reap what we sow.
Just live life right walk straight the line.
My eyes shed many tears and such.
But refuse remain in the rain.
With God I can break all my chains.
Just live life right walk straight the line.
Believe things don't happen in vain.
Keep eyes open never walk blind.
Joy in the Lord just eases pain.
Just live life right walk straight the line.
There's hope for new day tomorrow.
Just live life right walk straight the line.
