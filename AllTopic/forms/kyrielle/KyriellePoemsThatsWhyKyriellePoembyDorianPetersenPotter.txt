Your attitude is really bad
and you are indeed not my friend
You're not to me at all that's sad
That's why chosen to keep away
For long I thought you a true friend
all can do is for you to pray
My heart needs time to heal and mend
That's why chosen to keep away
But got Jesus, He makes heart sing
Can't help to love and care a lot
But wearing mask is not my thing
That's why chosen to keep away
I don't want to get hurt anymore
you do your thing and thats your right
but don't like your game I close door
That's why chosen to keep away.
