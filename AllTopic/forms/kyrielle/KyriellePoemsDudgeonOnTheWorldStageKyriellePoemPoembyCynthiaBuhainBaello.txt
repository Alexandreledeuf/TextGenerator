Dudgeon on the world stage
Is like a child having tantrums-
Giving vent to anger and rage,
To its misery he succumbs.
Dudgeon on the world stage:
Like a dragon from the abyss,
Spits out flaming hate and outrage,
It always ends with loss of peace.
Dudgeon on the world stage
Has been there for years existing.
Borne from ire, virulence and umbrage
It needs no reason for being.
Dudgeon on the world stage,
Like the villain full of deceit,
The idiot who loves to engage
In conflicts where his end, he meets.
