When I was young and in my prime
I was just an ugly duckling.
I'd stay at home and spend my time
With poetry and my sewing.
Hours were gold in this noble craft
I found joy in creating something,
No parties for me, I thrived enough
With poetry and my sewing.
No late night's drain, my health was good
I got bored with all the dancing,
This wall flower bloomed as I should
With poetry and my sewing.
