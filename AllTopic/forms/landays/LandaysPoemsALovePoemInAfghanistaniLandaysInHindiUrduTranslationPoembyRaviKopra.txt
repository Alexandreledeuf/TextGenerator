laDki:
jab tu ne muje chooma, chuk maar diya tum ne
kya kahey gi meri maaN ab muje?
laDka:
kehna jab paani lainay gayi thee
gir gayi thee dariya k kinaray
laDki:
tera ghaDa nahin toota, kahy gi maaN
to fir kyon khoon beh hai teray hotoN pe?
laDka:
fir ye kehna apni maaN ko:
ghada gira rait pe, main giri pathar pe
laDki:
sub maaN k swaalon ka jwaab daitay ho, meray pyaaray
aao, bhar do ab mera moonh apni chumioN se!

Girl:
When you kissed me, you bit me,
What will my mother say?
Boy:
Give your mother this answer:
I went to fetch water and fell by the river.
Girl:
Your jug isn't broken, my mother will say,
so why is your bottom lip bleeding that way?
Boy:
Tell your mother this one:
My jug fell on clay, I fell on stone.
Girl:
You have all my mother's answers, sweet.
Now take my raw mouth — bon appétit!
