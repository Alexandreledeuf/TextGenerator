This piece of composition is in the praise of Barack Hussain Obama newly elected president of U.S.A.; the present time calls forth Barack Hussain Obama for greater courage and precision to face the challenges to fetch out humanity from the quagmire of confusion. It was my ardent desire that I should read out this piece of homage in front of the huge gathering on the occasion of his oath celebrations but for me it is merely a vain longing therefore I present it for general reading.
Barack Hussain Obama (An Acrostic Panegyric)
Black beauty agleam with beams,
Audacious advocate with capacious brain,
Relentful representative of the West,
Adroit, harbinger of good tidings,
Courageous, chivalrous and gallant from the heart,
Kindhearted, and compassionate to the grieved.
Harmonious in intents, thoughts and actions,
Undisguised, uniformed in outer and inner-self,
Scrupulous: seeks guidance from the celestial laws,
Saviour: he is to rescue the world out of the conflicts,
Auspicious whom history has sought for years,
Illuminated with the spirit to serve the downtrodden,
Nobility all wrapped, incarnated in human grandeur.
Onerous captain deemed to steer the ship with
Beacons of hope through the region of confusions;
Astute orator, heals he cuts with the balm of words,
Meticulous, cautious he is in decision making,
Adorable equally in the West and in the East too.
Barack Hussain Obama
