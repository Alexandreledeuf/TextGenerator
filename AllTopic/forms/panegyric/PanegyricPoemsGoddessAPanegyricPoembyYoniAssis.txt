Goddess be thy name
Enchanting people, your game
You walk in beauty like the night
Leaving a trail of hearts in sight
Do you know your power?
Always sweet, never sour
The adoration must be heady
No mortal man could remain as steady
You are divine
The rest, bovine
You make your dress
Never a mess
You loved me once
I haven’t forgotten
I was your king
The rest, just rotten
What’s left, I ask?
The past to bask?
Maybe just a dream?
I remember every scene!
Stupid, hapless romantic
How old is your shtick?
Pining is so yesterday
About time for a holiday
A goddess you are
Yet here I’m the star
It’s become about me
That’s the way it should be
