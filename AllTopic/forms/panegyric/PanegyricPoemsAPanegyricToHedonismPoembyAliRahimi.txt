Alcohol is the queen
Tobacco is her consort
So we can still die
We'll still be able to die
After delectable hours
Spent in the bars
Yes we wallow in reckless surfeit
Here is no religion station
People, the very essence
Of vice incarnate
The pious fear to tread
This God-forsaken place
But the binge is going on
Also hash, dead can dance or
Maybe Bob Marley and the Wailers
And American dollars
What else do you fancy?
For your euphoric felicity? !
