panegyric
Not a truth in the beginning
Not a truth in the ending!
Truth hides in suffocation,
As we are on the work,
Truth is not there.
Truth lies beneath actions.
Bitterness brings happiness
Night inaugurates lights in
The presence of darkness.
Dream begets strangerness
Likewise, sun making pearls of
Light in the heart of nights
Truths lie there though not truth!
I wonder and hate,
I envision and muse not;
Lies and truths mingle together
Likewise, I exist!
