Dayton
he lived in a city
made of elevators
and dead end alleyways
all was a box or trap
even the kids knew life
by its fistfights and strays
cats and dogs chased across
the corporation map
his first kiss was a lie
but one that was pretty
his teenage love affairs
flew through him in a snap
leaving him with gritty
women and one-act plays
