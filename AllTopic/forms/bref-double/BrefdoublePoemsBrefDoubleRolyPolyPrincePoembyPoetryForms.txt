Roly-Poly Prince
Her older sister dared her to
pick up the armored crawly bug
and hold it in her tiny hand.
The small girl carefully complied.
Her frown turned up into a smile
of glee as her confidence grew
changing her face into the glow
of a delighted elfin bride.
Wet and slick from the grassy dew
the round insect rolled right up tight,
defense to fend off foe, a new
magic prince for her fairy land!
The impish buck toothed tot at two
had bravely taken up command.
