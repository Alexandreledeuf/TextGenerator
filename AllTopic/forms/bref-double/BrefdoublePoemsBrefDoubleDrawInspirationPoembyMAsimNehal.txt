Listen to your heart,
Follow your dreams,
Don't look for anything else,
Just forget unnecessary things.
Live Life to its fullest,
And enjoy every minute of it.
Bend the rules and push the limits
Love all, but trust only ONE.
Health is your real wealth,
believing others is foolishness
Just enjoy what you have with God's bless
Waiting for wealth will create a mess.
Live for as long as you can.
Settle for nothing but only the best,
And give cent percent with sincerity and trust.
Sometimes, take risk and live on the edges.
You are the master of your fate
You are the captain of your ship.
