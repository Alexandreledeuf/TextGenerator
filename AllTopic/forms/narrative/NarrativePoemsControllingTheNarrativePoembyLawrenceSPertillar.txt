How do you intend to deliver your speech?
With it done uninterrupted,
And attention given to you successfully?
Aren't you expecting to offend,
Those who attend every meeting...
Asking questions you have answered in the past?
Before you had taken positions,
To not have them heard or understood.
You know everyone comes,
With it wished to make their suggestions.
How do you suppose this time will be different?
What makes you believe this speech will be effective?
'I am going to videotape those decisions I've made.
And what will be done to take place.
Those who oppose will find 'something' as always,
To prevent a moving forward...
With their mouths open to initiate conflict.'
But that step you take,
Will be considered as controlling the narrative.
And many will object to your impersonal approach.
'And...
Is there a point you'd like to make?
Impersonal, personal to offend or not...
I have decided we will move forward.
Without listening to hear,
What was done in the past...
That has left all of us complaining,
What to do, how to do it and 'who' is reluctant...
To offend those seeking acceptance and approval.'
What if some leave the meeting,
More disgusted than they normally do...
To say nothing about their future is being done?
'That future will come to go.
And they still will show their disgust,
Because someone had the guts to move forward.'
