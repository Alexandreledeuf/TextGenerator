Oily, gleaming mirrors on tarmac,
Tyres causing greasy bubbles,
Birds dancing in natures baths,
Trees stretching out to catch the moisture,
Rainbow of umbrellas bobbing along,
Puddles ready for the children,
Not made though for the mums,
Cyclists despising every moment,
Raindrops racing down the window,
Internally betting which one will win,
Protected in my warm cocoon,
Indulging in the creature comforts,
I don't do drowned rat very well,
I will stay in this heavenly sanctuary,
Enjoying the narrative of the rain
