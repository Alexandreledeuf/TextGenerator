Unchanged is the narrative.
Unchanged and limited,
As if restricted to go beyond...
To make attempts to expand the mind,
In an enhancement to advance...
From what is repetitious.
Decaying yet not considered,
Overstating a worthlessness.
But kept to value for the purpose,
Of knowing a dead horse to beat it...
Gives many comfort to repeat this activity,
Over and over again.
With it done to feel good about themselves.
And rely upon receiving immediate validation.
