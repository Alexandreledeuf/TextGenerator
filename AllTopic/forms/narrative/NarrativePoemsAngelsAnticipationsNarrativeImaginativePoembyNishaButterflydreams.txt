Alone, under clouded skies and darkness;
An angel awaits her knight in gloom,
Her cloak of white laced, tinsels sparkle;
To the silvery outlined puffed up moon.
Her delicate wings of satins finest silk;
Displayed like white winter plumage,
Her curled and lengthy golden locks;
Floats across her wandering visage.
She’s waiting for her lovers return;
He fights the mighty demons of lucifer,
Her lips are pouted pink in prayer;
For her loves safe guidance at war.
This beautiful angel is me, your Juliet;
The handsome knight is you, Romeo,
Return safely, it is only for you that I fret;
My love on you, forever I’ll bestow.
