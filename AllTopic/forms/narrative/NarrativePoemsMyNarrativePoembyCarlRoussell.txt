Parts of a narrative will
define, combine, confine.
Thematic developments will
confuse, abuse, refuse.
Now write and rewrite the words,
find the rhyme and reason
defining and redefining
an intricate plot.
The words and the sentences,
paragraphs and chapters,
the pages and the covers,
all parts of the narrative.
A voice from a tale
you're surprised to find
few will want to hear,
so put the book down.
I've tried to write and rewrite,
to find the poetry,
to characterize the causes of
the present state I'm in.
The words and the sentences,
paragraphs and chapters,
the pages and the binding,
all parts of my narrative.
So ends the story,
the feelings felt,
the words have failed.
Put the book down.
