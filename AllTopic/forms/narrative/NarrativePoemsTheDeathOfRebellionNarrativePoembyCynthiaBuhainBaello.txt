She was a sweet young girl
The apple of her father's eyes
Her long hair blessed with curls
She was adored by all the guys.
Her father tried to set rules
His attempts at discipline,
To guide her from home to school
And to watch where she had been.
But the young Miss felt quite fenced
And rebelled like all young people,
With repeated lies and offense
She made her father miserable.
Now the young woman had a boyfriend
A fellow classmate with whom she went,
The young man she'd always defend
When with rules her father was bent.
One day without his knowledge,
The young sweethearts went for a date.
The days searching left him on edge,
When they found her, it was rather too late.
Any father will melt at the horror
Of finding his daughter so dead,
Twenty stab wounds from her young lover
Whose drug-crazed mind was addicted.
Yes the father loved her so much
But his child was warped in rebellion.
He could only grieve and watch
As she swallowed her own destruction.
'A fool spurns his father's discipline, but whoever heeds correction
shows prudence.'
Proverbs 15: 5
