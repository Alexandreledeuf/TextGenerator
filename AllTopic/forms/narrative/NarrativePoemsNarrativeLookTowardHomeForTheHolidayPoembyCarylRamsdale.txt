Everyone’s talking of brave warriors—
Like you and the place where you’re assigned.
They say you’re inspired—stand for love
Devoted to country and mankind.
You don’t leave my mind day or nighttime,
Belong to me even in my dreams;
I’m either praying or reliving us
In one way or another it seems.
Sometimes I see your lonesome shadow
Framed by the horizon’s afterglow;
You’re quite worthy of imitation
As the loyal peacekeeper I know.
Tonight I placed a praying angel
Near a flaming Christmas candlelight;
On the windowsill, to light your way,
To the place your heart lives ev’ry night.
I’m missing you more—and it’s Christmas,
So I’ve decked the halls ev’ry which way;
With our favorite decorations
Just like you’re here—for the holiday.
I pushed an enormous Yule log
Into the fireplace for you to light;
Together we could warm ourselves there
As our Christmas hearth glows jewel bright.
You’ll be seeing our Christmas at home
If you’re here or still miles away;
My present of the heart’s this picture
Just look toward home for the holiday.
