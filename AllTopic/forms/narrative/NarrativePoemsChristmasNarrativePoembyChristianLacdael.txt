As the festive season draws near,
There is excitement in the air,
Spurring a welcome sense of cheer,
Which both adults and children share,
There's hopes a snowfall will occur,
And you see loved ones as planned for,
Surplus from the harvests there were,
Means that there is a feast in store,
As soon as advent has begun,
Days can't pass fast enough for some,
Light candles till the wait is done,
And the awaited shall soon come,
Good will to those that have it tough,
As Christmas spirit grows in us,
To be with loved ones is enough,
There is no need for too much fuss,
Make sure preparations are laid,
And you have stocked full the cupboard,
While mixing pudding to be made,
Voice wishes you hope get answered,
Claim the best fir tree there's to find,
Which shan't go up before it should,
Keep the superstition in mind,
Wait till Christmas Eve if you could,
Dress the house up with evergreen,
Those plants in which spirits remain,
They promise a spring shall be seen,
Cold and darkness won't always reign,
The tree we take care to adorn,
Shades gifts we're eager to open,
As they cannot wait until dawn,
Glee is seen in eyes of children,
Since there is no evil about,
On Christmas Eve people unite,
Signalled by church bells ringing out,
There is praise given at midnight,
Faithful kneel to see out advent,
It's said creatures too do this act,
Till sunup time's restlessly spent,
As promises of joy distract,
Soon after children stir they wake,
And to the Christmas tree they sneak,
While careful of the noise they make,
At their presents they hope to peek,
That in which Kris Kringle partook,
Spurs us to give and receive back,
Warmed by a sincere thankful look,
Which on Christmas morning few lack,
Only brief moments are tranquil,
Till kitchens have goods to reveal,
With rich foods to give us our fill,
All gather for the family meal,
The pudding is the most special,
Because it's used to fortune tell,
Silver hidden in a morsel,
Means in the new year you'll do well,
Each festive day should be joyous,
So keep decorations in place,
Up till the twelfth day of Christmas,
Else there will be bad luck to face,
The season has come to a close,
It's one others cannot surpass,
Saddened when the festive cheer goes,
For till there's more a year must pass.
