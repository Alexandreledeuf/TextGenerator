Listen my children and you shall hear,
The life story of Taylor Swift loud and clear.
How she touched the hearts of many,
With her amazing songs plenty.
She was born and raised in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania land.
She wrote songs when she felt her social life was offhand.
Taylor always had trouble fitting in.
She always got knocked down like a social bowling pin.
A computer repairman taught her the guitar to play.
He taught her only three chords and she learned the rest someway.
Now she has 6 albums,66 songs, and 10 hit singles.
This breath-taking celebrity came from a timid girl who mingled.
She has had many songs that topped charts.
Her songs are always written straight from her heart.
Her first song was written when she was thirteen.
Taylor wrote songs when she needed to come clean.
Taylor Swift writes her songs about her personal life.
About break-ups, make-ups, and love strive.
"My goal is to never write songs that my fans can't relate to"
Just about every girl feels one or two of her songs that tell their story true.
In 2009, Taylor won the Best Music Video CMA award.
She was so excited and adored.
But then Kanye West ran up and took the microphone
And the event of how he protested that she didn't deserve it is well known
She is very humorous and comical
She is more average and normal,
Than some may think she is.
She's just a teenager trying to have fun and fit in like the rest of us.
Taylor doesn't have a "Love Story".
She also has "Beautiful Eyes"
She knows that she's "â€¦not a princess. This ain't a fairy tale"
She knows when to "Jump than fall".
