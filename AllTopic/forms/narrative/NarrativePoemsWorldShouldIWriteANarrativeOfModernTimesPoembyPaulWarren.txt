Should I write a narrative of the modern times
If I am able to get it clear in my mind
When the news of the day is near
The truth of it all may not be clear
There are villains for us all to see
And heroes that will for some come to be
The search for truth is the aim in it all
Read it digest it and in in the end make your call.
