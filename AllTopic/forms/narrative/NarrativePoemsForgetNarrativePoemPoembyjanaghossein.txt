My mom went to the beach
but she forgot her things
to the back of the car she reached
but still she forgot everything
she asked like a million times where are my things
and then she remembered she forgot them at home
then she called twice and told me: are my things at home
i said yes
and she went mad
she went and swam and when she came back
i saw her wet
i asked her: what did you do
she said its okay i swam in my clothes
and then i laughed until i died
but all she did was shout and fight
and then i got in trouble
for all the mess i had done
goodbye sunshine because i am grounded
for like a week
see you my friends
but maybe till the end
