When'll they stop preaching about "dieing for this country"
& start preaching about LIVING FOR IT
Cause while they're still preaching
"we died for this country"
WE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE DIEING IN IT
While they're are still preaching"We died for this country "
They're failing to realise that
as honourable freedom fighters
Their greater purpose was fulfilled on the liberational front
And they've no purpose at all
as ECONOMIC LIBERATORS
So While they're still preaching "we died for this country"
They seem to forget that the war of liberation was fought FOR
and BY every unborn child
that INSPIRED perseverance among freedom fighters to fight for a better future
So
While they're still preaching"We died for this country"
They seem to forget that the war of liberation was fought by every
mother, brother, father, sister, child
who had to be burnt in a hut alive
While they're still preaching "we died for this country"
They seem to forget that the war of liberation
Was fought by
Every son, daughter, mother, father tortured on suspicions of harbouring freedom fighters
While they're still preaching "we died for this country "
They seem to forget that the war of liberation was fought by every village that clothed, feed and admitted no knowledge nor existence of the precise whereabouts of freedom fighters
So
While they're still preaching "we died for this country"
They seem to have forgotten that the war of liberation was a generational flame
Were names of departed freedom fighters were called for, asked for
in prayer, in dance, in songs
In rituals cleansing wages of vanity attempting to deter the desires of freedom enduring til the very end
So
While they're are still preaching we died for this country
They seem to have overlooked that war of liberation was fought by every spirit medium that tranced and invoke ancestry spirits to be the eyes and ears of the revolution
So
While they're are still preaching we died for this country
They seem to forget that the war of liberation was
Fought by every freedom fighter stuffed in massive Grave
and hasn't uttered a single word since
and is still yet to realise what they fought and died for
so
When'll they stop preaching about "dieing for this country"
And start accepting facts of truth so we too can come back home and live in it
Cause
While they're still preaching "we died for this country"
they're re failing to realise that
they're taking pride in dieing for a country that they themselves are now killing
