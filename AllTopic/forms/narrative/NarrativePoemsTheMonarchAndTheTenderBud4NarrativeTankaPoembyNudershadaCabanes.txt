It was a summer
So long ago, when you came
To pluck my blossom
I was just a tender bud
Blooming into a flower
You were a monarch
Hovering in the garden
Where I was growing
I was mesmerized by you
By your most colorful wings
I welcomed your touch
And your gentle caresses
On my soft petals
As you steal away my youth
And my innocence from me
In that long summer
I became a full flower
Blooming in your eyes
No longer a tender bud
Your love nourished me with warmth
