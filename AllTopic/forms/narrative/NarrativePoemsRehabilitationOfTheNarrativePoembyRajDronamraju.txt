Story before specifics
Biography before basics
This entertainment has become substance of talk
The fog of self-aggrandizement
The blurred lines of the myth as you
The parameters have bent from the heat of delusion
And I say delusion because the difference between narrative and self-introduction have muddled together
Have been lost in a torrent of brown rainwater filling the basin and overflowing
And they call this social media
And they call this your new smart TV
And they call this bootleg intellectual property easily available
When I was busted, the details were told in flat, spare language
Not a tall tale or dramatic monologue but merely my version of events
I hope we can save the story this way
I hope we can conserve the imagination, heal the imagination, and fill the heart with a sense of proportion and an unjaded joy in reading further
Put in its place - bought from a bookstore, checked out from a library, read in bed or on a beach or while sitting in a cafe
The fascination of the terminator who ends himself by inhabiting this badly told fiction
Dry anecdotes the fourth time round
Crack and break like seat covers on a two decades old car
