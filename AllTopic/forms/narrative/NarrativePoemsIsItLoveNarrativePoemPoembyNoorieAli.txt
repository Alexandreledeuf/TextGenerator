I'm in love
wow' the candles smoking up
wax is diripping making shapes like love hearts'
I guess now this is where the journey starts
where there is a girl a boy
lighting bulbs, whith lowering elecryfying currents
his dark caramel eyes, her white Cupid smile
I guess this is where we torch fireflies
making bonds like never before
tasting buds like forever, I won't let go
the mirrors on show, reflective on us both
artists, paint images while, poets they write
how nice, written romance so full of ice coloured in colours like so red, so black & white
hovering heats at the same time she's quietly discreet
exchanging vowel underneath the soft palm trees
I guess now this is where the journey follows -
a man, a woman  swinging on sparrows making love nests
bound in love like flying turtle duves
she kisses his breath, what a sweet hallow
chained to her, is her beloved arrow which points to he'
her eyes they dim, they sway, crying to the bounty of Ray
deep inside he hides inside those eyes that won't complain
like the train of compassion departed today'
he' be like a prisoner in her arms
controlled by her he'd drown beneath flowers
on and on he'd stay there for hours
like luminous petals of hope and tender.
