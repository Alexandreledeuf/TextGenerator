Narrative of Love
I do not know what is love But what you are
More than love for me my dear sweetheart
Your very presence is like real love don't debar
God has carved you with love an eternal art
Let me narrate your fragrance and essence
You dangle and dance but just all around me
You have taken over all my mind and sense
My love is a canoe your beauty is green sea
Why not to take pleasure being in love chain
Why not to transfer taste and flavor just across
Let us play hide and seek in cold dazzling rain
Let us win the moment, let us forget about loss
