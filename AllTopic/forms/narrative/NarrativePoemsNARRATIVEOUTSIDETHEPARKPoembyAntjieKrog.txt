Susara Domroch of Kubus
‘well I'll vote for Grandpa Mandela
why is it that you're someone these days if you're Nama?
because we're now our own word
under the old governments we were their word
for many years we were driven to the barren places
Coloured Reserves
we were nothing
but today we're something
and it's him, that Granddad Mandela, it's him
no, Mandela's lot have got my vote'
the church in Kubus stands white against the quartzite sky
and echoes its voice among the ridges
‘o God blow and bloom your love for us'
says Uncle Adam
the congregation sing with their hands on their hearts
‘yes Jesus is a rock
in a thi-ir-sty land
a thi-ir-sty land
a thi-ir-sty land
you are like breath to me
Je-sus Je-ee-ee-sus'
Kubus hangs on the edge of Raisin Mountain
God it takes a lot to survive out here
Mrs Farmer of Eksteensfontein
‘I'm just very attached to cattle
a house isn't for me
but the open country
I grew up like this in the open country
in a little round house
when we came here it was raining
and the marigolds were growing high
when I squatted I sat under a floor of flowers
so I made a place of my own
that I still love
for the earth
for the country'
