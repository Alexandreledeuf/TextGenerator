In my country
Democracy has been tasted
And it is a bitter pill
Its tenets of freedom and liberty
Are grossly abused
And the dictum
Of one man one vote
A mockery of the fact
There is a transition
And elections stare
In the faces of citizens
But it appears
They will never see the ballot boxes
In which their franchise
Will be exercised
The road to the eight senate
Is murky and crooked
That prediction of perdition
Is becoming inevitable
And we are waiting.
