When he was born,
the stars collapsed,
No one rejoice,
Not even himself.
When he was 3,
The people cry,
If why they give,
Someone like this.
When he was 10,
He's left behind,
& no one cares,
Even if he dies.
When he turned teen,
He learned to live,
Live the life alone,
Coz no one cares.
The time have passed,
No companion,
On his right side,
Even in the left.
He learned to survive,
Survive alone,
In his own way,
People loves him tight.
