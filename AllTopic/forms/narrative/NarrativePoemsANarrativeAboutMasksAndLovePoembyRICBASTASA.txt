somehow the mask has become my own face
you lift it up with your hands and there are no more stories
to be told: about love? there is none anymore, if you insist,
there might be one, but it was about the love that did not die,
and for which i have told you once, and for me to live some more
years, as i insist, i wore a mask full of love and laced with
lust, and then i met you and you say
i am beautiful.
you say you love me, and i fall on an abyss of silence,
and i keep on falling, and i should have told you about
a story that i keep on telling but which you have not heard,
some twists, a clinch, a pinch, an inch of truth
that could have reached you,
but you do not want to listen anymore,
this is a love story,
but at the scene when you begin to unrobe me,
i tell you the truth,
this is not about you and I,
this is still about my past,
about pain and sin,
how could you be so unkind?
