a beautiful narrative stalls,
is led to a stable of gold...
or it is a sugar loaf
for children at a rustic table
who break off pieces
to dip in blue bowls of
milk.
this reminds them of clouds like silk
contained in a blue sky
and the sugar loaf is bright,
sparkling like snow outside
or it is buttered gold as sunrise
the world without lies
dew beading on the leaves.
or all of these at the same time
in needlepoint.
it is a rose trellised hour.
the children are their Mama's best roses,
the heirlooms; this is how she thinks.
but the teller of tales must choose
which ruse to pursue
though the children want everything for Christmas
they were made for that
to go down every last jeweled road
singing their scraps of song
to swing on the swings in moonlight
too long
so that they grew cold
with no fortune told but the Star
so far
from Auntie Em in a crystal globe
pleading oh please return
return from a poppy bright sleep;
it should be Spring.
but the trees break out into weeping
instead of flowers...
