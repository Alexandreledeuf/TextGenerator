I was a child then
Living in a rural place
In close communion
With nature-the sea and sky
The earth, the trees and mountains
Nature surrounded
My existence as a child
A sight I beheld
Most constantly as I grew
In our little home sweet home
In those early years
Life was so simple, idyllic
So different from now
Everything seemed so perfect
To an innocent, young child
In a coastal town
Away from urbanity
Nature provided
Most of the needs, from basic
To a child's entertainment
The rain was a joy
When it came to visit and pour
It was the best time
To jump and swim in the sea
After school, on rainy days
The russet hued earth
Baked by the sun to hardness
Was a child's playground
Where my tender feet galloped
And run free during playtime
How beautiful 'twas
To have lived in such a way
In simplicity
Far from the noise and chaos
From the hub of city life
The water was drawn
From the rocky and deep wells
Dugged from rocky earth
By the old people in town
It nourished life in the coast
At night the moonlight
Seemed to glow brighter, mirrored
In the sleepy sea
Its sparkling beams danced and moved
In the gently lapping waves
Children play hide and seek
On moonlit nights, their laughter
Pealed like tiny bells
While I gazed at the moon's face
Admiring its radiant glow
I remember well
How father would go fishing
On most nights, alone
Riding a sturdy banca
And mother would wait at home
At dawn, when the moon
Had faded and sunrise came
The vast horizon
Glowed, dazzling with colors
Of burning fire, bright, reddish
The sun was amber
In the days of my childhood
Ever burning bright
Warm happy days in the sun
I will always remember
The nights of stargazing
When the sky was without moon
And of moonlit nights
As I listened to dreamy
Lullabies of the blue sea
Those were the best days
A time of my life that shaped
Who I am today
A time of blooming, growing
A time of learning to fly
So much memories
I had as a child growing
A season of life
When everything was simple
When love was not so complex
