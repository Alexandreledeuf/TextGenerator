I walk beside him
Scared to death.
I smile trying not to show it.
He smirks back.
He knows I’m faking,
he knows I want to turn and run.
Run as fast as I can home.
Home- oh I wish to see it again.
Oh dear mama,
I love you.
I don’t want to die.
I’m only 8.
It looks so high
I climb on, green faced,
Heart pounding
Over under, over under
Loopdy loop, dive.
It’s all over,
The roller coaster of death.
I put my feet on the ground,
glad to see it on my own terms.
I look up at him laughing,
“I did it, I won the dare! ” I say.
