The one thing that troubles,
Control freaks the most.
Is the narrative produced.
Limiting them to a comprehension.
Out of their domain to explain.
And not confirmed through channels of
gossip.
Nor hearsay.
He said, they said, she said to everyone,
Dated to collaborate after the fact info.
Since what has been dissected not to
spin,
Is proof of truth not to twist...
Into something that fits,
Appropriately in inappropriate times.
Or find a better way,
How truth should be delivered.
And by who.
When, where and to whom.
Just for pre-meditated sake,
That a getting to take the credit.
Sets the tone.
And the ones too dedicated to honesty.
Are not alone receiving the attention given.
