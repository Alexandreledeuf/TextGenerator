Author's note:
Logic: 101
Life suggests...some lies
....Are good some are bad
Attacking...these kids
......Is sad
If true in fact
They misbehaved....
Though in misbehaving
.....A life...is saved
Then why the hell
Folks rant and rave
.....When through......the lie
Another child 'tis saved
If indeed these kids are lying...
Yet saved...one life...their trying
....Simply means....some lies
Are good and some are bad
Attacking these students....
Is sad
