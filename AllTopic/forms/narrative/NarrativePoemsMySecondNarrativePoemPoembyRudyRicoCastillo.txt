There was a girl named Zelle,
Who always wanted to excel.
In every thing that she does,
it is accompanied with a must.
People hated Zelle in simple ways
Through her willingness to have a base.
A base where she will be happy.
A base where she will excel.
Patience is a virtue,
that's what they say.
Willingness is also a virtue,
that's for me to say.
Zelle worked hard to find her goal.
Exert countless effort and made it bold.
Through heart-break things that she do,
People loves her tight.
