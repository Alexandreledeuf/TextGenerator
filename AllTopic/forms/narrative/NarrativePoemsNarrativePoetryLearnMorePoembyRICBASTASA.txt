different?
Though
his earliest poems
are
formal and satirical,
he quickly adopted
the new forms
of Brazilian modernism
that were evolving
in the 1920s,
incited by the work
of MÃ¡rio de Andrade
(to whom he was not related) .
He adopted a
Whitmanian free verse,
mingling speech fluent
in elegance and truth
about the
surrounding,
a few improvements
many times
quotidian,
world,
with a fluidity of thought.

Notice something
We've made.
are you jealous?
sorry,
i am not telling
you
that i am writing this one,
i am not telling
you
that i write for you
or myself,
sometimes, i challenge
the hypocrisy
of the poets
who feel the way
you do:
hubris!
