I delve beneath the news
To probe underlying views
I believe inform perspectives
So immersed in adjectives
They cloud messages
In swathes of bromide passages
Paraded as the Gospel truth
On television and in the social media booth
Where simpletons devour poppycock
They lap up around the clock
Repeating fallacies
They elevate to the level of delicacies
I rate beneath contempt
Regardless of the attempt
To disregard the immutability of fact
So long as the contract of tact
Leads news consumers
To graduate into verisimilitude subsumers
Capable of teasing fact from fiction
In an era when half truths fuel friction
Catalyzing misunderstandings
By ignoring veracity underpinnings and vilifying social standings.
