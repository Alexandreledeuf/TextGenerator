There was a well-known pastor
So effective in ministry
The congregation's favor
Blessed him well materially.
He preached so eloquently
And with his wife they served,
Their time spent in activity,
Recognition well-deserved.
They traveled to and fro
For sermons in all places
Their children left and so
Their son fell from God's graces.
They say most pastor's kids
End up in gross rebellion,
Without the care he needs
He fell into temptation.
The young man had a Miss,
With whom he spent most days,
Sin came with just one kiss
And desire came all the way.
While the couple never knew
The son and his affairs,
No matter what they do
Sin always shows her wares.
The young man's girl got pregnant
But they were to immigrate,
So the son chose in an instant
The 'problem' he'd terminate.
The couple said a miscarriage
Had taken the baby away,
But in church it drew a wedge
That clouded it to this day.
Couples active in ministry
Neglect to care for their children,
Out of touch with God's priority
Suffer loss of home in the end.
Like a house that's well constructed
Through the years of love and caring,
Families are God-connected
With lifetime nurturing.
Unless the Lord build the house
We will all build in vain,
His Words in us will arise -
Our dwelling will be free from pain.
'The Bible has a word for 'safe' sex: it's called marriage.'
