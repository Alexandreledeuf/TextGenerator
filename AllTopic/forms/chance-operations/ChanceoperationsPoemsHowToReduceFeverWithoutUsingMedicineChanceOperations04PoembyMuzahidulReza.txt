To avoid fever-reducing medications like acetaminophen
Or ibuprofen - or when you just don't have any handy -
You can try a non-medical approach to lowering your fever;

To cure the underlying illness or problem;

Your body fight off an infection;
But if a temperature climbs high enough
To make you really uncomfortable or dehydrated,
Lowering the fever can help;
Here are some methods to try:
Place a cool, damp washcloth on your forehead while resting,
Take a lukewarm tub bath or a sponge bath,
As the water evaporates from your skin,
It will cool you and bring you temperature down,
on't use cold water,
It can make you shiver and cause your body temperature to rise,
Likewise, don't use rubbing alcohol
It is an old-fashioned fever remedy;
It can cause a temperature spike
And possibly even alcohol poisoning;
Offer you plenty of fluids and chilled foods,
Such as ice pops and yogurt,
To help cool the body from the inside out and keep you hydrated;
Use a fan, Again, you don't want to be chilled,
Keep the fan at a low setting and have it circulate the air
Around you rather than blow directly on you;
Remove layers of clothing so you can lose heat
More easily through your skin,
Dress in one light layer,
If you are shivering, take a light blanket until you are warm again;
Stay indoors in a cool place,
Or, if you're outside, stay in the shade;
Call the doctor right away
