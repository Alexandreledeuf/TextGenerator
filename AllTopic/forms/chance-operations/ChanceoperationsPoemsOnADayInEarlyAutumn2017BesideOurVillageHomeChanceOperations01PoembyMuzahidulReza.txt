On a day in early autumn 2017, beside our village home
At noon,
In the grey-green field I stood
A photographer took some of my photographs,
Printing out soon
Gave me the one.
Leaves were not falling yet in my country
Fields were full of green-golden crops
Farmers were singing and gossiping while taking care of their crops;
White patched clouds seen around the sky
