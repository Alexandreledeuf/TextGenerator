just beyond
sunset’s burst of color
a glimpse of promise
so far between wishes
and fulfillment
the sun has reason
to celebrate day’s end
no matter the weather
we find ours
or wait another day
fish splash in the sky
between big cloud puffs of white
there are times
when we must swim
another stream
