“DARK IS THE NIGHT
“Kill the candle boy! ”
I do as my uncle asks.
As the candle dies
see now the dark come alive
...what the candle kept at bay!
*******
DEAD CANDLE
The darkness darkened
just that little bit more than
before...allowing
ghosts...monster & murderers
time to hide under my bed.
