'No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
Am an attendant lord, one that will do
To swell a progress, start a scene or two
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool.'
Eliot's Mr. Prufrock in his famous LOVE SONG.
I stared to wonder what if it all went right...what if Hamlet got old...would it be the same. What kind of guy was Hamlet anyway...kind or the most unkindest guy of all. In some universe or other did it all get played out different. Bored out of my mind I decided to send my mind to find out...to tanka or not to tanka...ah that is the question!
