working late
through a sleepless night
today
reluctant to be called
yesterday
driving
along the creek
slugs of smoke
smudge through
the morning mist
the smiling house
feathers my feet
I quicken my pace
along the street
with a smile
restless night
wishing for what I donâ€™t have
so little sleep
blue ocean washed away
memories pulled by the tides
ghosts
of old lovers
sighing
embraces remembered
h-armless
