There they were
Up there!
East West North South
Four birds on the roof
Holding my world together
One frayed afternoon
LIKE ANGELS  (Tanka version, dedicated to Nora Olmedo)
There they were, up there
East West North South, like sentries
silent, on the roof
Holding my world together
Four birds, one frayed afternoon
