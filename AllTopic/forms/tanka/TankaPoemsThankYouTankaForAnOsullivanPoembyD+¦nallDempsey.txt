Come friendly mist &
fall on Slough....forgetting now
John Betjamin's bombs.
For has not this nowhere place
given us the poems of Niall.
******
For the venerable host of Poetrhy Unplugged for all the smiles...the puns...the poems...the words...the laughter...the love of the absurd!
Issa has a haiku wherein he implores the mist to hide his village and this put me in mind of JB's famous lines COME FREINDLY BOMBS AND FALL ON SLOUGH. Which...never said much for the place!
However it has given us the magic of Niall O' Sullivan...host and poet with the mostest. Good humoured to a fault and a perfect purveyor of words.
