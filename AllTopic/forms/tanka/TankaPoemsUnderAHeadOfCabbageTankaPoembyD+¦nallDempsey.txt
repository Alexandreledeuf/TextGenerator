My cries thrown to the skies
that witness birth of baby
in this barren field.
Seagulls mimicing my screams
as they turn into: HEADLINES.

This was the infamous KERRY BABY case in which a young girl gave birth in a field after successfully hiding her pregnancy. This was the Holy Ireland of then where the arrogance of ignorance was greater than compassion and understanding.
