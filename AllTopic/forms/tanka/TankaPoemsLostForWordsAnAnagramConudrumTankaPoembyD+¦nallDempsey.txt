LOST FOR WORDS...AN ANAGRAM CONUDRUM.
Intrigued as thieves steal
shop sign letters  A G I
L  N  N  N  O.    Like...why?
Is it a form of COUNTDOWN?
“I’ll take a consonant, Carol! ”

THE SATURDAYS ON MONDAY
Writing haiku on
the bottoms of a girl band
thanks to the METRO
then turn it into tanka
as the inspiration... grows.
HOW CHEEKY CAN YOU GET?
A bum thing to do
to write on you just because
I had no paper.
That syllabic line of mine
scrawled across your pert behinds.

I can only blame these two tanka on a severe head cold and early train travel. I was well...unwell. I had been reading about thieves nicking(of all things)   the letters off of shops...caught on CCTV. They got away with it and took specific letters as if they were trying to make up their own word. Last week it was an item about thieves stealing the guard dog and just when I had thought it couldn’t get any weirder...it got weirder! I wonder if the stolen guard dog and the nicked letters are hidden away in some gangster lock up. I didn’t have any paper to put pen to paper except the free daily I was reading so I wrote it on the front page of that upon which resided a picture of the girl band THE SATURDAYS from the rear singing their hearts out in a windy Weston-super-Mare on a Somerset Sunday. I found myself inadvertently writing the poem about the thieves on their rears so then I wrote about writing upon their rears. Maybe I should have just left the idea behind but I took it and ran with it and so...lo and behold these rare rear tankas.
