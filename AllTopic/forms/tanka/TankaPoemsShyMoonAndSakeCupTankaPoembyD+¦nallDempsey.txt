Drunk on nothing but
you...I sip...from sake cup
lips to lips I kiss
such bliss...hard to imagine.
Shy moon in window...blushing!

Sake cup is a rather flowery way of saying a part of a woman that is private to herself and a wonder to her lover...no wonder that shy moon is blushing. A veiled attempt to get around the PH site restriction. Maybe next they will ban the use of 'sake cup.'
