like a bird
we can dream and
fly alone
home though
is where the heart burns
half a crown
could it be - the king has half
the queen the other
one crown I know
half a crown yet to be told
unchained
loving these words
I hunger for your touch
I knew not then
how sweet would be your touch
Ben Franklin
flying his kite
with key exposed
electrifying
thunder clap
the dancing bee
delivers its message
coded in dream honey
others fly away to the
honey hideaway
