With eyes wide open
I cradle your sleeping head
in awe of our love
your dreams migrating quietly
from your mind to my still hands
*******
Two of the most beautiful things I treasure..falling asleep to your way past midnight smile and waking to your morning here I am smile.
A tanka to thank you for your love.
