lurid brush strokes
crossing
the shoulders of the sky
tearing apart
the morning light
ocean tides
ruffling
its skirts
arranging treasures
along the seashore
every person
has his own path
a journey
a story of a life time
to be written
my heart still sings
favorite words of a song
from my youth
I hunger for your touch
now you are here
I travel
the crossroads of your hand
looking for directions
walking on moss
soft and quiet - acceptance
