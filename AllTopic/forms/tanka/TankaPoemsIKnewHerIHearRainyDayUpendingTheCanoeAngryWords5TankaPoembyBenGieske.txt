I knew her
in her saying yes
now
I know her
even less
I hear
the tick and then
the tock
and wonder what
the clock does in between
rainy day
rummaging in the attic
things forsaken
lingering murmuring memories
all the children gone
upending the canoe
homeless
a spider cringes in retreat
she gently scoops it up
and sets it on a stone
angry words
flying
like sharp arrows
silence
remembering everything
