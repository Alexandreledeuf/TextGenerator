My heart keeps drinking shadows of the moon;
I've drowned before in darkness when it's bright;
My eyes keep spinning silence with a spoon
For silent strands to weave a dark cocoon,
Once blinded by the sweetness of the light.
My heart keeps drinking shadows of the moon
While crying tearless tears of a monsoon,
I'm choking on the shapelessness of night.
My eyes keep spinning silence with a spoon,
Your voice no longer readily in tune,
Released from pain its bitter mortal plight;
My heart keeps drinking shadows of the moon.
Your face a brightly piercing wild harpoon
Would leave me as a guardian with no sight;
My eyes keep spinning silence with a spoon
Believing it will one day be immune;
Until the light and darkness can unite,
My heart keeps drinking shadows of the moon;
My eyes keep spinning silence with a spoon.
