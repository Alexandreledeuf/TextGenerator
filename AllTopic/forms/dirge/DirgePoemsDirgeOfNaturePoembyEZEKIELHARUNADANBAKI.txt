Distress in the graying grasses
Soulful Screams of severred lilies
Flapping wings of wounded quails
Wholly adorned in man's brutality
Agony in the heart of a mother deer
Losing a fawn to the jaws of wildfire
Fleeting breath of a starving gazelle
Losing its grip to the hem of life
The sky is empty
Rivers shrink from stretching roots
and the sky derides the bearings below
Deceitful clouds gather but for form
Food trees, angered into barreness
Stand ghostly like the skeletons of ancient statues
Raising leafless arms toward Heaven
As though in prayer for clemency
Terror in the belly of elephants
like some thunder rumblings
Lions roar faintly in responds to the pangs of hunger
Ribs contours lie in utter nudity
The jungle trembles and writhes
Perspirating and shaking
lone and desolate
Whatever happened to nature
Is nature hostile to nature
Chirp birds muted by silence of nothing to say
Sing no symphony because the wind's hot
Flowers bloom fumes into the burnt-out atmosphere-A goodbye kiss to a cruel world
Bruised gardens suffer the sky a blameful stare
Lands expanse shattered and broken
Like the potter's clay
Food bowls hosts no food
Stomachs do not comprehend
Clouds vacate the sky
Rivers do not understand
Fishes swim but deserts
O' nature where gone thy pride
The aids of thy pacifier
Only if thou hears
The Soulful cry of sickly Babes
No sooner born than diseased by unhygienic environments
Their trills rise in height than the tower of babel
Their plea to the heavens speaks in innocence than the blood of Abel
Oh the world be not sane
Guilts of men, the sons of nature
it stink to Heaven!
do I blame it to Heaven's causings?
Perhaps I am thinking in the reverse.
