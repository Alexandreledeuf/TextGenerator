She came, she's gone forever; our prettiest daughter
Our sweetest child couldn't live longer
The atmospheric earth didn't allow her in birth
Clutched her pneumonic bar with polluted air at birthing mirth
Three days with three nights she's lived in lungs jar
None we can touched, just observed from far even her mother
For fluctuation of blood we're sadden always in fear
Test after test as the advice of doctor fired on our anxious hearth
Although she came, she's gone forever
As long as she lived we're in praying within fear as believer
To get back her healthy spent time in altruistic deeds all family member
Dawn to dusk all through night it seemed she's flirted love
In beseeching doctor we're shocked with broken heart
In haggard night she left us lonely to the world of another
Although she came, she's gone forever
