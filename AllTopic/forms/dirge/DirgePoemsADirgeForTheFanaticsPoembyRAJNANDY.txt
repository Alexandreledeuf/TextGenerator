-That old saying is still true,
Which you often heard people say, -
If you live by the sword,
By the same sword you  shall perish
One day!
The god you worship
Is not of  this  world of men.
This god of hatred and wanton destruction,
Is all your self-creation,
Oh you men of misguided passion!
One can never  obtain  salvation
By murdering innocent men,
On the pretext of  killing  infidels!
You have ensured for yourself
Hell fire of eternal damnation,
Oh you bunch of misguided men!
For  GOD  is  all  compassionate,
Loving  and  benevolent.
HE is not ‘ the prince of darkness’, nor
violent ;  unlike the one invoked by you,
Oh  you  bunch  of  deluded  men!
Hypnotized  by  your  illusion,
Some day, thinking them to be
Fragrant incense  of joss sticks; you may,
Offer  dynamite sticks to your god!
Thereby  annihilating  yourself
With your god, and  delivering  mankind
From the scourge of  FANATICISM, -
More terrible than Aids or Cancer,
Or   something   even    worse!
