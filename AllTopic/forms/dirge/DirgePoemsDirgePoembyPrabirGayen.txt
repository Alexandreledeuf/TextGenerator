- Dirge -
The dearest one, thought of thee tired,
Good and bad with no one to show path,
He, who never did wrong to other,
Oath,
To meet thee face to face and heed.
The loved one and who wandered lorn,
Looking thy hand of mercy on,
Place to place he moved for knowledge,
To go beyond the border vain.
No peace no gain did he attain.
Uttering words of wisdom he quitted.
The pain that he breathed looms heavy on me.
Seeking unanswered quaere, proof.
He wast within mind and very darkly,
Bearing the pain of life in disguise,
He smiled through flowers and shower,
minedid he mock the bliss of life.
In the stormy night of sleepless fear,
Stealthily did he withdraw life.
Upon the cosy breast of death,
Found he, his ultimate escape.
