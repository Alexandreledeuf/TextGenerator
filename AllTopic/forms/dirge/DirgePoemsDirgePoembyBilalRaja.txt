My mind is all over the place, I don’t know what to do
I had no one else to talk to, that’s why I’m calling you
I couldn’t take it any longer, I just had to know
I had to talk to her, now I’ll tell you of my woe
I couldn’t get any worse; I had nothing else to lose
And all this not-knowing, had me really confused
I knew it sounded crazy, and wasn’t very likely
But I asked her anyway, if she truly liked me?
She hesitated for a moment, I started to dread
I seen it in her eyes, going through lines in her head
Time stood still, I went over every scene I had read
In an apologetic tone, with one fatal, fair line she said
“How can I like you when you don’t even like yourself? ”
