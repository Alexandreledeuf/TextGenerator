Another reminder of a life once lived
Landmarks, a bond for some to share
Painful precursor three days up, seized
And death though aware
Nevertheless stood aghast
From the mouths of two in garments shining
Why seek ye among the dead the living?
He is risen, he is risen, he is risen
There, my hope for the hereafter
So on earth alive, I carry my hurts, my pains
But in a while they shall all abstain
And death shall stand aghast
For just bones, in my grave remain
Yonder, my spirit free at last
I rose, I rose, I rose
