On a warm summer night in june
through the air I heard a tearful tune
the sweet sound of a guitar crying
shedding tears for the dead and the dying
Across the water the sweet sound arose
words of requiem and beautiful prose
sad words sung for the dearly departed
sung so sad for all brokenhearted
Alive and well to tell the tale
the sounds I heard as I set sail
within the winds, within the breeze
a song so sad yet sung with ease
The sounds I heard that summer night
sailing alone in the mystic moonlight
sounds so sad, I tell you now
teardrops fell, upon the bow
On a river so calm, music abound
within myself, I felt the sound
music so sad, sad but sweet
sailing alone to that sad sounding beat.
