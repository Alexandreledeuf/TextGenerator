My Beloved Brother
(A Dirge)
Years ago you realised the truth,
The truth of futility,
Utter futility of life,
Between life and death without complex vision,
Putting life against death,
Taking life as hard food to digest.
Years ago you realised the truth,
The verity of the utter inefficacy
of the knowledge,
Of life and its Orotund Journey,
Taking death as an immediate choice,
Death was to you like an evanescent point,
Rivers fall into the vast expanse.
I was sad and even toady you are fresh like a bud,
Speaking to me in my subconscious
Nous,
Without guile you continue to speak,
You speak when the Sun is rising,
You speak when the dusk gleams,
You speak along and speak in my mind,
You speak without repentance and remorse.
I was sorrowful and distressed,
Not for the choice you made,
Thinking the mystic way about life and death,
The heavy load of pain was unbearable,
I was not a patron saint of life and its edge,
I was sad for pain that sealed my heart
for mystic Straits.
You went without notice,
Pushing with anguish in mind,
The heavy waves of life and dream profound,
From a strong tree of life,
a fresh bud of many possibilities,
You jumped into infinity,
drinking the Juice of death in single draught,
Life with all its attachments was nothing to you.
Years passed with pain and penance,
Looking at sky with wonderment,
With the sun I rise and with the sun I set,
The Moon is a living pain among mystic Stars,
On the milky way may be the subtle route,
May you walk with wonder-struck mind,
Kissing the dust of failure I nurture
my pain of losing you,
To me time has stopped to proceed.
I am with you with all my heart and being,
Pain is the bridge between two worlds
of different dosage,
I am the alpha and you are my omega,
You and me the full circle of life,
Only Lethe river between both of Us,
Sitting under the trees of knowledge
I watched you on the Cross
Wearing the crown of Thistle,
With blank eyes and Umpteen
and unuttered questions.
Blue sky is darkening now,
Heartbeat changes its rhythm,
Slow and steady breath is restless,
Within the womb of time I will be standing
to listen to your words,
The questions you left behind
Whispering like oak and pine,
I will be with you in no time.
