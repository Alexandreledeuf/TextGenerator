The wind mocks me and whispers his name,
The birds repeat it in their song,
Sensing my loneliness, they summon him,
I've been without his love far too long
His name is like sweet music playing
On a harp from some distant hill,
A love song I sing when I'm all alone...
Even the restless wind becomes still
The name of the man who holds my heart
Through this life and eternity
Is anchored to memories of the past,
Yet, his name stirs such feelings in me
My beloved's name, a sacred hymn
That stays on my lips, day and night,
Bringing me more joy than God would allow,
Though blasphemous, I'll not be contrite
In my loneliness, I call out his name,
Waiting for his gentle reply,
But when reality dawns with the day,
I obey fate's command, and I cry
I call his name...... he cannot answer,
But I must call..... so let me be!
His name, like incense rising to Heaven,
Keeps me grafted to his memory
