"Mein Herz, mein Herz ist traurig
Doch lustig leuchtet der Mai"
There's May amid the meadows,
There's May amid the trees;
Her May-time note the cuckoo
Sends forth upon the breeze.
Above the rippling river
May swallows skim and dart;
November and December
Keep watch within my heart.
The spring breathes in the breezes,
The woods with wood-notes ring,
And all the budding hedgerows
Are fragrant of the spring.
In secret, silent places
The live green things upstart;
Ice-bound, ice-crown'd dwells winter
For ever in my heart.
Upon the bridge I linger,
Near where the lime-trees grow;
Above, swart birds are circling,
Beneath, the stream runs slow.
A stripling and a maiden
Come wand'ring up the way;
His eyes are glad with springtime,
Her face is fair with May.
Of warmth the sun and sweetness
All nature takes a part;
The ice of all the ages
Weighs down upon my heart.
