‘In the cause of Right engaged
Wrongs injurious to redress
Honour’s war we strongly waged
But the Heaven’s GAVE Success! ’
To the call the country rallied
Cullloden’s ghosts murmured there:
The Union Jack, a puppet sallied…
Yes! Independence, we shall dare!
Jack came on to the battle
Bloated fat on many a feast
His followers, like sheep and cattle
Dumbly stared, as if deceased.
None were clad in morals bold
Their intellect, as blunt old spears;
Lost humanity, bought and sold
For post and title down the years.
Age old Corruption, fast enslaved them
Up her ranks the worst befell
Grinning, fawning, as she saved them
Souls burning in the fires of Hell.
No more hope of full employment
No more plans to ban the bomb;
Embracing Greed’s emolument
From Iraq back to the Somme!
Shorn of principle and vision
Labour's hacks in droves they fell
Disdainful deals in dull derision
Their ranks broke pell mell.
Blair and Brown moved Jack's mouth
He only spoke by their command
Bankrupt ideas from the South
A puppet played by slight of hand.
Ambition’s price is war and death
Our leader’s most wicked error
Hear them lie with every breath
That they will save YOU from Terror.
Bush and Blair I do declare
Spawned the terrorist spore
In Freedom’s name I do despair
The new Cold War’s bloody gore.
‘Scotland once our boast, our wonder
Fann’d by Freedom’s purer gale
When thy Wallace, arm’d with thunder
Bade the baffled Tyrant’s wail! ’
Rouse the rebel Scots to waken!
The Claim of Right and Declaration
Chains of Union slavery are breaking
Scotland stand and be a Nation!
