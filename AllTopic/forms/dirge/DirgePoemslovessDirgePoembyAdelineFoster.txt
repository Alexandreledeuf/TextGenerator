~    Love's Dirge
One there was
... Whose words were like cool waters
... To quench the thirsty rivers of the soul.
One there was
... Whose faith was like the dewdrops
... That freshen every morn that's born anew.
One there was
... Whose strength was like the redwoods-
... Unshaken by the ravages of time.
One there was
... Whose tears were like the misty rain
... That wash away the cobwebs of the heart.
One there was
... Whose heart was like the white clouds
... That tie the floating earth to heavens door.
One there was
... Whose arms were like the fireside,
... Where warmth will welcome hearts to comfort find.
One there was
... Whose loyalty was like the coast,
... Which raging waves can never wash away.
One there was
... Whose weakness was in loving
... And loved by all who knew his heart sincere.
One there was
... Whose memory lives forever,
... For good can never die though life is gone.
One there was.
... One there was.
......One there was.
