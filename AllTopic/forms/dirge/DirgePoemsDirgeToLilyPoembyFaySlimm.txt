Lily my flower
Why have you left me?
I went off this morning
Leaving you there
Standing uncovered,
Your rosy-pink softness
Displaying your beauty
To all who might stare.
Lily my blossom
Whose scent was around me,
Heady, exotic,
Encased in your glow.
Flown-away Lily
Whatever has happened?
Beautiful Lily,
Where did you go?
Petals are withered.
Fallen down ground-ward.
I stare at your stalk
Standing solitary,  - bare -.
Now who shall I talk to
On my balcony garden?
Who shall I admire, Lily,
Now you're not there?
