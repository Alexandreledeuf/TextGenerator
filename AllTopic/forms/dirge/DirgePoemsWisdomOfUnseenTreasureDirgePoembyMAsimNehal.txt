The ageless passing of the wisdom
Lies beneath your feet and yet you keep on walking
In search of knowledge, information and truth
Wake up and break this unbroken chain
Leave your sense behind and walk the walk.
The very essence to get organized is killing you
Do the things you want to do without talking
The thing you call rationalize does not exist
It is the argument of the mind with the soul
Don't make your life a file of activities
Things won't change unless you change
Don't let your Grades define your future course
Crossing the roads and wondering where to head
The sea will never be calm and without the tides
The intimidating minds will shell out the intelligence
Beware of the facts, it's going to reveal without justice
