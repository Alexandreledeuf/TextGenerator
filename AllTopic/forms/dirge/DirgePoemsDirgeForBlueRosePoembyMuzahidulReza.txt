Blue Rose, yesterday you bloomed in my garden
Spreading scants and charms
I was so happy smelling scants, enjoying charms
But after two days you got pale and dark;
Blue Rose, I showed you all
Introduced as my queen in not garden but heart
A part of it
But now I am afraid and sad;
You are passing away soon
To me it has been fully and clearly known
Oh! My unfortunate, poor heart
Once you were really great.
