Walk Straight, walk Upright, always
And when the going is tough, have patience
Don't flatter, don't rattle, by dispraise
Life will test you with, every relation.
You will be guided by your passion,
So follow your dreams, until you reach the destination.
A thousand failures, should not distract you
Away from your set goals in life
Be courageous and remain tough like few
You will earn therespect of others, despite
Death will embrace you with pride
Your life story will inspire others and guide.
