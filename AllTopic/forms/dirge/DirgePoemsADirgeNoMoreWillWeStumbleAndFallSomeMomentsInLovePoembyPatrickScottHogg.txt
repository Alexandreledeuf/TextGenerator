No more will we stumble and fall
On the sand at Portobello beach
Rolling in laughter
In love and in happiness.
No more will we stumble and fall
By the canal and the bushes
That May in Amsterdam
In fun and bliss.
No more will we stumble and fall
Reckless into each others hearts
As the bed fell apart
And we crashed and slept in chaos!
No more will we stumble and fall
Drunk in the winter snow
Wild and free as the wind
When Joy and Love were new.
No more shall we stumble and fall
Where all defenses are broken
Where love rushes in like the tide
When your eyes were my heaven
