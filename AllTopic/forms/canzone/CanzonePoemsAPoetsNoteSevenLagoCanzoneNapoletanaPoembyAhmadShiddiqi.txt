(dedicated to Little Morning Star, a poet friend at poemhunter)
I saw that she had tears
running down pink cheeks
she slowly turned bright red
how beautiful God's creature!
neither I nor her was ready
to tell about our feeling
finally I took her hand
I was able to feel
why this has been going on?
our dreams follow the inner will
I was ready to fly to her illusion
I've promised not to let her down
