'All things end, '
And I knew that from the start,
Now I need to say it
To a very stubborn heart.
She refuses to believe,
She refuses to see,
That the pain inside will vanish,
Once I set you free.
There are no misgivings, dearest,
I could not have loved you more,
So in tenderness, I bid you
'Addio, senza rancore.'
