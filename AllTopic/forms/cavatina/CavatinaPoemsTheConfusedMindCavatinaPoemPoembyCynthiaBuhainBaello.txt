Some jokers make me laugh at their folly,
without words said.
At Oscars night one did,when he wore a tux
and dress instead.
The clown felt grand with all the attention,
swirling his skirt.
But he had nothing of a woman's form
under his shirt.
These jesters make fools of themselves always,
and want respect.
They can flaunt their perverted views on us -
these we reject.
The Confused pretend but the truth is there.
They change clothes and body..... their mind, never.
