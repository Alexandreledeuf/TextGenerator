Perhaps because Pain stayed rather too long
it made me numb.
I've faced it so often that to coldness
now I succumbed.
Strange how the constancy of tears may seem
like rain falling.
And it's true the heart gets used to it,
always breaking.
Happiness looks far like the distant sun,
no longer warm.
I go on blind and deaf to love for it
has lost its charm.
The heart can only take so much and learns.
Some find true love, some don't, and some get burned.
