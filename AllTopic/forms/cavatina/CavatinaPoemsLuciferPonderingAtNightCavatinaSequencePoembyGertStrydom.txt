(after George Meredith)
Having rebelled against the divine,
the evil fiend
grows wary of his dreary dominion,
without a friend
in strive against reasonable nature;
seeing his end,
for lingering moments he is in awe
of beings following God's righteous law.
Love, loving, procreation and order
is beyond him,
as time passes on, his future looks
constantly dim;
he longs to be back among the bright stars,
both his eyes swim
but his mind stays set to have this earth,
for a moment he smiles in utter mirth.
Above his head planets and stars shine bright,
it is darkness
that still surrounds him while he is unseen,
his godliness,
his power, still is in his ragged mind,
in his madness
he does know that against God he can win,
earth has to become a place of endless sin.
