Thinking of your work and life, a yearning
to earn much more;
where now I do lack all kinds of good things,
where you deplore
me for my lack to breed, build and to become
great as before;
still I have a good sense of confidence
while my words are reaching for excellence.
Yet with similar conviction I am
still reaching out
to a world that is beyond all human sight,
loud you may shout
and act in word and deed very harshly
and bring about
great acts of violence and great strife
while unseen forces of darkness wreck my life;
but hours and days of utter loneliness
wreaks their havoc
and forever ticking and running on
is the old clock;
wealth and snobbism enfolds you like a cloak;
running amok
are the words and deeds of my enemies
while constantly I only long for peace.
