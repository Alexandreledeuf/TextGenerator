Overpowering the machine mowed
with its roaring
stifling all other kinds of garden sounds,
the nylon string
of the edge cutter frayed at times
and approaching
a butterfly fluttered about
in silence, far away was a child's shout.
Wild doves and sparrows pecked small insects
on the green lawn,
orange hoopoes were fluttering about
while some did fawn
where I had laboured lonely hours
after first dawn,
extremely bright shone the white hot sun,
on another summer day full of great fun.
