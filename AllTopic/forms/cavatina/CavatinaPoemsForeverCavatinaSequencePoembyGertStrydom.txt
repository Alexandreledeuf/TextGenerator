Forever in and out the waves roll on,
poplars quiver
as the breeze time and again rushes through them,
the small river
is slowly flowing twisting to the sea
birds deliver
worms, seed and fruit chirping to new hatchlings,
cheerful they sing and fly and slap their wings.
It feels as if all the time in the world
we still have got
when you give me a small token as a
forget-me-not;
time suddenly gets wings and I love you
more than a lot;
the sun rises and again it does descend
while all of life feels as it has no end.
