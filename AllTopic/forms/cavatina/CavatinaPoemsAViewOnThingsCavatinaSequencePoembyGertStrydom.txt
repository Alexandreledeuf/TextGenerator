We are puzzled, sometimes we are stunned,
in the sheer face
of beauty; loveliness catches the eye,
with a pure grace,
enigmatic we view morning-glories,
things commonplace
like the blue sky on a clear open day
are serene in the view that they portray.
Sometimes the sea plays its optical tricks
in on the mind,
as if changing its feelings with its hue;
daily we find
azure, cobalt blue, green and grey colours
that does remind
of times of happiness, of joy and pain;
too absolute some colours do remain.
If we get too close perspective is lost,
yet we still know
the true shape and colouring of a thing,
or a inner glow,
a white shimmering brings a universe
the eyes do show
that does not exist in our true sight,
sometimes brings to darkness another light.
