(after Robert Frost)
In passing the nearby snow filled great woods
and icy lake,
the sheer loveliness caught the riderâ€™s eye;
a halting break
that lingers too long could bring freezing death,
a spell in each flake
brought tiredness, but the horse moved on,
breaking that old spell, its magic was gone.
