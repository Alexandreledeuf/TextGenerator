a ricochet they play for love.

of molded clay they play for love.

in rash parley they play for love.

in hideaways, they play for love.

on vertebrae they play for love.
Glissandi slip from fingertips,
a strummed segue they play for love.

in worded fray they play for love.
Shady names inflame with games
in sobriquet, they play for love.
Players love and lovers play
I love to play, I play for love.
