In my life there is room after room of good things
my man is one room for whom thanks-I-am-giving.
.
I do not know what good seeds I have been sowing
but for not reaping from my bad deeds thanks-I-am-giving.
.
Every day my life kite through the sky is tripping
and through good times and bad times is zipping but thanks-I-am-giving.
.
The morning breeze a brand new essence is bringing
and blessings like flowers are budding and blooming and thanks-I-am giving.
.
When adventure comes a-horseback and hoofbeats are reigning
then the hills are ringing and singing with thanks-I-am-giving.
