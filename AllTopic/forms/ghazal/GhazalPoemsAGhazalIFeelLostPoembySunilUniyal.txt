I don't know why, it's strange but true-
I feel lost in front of you
Virtues in me are too many,
You take only a bird's eye-view.
What is all this roaming about?
Why is life a wandering Jew?
In this world of tasks undone,
Days are like the morning dew.
Here's a city of millions where,
Uni's  been seeking  friends few.
