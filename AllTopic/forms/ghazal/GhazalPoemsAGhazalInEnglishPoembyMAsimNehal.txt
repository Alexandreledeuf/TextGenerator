The buds of wishes have grown and became flowers, now.
The fragrance of it is spreading to all parts and directions, now.
What my mind conceived and heart did not endorse
Has remained like a storybook in shelf, now.
The waves of my youth life that reached its zenith
Has started to calm down year by year, now.
The inner voice of my conscience
Has become an unsolved question, now.
The stroke of my pen produced a poetry
Like the Taj Mahal, a symbol of love, now.
