Suspicion consumed me
As it does to this day
Lined by desire
I hid the wounds in my heart
You make it all end in tears
Values are abandoned
As if a thorn were pulled out of my heart
Tears spill from my eyes
Lights still burn but the place is deserted
Once faith was unshakeable
A head of snow at my shoulder
Once we were a tongue of flame
Loneliness is my twin
Were there ever such twins before?
