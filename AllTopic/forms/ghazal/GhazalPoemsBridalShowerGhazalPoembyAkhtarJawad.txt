Love is my habit I am helpless sweetheart,
Wish in your heart I get access sweetheart.
I'll not let you go you are prisoner of heart,
Pass a few days of recess lifelong sweetheart.
It's your beauty that raged this war of love,
Now face with smile consequences sweetheart.
Surrender unconditional, I shall impose on you,
Imprisonment of life, are sentences sweetheart.
A night is followed after all sunny days,
Like moon light I see are the chances sweetheart.
Should I purchase uniforms for the pretty nice prisoner?
I have seen a few charming bridal dresses sweetheart.
Wish you the dreams of lovely bridal shower,
I can imagine that's not in access sweetheart.
