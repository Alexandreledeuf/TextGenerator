When a voice is not heard it's nicely seen,
When ears are inactive my eyes are keen.
In all my senses it's touch instrumental,
Sixth sense of the soul is a touch unseen.
How bold is your heart my shy beloved!
Heard all untold and I saw the unseen.
Language of love is truly universal,
The body language celebrates Halloween.
Long hairs when silky and perfumed as well,
Comb of fingers learns how to preen.
I asked you agreed no words exchanged,
I never knew so simple it has been.
So all the senses touched her at last,
Spectrum of life is pink and green.
In a moonlit night that was cloudy and wet,
Princess was crowned as the ruling queen.
