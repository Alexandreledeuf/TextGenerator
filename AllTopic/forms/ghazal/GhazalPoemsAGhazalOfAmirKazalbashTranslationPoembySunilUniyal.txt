life's an evening without dawn, buddy
why are you awake all night, buddy?
i'm weary of travelling on and on,
when will this journey end, buddy?
why does the sea turn into a mirage,
have you any inkling of this, buddy?
though near me, but still too far-
that's how you see my goal, buddy.
in search of life, let me wander,
why pass the age in regret, buddy?
