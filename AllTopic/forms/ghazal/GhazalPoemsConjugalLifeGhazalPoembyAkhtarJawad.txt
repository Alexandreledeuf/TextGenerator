Life that is past in love is life, nothing is rest,
It's good it's better no doubt is the best.
Two birds ignorant what happens in the world,
Satisfied, content and happy in the nest!
Feeding outcomes of love with the nibs,
Great glimpses of God on a real loving test!
Playing with young ones teaching how to fly,
Imitation is a teacher with mighty manifest.
Provisions scattered on the bosom of the earth,
Leading young ones to a mother at her best!
It's life, it's prayer, it's what God wants to see,
When birds fly high they fly with a crest.
I am sure in the gardens of high skies,
In flowers of diamonds and pearls is a nest,
Where birds incubate there golden eggs,
Fairies are in fact an outcome of the crest.
