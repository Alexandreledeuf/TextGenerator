Joyous, blissful moment, sitting on the porch, you and I
two forms, two faces, yet one soul together, you and I
The groves' gift, the birds' songs give us the water of ever
lasting life, when we come to the garden together, you and I
The stars of the night sky witness us
we show them the moon together, you and I
You and I united as one in ecstasy and delight
cast aside absurd stories and nonsense, you and I
The parrots of the sky eat sugar when we are
in the veranda, laughing together, you and I
How amazing are we here this moment in this corner
yet we are also together in Irâq and Khorâsân, you and I
We are in one form on the earth and in another in the
everlasting land of honey - the paradise, you and I
