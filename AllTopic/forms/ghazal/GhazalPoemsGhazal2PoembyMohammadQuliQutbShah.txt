The God of love, the clouds, the nipples, the beloved are all excited
The wind, the zephyr, the love, the beloved are all excited
The dot on her forehead, her forelock the carefully applied lippaint are all excited
The sweets, the kisses, the laughter, the beloved are excited
The blouse, its revealing condition, the lotus, the beetle are all excited
Qutub, her well-developed breasts [and] she herself are all excited
