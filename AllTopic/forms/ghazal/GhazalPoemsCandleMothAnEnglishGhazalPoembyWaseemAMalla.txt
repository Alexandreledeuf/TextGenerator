In the far away lands I saw its glare,
The candle at which the moths do stare;
There I sat with my mates to see- How,
The moths embrace death? How they dare?
Came a sound from the midst of the crowd,
Challenging my art in taunt and in jeer;
Confident, I spoke to them of the moths,
The ones who circumbulate the fire;
And I spoke to them of the candle,
To which all those fragile beings cower;
Bonds of life, of death and of love,
I spoke to them of the cotton they share;
They asked why do only moths die so,
Why is that the candle seems not to care;
Little did they watch the fiery beloved,
Lit at the dusk, and at dawn not there!
As it mourns the death of a pilgrim,
Weeping I saw it, in its eye a tear;
It is in the nature of love when pure,
The lover, the beloved- nobody does it spare!
All in vain, moth tried to plant a kiss,
The flames bent a little in utter despair;
By then the moth had become eternal,
Precious was no more the candle's flare;
love- the dirtiest of the nature's forces,
Knows no warning, knows no scare;
Love absorbed the two & I, the crowd,
August the way, Waseem ended the affair.
