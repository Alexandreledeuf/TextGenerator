They say your eyes have seen dreams, when did you sleep?
Where everyone remains sleeping, how do you remain awake?
Those doors are special where air asks for permission,
Where no one can go, how did you enter there.
And for whom the lights awaits for illumination
How the darkness did sent you there?
And who is self-sufficient and have abundant resources "MAN"
How did HE send you empty handed.
