Fragrance has scattered in the wind
The birds have flown from the orchid
It is about to rain as clouds have grown thick
And the earth will satisfy its thirst
When nature plays tricks
How can the heart remain untouched?
Let free your wishes to dance
Let free your heart to sing
Who knows tomorrow they may not be there?
And this earth will be surrounded by smoky air.
