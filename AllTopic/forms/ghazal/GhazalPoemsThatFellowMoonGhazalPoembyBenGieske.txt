When I first saw you, I felt a hello-moon,
Like I was phasing into a tallow moon,
Sitting in a chair/hands moving/crocheting,
And I longed only for your allow-me moon.
A sweater, scarf – I really didn’t notice.
My eyes were still hazy with a sallow moon.
Watching your fingers back and forth back and forth.
My swaying and shimmering with a jello-moon,
Wanting to learn the warp of your creating,
Caught up in the glowing of a halo-moon.
Teach me teach me how your Christmas fingers fly.
I’m ripe for learning/spring in this fallow moon.
Drawn into your eyes I feel their allure.
Ben, said I, it’s time/forget that fellow moon.
