All the calendars measure the months of the seasons;
None of them painting the same scenario for all.
Still all know the reasons for the different seasons.
The sea goes its own way being a world all its own.
The climatic law of the land is washed away.
Those that sail the oceans learn of different seasons.
Then there’s the world of fine food not without its seasons.
Every chef knows how to season the food he cooks
Whether it be for health or even the taste of the season.
Age is not content to contemplate just four seasons.
With love there are many seasons of the heart to explore.
I for one know some but, by far, not all its seasons.
We are not beyond the influence of outer space.
Not only the oceans are subject to the moon’s pull.
It would do us well to understand the moon’s seasons.
Sharing is a must to accompany our reasons
If we truly intend to know all of heart’s seasons.
No one, even I, knows all of heart’s many seasons.
