Where to begin and then end this saga of stone;
On Mt. Sinai with the Ten Commandments of stone?
With the mighty megaliths of Britainâ€™s Stonehenge?
Start we will from the beginning when there was stone.
Centuries ago some built fires in caves of stone;
Drew wild animals and hunters on walls of stone.
On dark nights some read moving stars, measured the moon;
And for each month some chose a special precious stone.
Behold the pyramids and amphitheaters
Enduring the centuries - monuments of stone.
Nothing is more lasting than a flat slab of rock;
Why streams flow along many pebbled beds of stone.
As people reborn some live the life of the Son;
His stone from the tomb found rolled back on Easter morn.
Relieving us all of weariness in our bones,
Fateful death lays us low at the foot of a stone.
Content will I be with B. J. G. chiseled there
While forever reposing in that outer zone.
