Each morning I take a lonely stroll in the woods.
Enter the romantic reverence of the woods.
An avian symphony grace me company.
En plein air I sense warming comfort in the woods.
Phasing colors of a youthful sun shadow me.
What deep memories are held captive in the woods.
Pictorial web of endless variety.
Shuffling, wading through the wilderness of the woods.
Liquid mosaic in the marshes dazzles me.
Wearing through the deep mysteria of the woods.
The breezes whisper their secrets eternally.
A final wish mine/ashes dreaming in the woods.
