O my lover! I'm the parched earth awaiting a union with you
O my lover! Take me in your arms and let our breasts meet each other
Offer me the cup of love time and again
For you're my companion in this life and other world
I won't shelter you in my eyes but in my heart
For you're my lover and the life-partner
If I get separated from my lover even for a moment
My eyes shed tears equal to the waters of seven seas
The beloved of Qutuba declares that with the blessing of the Prophet
I'll offer him cups of love again and again
