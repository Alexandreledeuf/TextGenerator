.
In my life there is room after room of good things
my man is one room for whom thanks-I-am-giving.
.
I do not know what good seeds I have been sowing
but for not reaping bad deeds thanks-I-am-giving.
.
Every day my life kite is tripping through the sky
and time zones are zipping but thanks-I-am-giving.
.
The morning breeze is bringing a brand new essence
the blue birds are singing and thanks-I-am-giving.
.
Hoofbeats rain thunder singing through the desert night
and the hills are ringing with thanks-I-am-giving.
