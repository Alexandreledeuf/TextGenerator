My soul smiles with the flowers of your love,
Pleasant and soothing are the showers of your love.
I can go any time but I don't know why,
I love this cage in the towers of your love.
How sweet are the dreams in a shadow so dense!
I love to sleep in the bowers of your love.
In love of a beauty I am odor and color,
So many thanks to the mowers of your love.
How weak I was how strong I am,
I bow my head to the powers of your love.
Your beauty I feel, it's scattered in me,
Many flowers sprung by sowers of your love.
Is it your beauty that I describe,
Or it's just the avowers of your love.
