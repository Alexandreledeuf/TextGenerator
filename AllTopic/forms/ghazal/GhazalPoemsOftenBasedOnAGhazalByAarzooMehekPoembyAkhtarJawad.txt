You are in habit of avoiding me often?
But you are in habit of loving me often!
I am in habit of erasing me in love,
for erasing I love writing me often.
Loneliness is the cause of my craziness,
But I love a lonely roaming often.
Promises he loves to make so much,
with a habit of denying me often!
In your love I've earned a too bad name,
thanks for your love framing me often.
Sufficient for sinking, your too deep eyes,
a naughtiness too crazing me often.
Oh pleasure of love, the peace you provide,
is followed by fires  burning me often.
