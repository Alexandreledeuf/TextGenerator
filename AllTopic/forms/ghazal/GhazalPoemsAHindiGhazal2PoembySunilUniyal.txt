Original~
lahar thee, tata par bikhar gayi
zindagi yoon hee guzar gayi
unhi raaston par kataa safar
guzare the log jinse kayi
chehraa jo bhi hamko milaa
usee par dikhe mukhaute kayi
kis but se karen shikvaa ham
sochate rahe din-raat yahi
sayaano ne bahut samjhaayaa
par  rahe ham vahi ke vahi
shabd-jaal hee hamne bune,
hamse hui na koyi baat nayi
Translation~
Dissipating itself like a wave on the shore,
This life has been just that, nothing more.
Same roads I've travelled again and again
Through which have so many passed in vain.
Every face that I met on the way
Had masks manifold, I must say.
Which idol I should my plaint address,
Day and night I'm under this stress.
The wise have advised me times umpteen,
But I've remained what I've been.
I just wove webs with many a word,
Nothing was new in what I've uttered.
