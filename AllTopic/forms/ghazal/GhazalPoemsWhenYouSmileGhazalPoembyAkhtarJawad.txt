You smile sweetheart many flowers sprung,
Wordsworth and Shelley and Keats are sung.
Tide of beauty brings out many pearls,
Ugliness sweeps out like dirt and dung.
My days are yours my nights are yours,
You are a song round the clock it's sung.
I remember sweetheart a heart I had,
With your earrings something is hung.
I cannot see if your eyes are wet,
My heart with you, see never it's wrung.
