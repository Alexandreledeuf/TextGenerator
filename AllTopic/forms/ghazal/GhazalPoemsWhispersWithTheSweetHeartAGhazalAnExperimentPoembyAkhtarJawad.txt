Not important sweetheart what your brain concedes,
Important is the truth of your heart it feeds.
Not important sweetheart, how much knowledge you have,
Important is application when you sow its seeds.
Not important sweetheart, how nice is your belief,
Important is its reflection in your day to day deeds.
Not important sweetheart your outer charms,
Important is attraction from inside that pleads.
Not important sweetheart the smiles and joys,
Important is attention to the eye that bleeds.
Not important sweetheart forget your sins,
Important is regression after human misdeeds,
Not important sweetheart, how much I love you,
Important is my passion in the time of needs.
