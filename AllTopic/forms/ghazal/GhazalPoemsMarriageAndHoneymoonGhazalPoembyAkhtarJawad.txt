Your meetings are nice but separation is a boon,
I talk to stars and walk with the moon,
While jogging on the tracks of the Milky Ways,
I search a place for our honeymoon.
Haven't found any place that suits to you,
Come back on the earth in a sunny winter noon.
My sweet mother is charming like you,
She says bring the bride I'll manage it soon.
I trust my mother she never told a lie,
Be prepared for the marriage very very soon.
Now like a good girl in a lonely bedroom,
Wish you sweet dreams of charming honeymoon!
