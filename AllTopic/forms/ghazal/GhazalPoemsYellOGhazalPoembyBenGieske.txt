Not much comes to mind now as I think of something yellow
Except that Beetle Song that happens to mention yellow.
I do not care to cite a certain bird I know by name
Which of all living colors has a belly gleaming yellow
And how can I forget the time that youthful Dorothy
Sauntered with her friends along that road whose bricks were yellow.
So how am I to continue and finish this poem piece
If I can’t conjure more things which know the color yellow?
Let me see — are there fruits I know with that color? .
Is it a lemon that’s lemon colored or all yellow?
As I now recall, I can see there being in the fields
Some flowers still growing wild and proud of beaming yellow.
And last of all, I want to close with one fulfilling thought.
I wish to be the one who hears that harvest moon yell, O!
