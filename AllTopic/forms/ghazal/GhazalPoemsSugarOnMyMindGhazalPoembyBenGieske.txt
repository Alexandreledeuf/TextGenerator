Can we think of anything sweet and not think of sugar?
There are just two many things that remind us of sugar.
We all have inner pulsing passions for pleasures of a sugarland.
It isn’t just bears who hibernate and search for honey-flowing sugar.
We are always searching new horizons like so many venturers before,
willing to sail seas and oceans in our quest for exotic spices and sugar.
When I taste your sweetness within with a kiss,
It’s no wonder that I seek all your sweetness of sugar.
Gliding over the curves and mounds of your body quivering with
whispering traces, soft and delicate as an Acuna baby eating sugar.
Like dazzling sugar crystals your eyes sweeten
my longings for your gift of sugarland.
Baby Ben, you loved all the sweets of boyhood sugar.
Now Big Ben, you can’t easily do without sugar.
